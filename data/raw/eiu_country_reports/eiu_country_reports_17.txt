Full text: - The outbreak of the coronavirus resulted in the imposition of significant restrictions on economic activity and population, generating a recession in 2020, with output forecast to contract by 3.5% for the full year. Fiscal stimulus measures, as well as a substantial decline in oil sector revenue, will generate a looser fiscal stance that will persist throughout the forecast period (2020-24).
- Norway has a history of coalition governments and cross-party consensus, delivering high levels of political stability. The constitution does not allow for the dissolution of parliament. The ruling coalition comprises the Conservatives, the Liberals and the Christian Democrats (KrF) as a minority government, with 61 seats in the 169-seat parliament. The next election is in September 2021, and The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the centre-right bloc to re-enter government, owing to its competent handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
- We do not expect a reimposition of a national lockdown (although some municipal measures are likely) even in the event of a revival of infections. The economy will recover from 2021 to 2024, reaching 2019 levels by 2022, with growth averaging 2.4% as restrictions on mobility recede.
- We estimate that inflation will soften to 1.2% on average in 2020, from 2.2% in 2019, owing to worsening economic conditions, but pressures on core inflation from rising food prices pose an upside risk to price growth. Economic recovery will generate a rebound in inflation throughout the forecast period, generating inflation averaging 1.6% in 2021-24.
- In March Norges Bank (the central bank) reversed much of its monetary tightening, lowering interest rates by a total of 125 basis points, to 0.25%. Core inflation is falling as demand declines, and rates are expected to remain stable until the end of 2020. A steady policy of normalisation will follow, with policy rates reaching 1.5% by 2024.

- Norway's business environment score rises slightly in 2020-24, as the economy has become more resilient following oil industry reforms. Backed by vast oil wealth, the political and economic environments are robust, and financing opportunities should remain firm. Norway lags Nordic peers in some areas, with limited market opportunities, tight labour market regulation and high wages.

Country forecast overview: Norway's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: Low regulatory burden, but probable rise in already high level of state influence in the economy, following emergency policy measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic and related temporary lockdown.
2022-24: A strategic plan guides the Norwegian Competition Authority to raise sectoral competition and procurement rules.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Generally positive attitude towards attracting foreign direct investment, but capital inflows constrained by weak global economy and new domestic investment screening regime that can block investment on national security grounds.
2022-24: The economy further diversifies investor countries beyond Europe, although to limited effect.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: Absorbing the shock to global trade from the coronavirus will be a major theme, with a discussion around "reshoring" strategic industries away from China likely to follow the immediate crisis.
2022-24: No change in policy towards joining the EU or leaving the European Economic Area (EEA). A reassessment of EEA membership is possible, but unlikely. Efforts to promote bilateral trade deals continue.
Taxes 2020-21: Temporary stimulus measures and easing of tax-payment requirements for firms in response to coronavirus.
2022-24: Government investigates reform of subsidy regime for oil and gas exploration. Expansion of environmental taxes to meet climate change goals.
Financing 2020-21: Significant expansion of central bank liquidity to support functioning of financial markets. Policy interest rates remain at record-low level. Private-sector balance sheets weakened by economic fallout from the crisis.
2022-24: Credit demand likely to remain subdued following the crisis, but opportunities could emerge for growth of non-bank financing channels, including private equity and venture capital. Tighter anti-money-laundering rules.
The labour market 2020-21: The coronavirus shock leads to a sharp increase in unemployment
2022-24: Improvements in employment and wages follow the crisis. Skills shortages remain an issue in some sectors.
Infrastructure 2020-21: Government applies 12-year transport plan (2018-29) and raises funds available for maintenance and construction of infrastructure projects. Gradual roll-out of fifth-generation (5G) mobile services.
2022-24: Investments in new road and rail transport links are made. Digital infrastructure upgrades continue.
Technological developments 2020-21: Implementation of Norway's cyber-defence strategy, after cyber-attacks on national infrastructure.
2022-24: The Open Artificial Intelligence (AI) lab grows in size and importance, underpinning AI preparedness.

a Actual.
Background: The Labour Party governed almost continuously in 1935-65, dominating until 2001, when a minority coalition comprising the Conservatives, the Christian Democrats (KrF) and the Liberals swept to power. In 2005 Labour returned to office in a centre-left coalition with the Socialist Left Party (SV) and the Centre Party-the first majority government in two decades-lasting until 2009. The September 2013 election led to a regime change, with a minority right-of-centre coalition of the Conservatives and the Progress Party (FrP) taking office. The centre-right coalition was re-elected in 2017. The Conservatives and the FrP were joined by the Liberals in January 2018 and by the KrF in January 2019.
Political structure: There is no right of dissolution between elections. Norway uses a modified proportional representation system: 150 out of the 169 members of the unicameral Storting (parliament) are "district mandates" elected by open-list proportional representation. The remaining 19 seats, the "levelling mandates", are distributed only between the parties that get more than 4% of the national vote and whose initial seat count (out of 150) is not proportional to their share of the vote.
Policy issues: The centre-right government will try to implement additional business-friendly policies and tax cuts, focused on further reducing the negative spillover effects of lower oil prices on wider economic activity and on strengthening the mainland economy. Spending from Norway's oil fund is expected to rise, but it will remain comfortably within the country's fiscal guidelines. Despite a cross-party agreement on tackling climate change, tension will persist in the Storting over the balance between industrial development and environmental protection.
Taxation: At the start of 2016 most parties agreed on a multi-year corporation tax reduction (from 27% to 23% by 2018) to improve competitiveness in the economy; it has since been reduced to 22% in 2019. Oil companies pay an additional flat-rate tax of 50% on income derived from the extraction, processing and transport of oil, but benefit from a 78% tax refund on the costs of exploration for oil and gas. The capital-gains tax was cut from 28% to 27% in 2014. The ordinary rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 25%. The top marginal income tax rate is 54.3% (including employers' social security contributions).
Foreign trade: Oil and gas output and prices greatly affect Norway's trade flows. The petroleum industry contributes about half of total goods export revenue. In 2016 the trade account registered its lowest level since 1999, but has been recovering since. The current-account surplus increased to US$16.7bn in 2019, down from US$31.1bn in the previous year. The trade and current-account balance will remain in surplus throughout the forecast period (2020-24).

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The current ruling coalition, comprising the centre-right Conservatives and two small centrist parties-the Liberals and the Christian Democrats (KrF)-is coming to the end of its term in September 2021. The coalition rules as a minority government, with just 61 members in the 169-seat parliament, after the far-right Progress Party (FrP) withdrew from government in January 2020 after a coalition dispute over infrastructure. Given the nearing of the next general election, scheduled for September 2021, and a strong tradition of political consensus, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect a change in government.
Despite the government being a minority in parliament, it is able to pass legislation with the backing of the FrP (which has pledged to support it in significant parliamentary votes). The ruling coalition can also rely on the support of other opposition parties (such as the centre-left Labour Party). Although the FrP will probably withdraw its support for the government on some matters (preventing the proposal of some legislation), the damage to political stability would be low, as the constitution prohibits a pre-term dissolution of parliament, and a snap election.
In the near term the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has strengthened the stabilising influences on the political outlook. The government has mostly unwound its restrictions on social interaction, after being among the first group of European countries to experience an outbreak of the disease. Public support for the ruling parties has strengthened markedly during the crisis, and political support for the lockdown was wide-ranging. Despite the economic disruption caused by the lockdown, there has been no increase in support for populist parties in Norway. Populist movements have historically had limited electoral appeal in the country, as the far-right FrP takes a largely pragmatic approach to government, in contrast with other European populist movements. Their presence has only a marginal impact on political stability, as the domestic political culture is highly consensus-driven, with frequent collaboration between the government and opposition parties on a range of issues.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch The next general election will be held in September 2021. The Storting (parliament) cannot be dissolved before completing a full four-year term, meaning that there is no risk of a snap election. A change in government is also not part of our forecast.
Although the handling of the coronavirus crisis is likely to shape political preferences in the run-up to the election, it is unclear how much of an effect it will have by September 2021. The governing bloc of right-wing parties (excluding the FrP) have seen their popular support increase in the wake of the pandemic, a feature common to most countries. We expect the government's competent handling of the coronavirus crisis to place the right-wing bloc in a good position before the election in 2021, although the decline in support for the FrP since 2017 means they may not be able to produce a stable majority.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations EU relations will remain a significant foreign policy issue, and may steadily encroach on domestic politics as environmental affairs become increasingly prominent. As a member of the European Economic Area, Norway has access to the single market (in exchange for contributions to the EU budget), but must accept relevant EU regulations while having limited influence over them. This has historically been accepted as a substitute for outright EU membership (which has been rejected twice in national referendums in 1972 and 1994), but mounting concern over economic diversification and a reduction in carbon emissions has pushed environmentalist parties (the Greens and the Liberals) to support outright EU membership. Although we do not expect Norway to join the EU without a national referendum, political pressure for a third plebiscite on the matter may grow in tandem with environmentalist influence in the government. Norway will be under continued pressure to raise its defence spending, which at 1.8% of GDP, is below NATO's 2% target. Greater commitments to increase spending will take time to implement, and will probably only be met by the end of 2024.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends The country has recorded a steady increase in coronavirus cases, in tandem with other European countries, since social distancing measures were largely unwound from June onwards. The number of new cases recorded each day rose from 9 on July 24th to 126 on August 25th. The increase in cases has primarily been among young people, meaning mortality rates remain low, but a substantial "second wave" of viral transmission (and death) through the wider population remains possible. The rise in cases has halted government efforts to loosen social distancing measures, and the imposition of regional controls (similar to those seen throughout Europe) is likely to form a component of the government's new anti-virus strategy.
Beyond the coronavirus crisis, the sharp fall in oil prices will probably re-focus government attention on diversifying the economy away from the oil sector. Emergent industries in fishing, professional services and light manufacturing will probably receive more extensive government support, despite the deterioration in the fiscal position. Recent political success for environmentalist parties nationally, and the departure of the FrP from the ruling coalition, will place the generous tax reimbursement policy for oil exploration (which compensates 70% of exploration costs if there is no discovery) under strain. Nevertheless, we expect the system to be maintained throughout the forecast period, as all major parties are committed to the oil sector's growth.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy Like other European countries, Norway has announced fiscal stimulus in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, although this is much smaller than in peer economies. Given a long history of fiscal probity, Norway has a greater level of fiscal space than most, meaning that we expect public debt to remain below 60% of GDP throughout the forecast period. Total discretionary stimulus has amounted to about Nkr160bn (US$16bn), or about 5.5% of mainland GDP. The budget that the government presented in October 2019 has been abandoned as the disruption from the coronavirus generates a shock to the mainland economy (with the oil sector broadly cushioned by greater production). The government's budget, presented in mid-May, targets a substantial withdrawal from the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG; 4.2% of its value) to fund further expenditure, in breach of the government's fiscal rule to not withdraw more than 3% of the sovereign fund's value in any year. We expect that the government will have to lean on the fund for further fiscal support in the coming years, but this will not diminish its vast size. For the first time since 1993, this will not be enough to prevent a deficit in 2020, which we forecast at just 0.9% of GDP.
Existing government support for the labour market is similar to the measures implemented in response to the coronavirus in neighbouring countries. Under the system of permittering, the government temporarily pays a large portion (more than 60%) of the wages of workers who are placed on furlough. Expanded take-up of this scheme, although it will preserve much of the existing labour market for the duration of the pandemic, will leave the government liable for a significant increase in spending.
On the employer side, fiscal support has expanded rapidly. The government has deferred tax payments and purchased corporate bonds on the secondary market, reducing borrowing costs for businesses. About Nkr20bn has been set aside as a crisis fund to cover fixed costs for businesses during the coronavirus pandemic, modelled on the Danish fund set up for this purpose.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy In response to the substantial disruption caused by the pandemic, Norges Bank (the central bank) has lowered the policy rate by 150 basis points since February, to 0%-the lowest rate in modern history. This unprecedented monetary easing was completed over three meetings of the monetary policy committee. The central bank also lowered countercyclical capital buffers for major banks from 2.5% to 1% to ensure bank solvency and expand credit growth.
We expect Norges Bank to maintain its highly accommodative policy until the end of 2021, given the lingering uncertainty around the pace of economic recovery and the trajectory of the pandemic, which will weigh on business and con-sumer confidence. There are likely to be substantial scarring effects on both output and employment from the virus, with looser monetary policy required to accelerate the recovery in the near term. Looking ahead, Norges Bank targets inflation of "close to 2% over time", and the policy rate should rise steadily after 2021 when economic conditions improve. The steady rise in oil prices, gradual recovery of the domestic economy and revival in global trade should all generate a steady normalisation of interest rates over the forecast period.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth The imposition of lockdown measures from March 12th to June 15th generated a substantial contraction in headline output, by 5.1% in the second quarter, as 11 of the 14 weeks of restrictions took place in that time. This comes after a 1.7% quarterly decline in the first quarter. But the performance of the mainland and offshore economies has diverged, with the mainland economy contracting by 7.6% annually (in line with the performance of other Nordic economies) but the offshore economy expanding by 9.7%, as the activation of the Johan Sverdrup oilfield boosts real production. The recent increase in viral infections could generate a reimposition of some social distancing measures, which would curtail the extent of the recovery. We judge that long-term scarring from the crisis will be significant, but modest compared with peer economies, as government support to counter short-term disruption to the labour market will remain substantial.
The pandemic and subsequent lockdown will primarily affect consumer spending and export demand, which we expect to decline by 6.5% and 5.8% respectively in 2020. For the mainland economy, the imposition of lockdown and continued uncertainty around the trajectory of the virus will increase precautionary saving and cool fixed investment (which we expect to contract by 4.5%). Weakened external demand, owing to widespread lockdowns, alongside disruption to trade, will curtail the growth of non-oil exports and reduce industrial activity throughout the rest of 2020. By contrast, in the offshore economy, real activity has been boosted by the activation of the Johan Sverdrup field, the third-largest discovery in Norwegian history, which will raise offshore output in annual terms for the rest of the year. We expect these divergent trends to blunt the force of coronavirus on headline output, with the economy contracting by 3.5% in 2020, recovering to pre-crisis levels by 2022.
Beyond 2020, these trends reverse. Growth in the mainland economy will recover more substantially from 2021 onwards as economic life returns to normal after the circulation of a vaccine and as the risk of a reimposition of controls abates. Household spending and external trade will recover quickly as consumer behaviour (both domestic and abroad) normalises. Whereas the export-oriented oil and gas sector will be especially damaged by the outbreak. Demand for both gas and oil globally is strongly pro-cyclical and Norway's entrenched exposure to markets that will be slow to recover from the crisis implies a substantial weakening of oil sector growth. Although firms within Norway's oil sector (especially Equinor, the state-backed oil firm) remain far from insolvency, real exports and the outlook for investment in the sector have worsened significantly.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation The pandemic and consequent lockdown has weighed on consumer prices, with the collapse in energy prices and demand for non-essential goods pulling down price growth. Headline inflation initially fell from 1.8% in January to 0.7% in March. Nevertheless, now that restrictions are being lifted, inflation has started to pick up pace again, rising to 1.4% in July. Rising core inflation, owing to an uptick in food prices, which was over 2.6% in July, will erode consumer purchasing power.
Overall, we expect that the disruptive effects of the coronavirus on consumer demand and oil prices will drag down inflation in 2020, to an average of 1.2%. This trend will be supported by an easing in household stockpiling as controls on social distancing abated, and as the fall in oil prices (which we expect to average US$42.3/barrel this year) ripples through the economy. The recent appreciation of the currency should also curtail inflation. A stronger than expected recovery in consumer spending continues to pose upside risks for price growth.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates The krone has largely followed the substantial changes in global energy markets since January. Between end-2019 and end-June, it depreciated by roughly 3.7% on a trade-weighted basis, as the price of oil has collapsed from US$65/b to US$44.7/b and economic activity has slowed.
Although the krone has strengthened from its nadir in March (when it had depreciated by over 17% from December), conditions of subdued demand and slower growth are likely to prevent the krone from fully returning to its December value until 2024, when oil prices have recovered, and production is restored. Further downward shocks to oil prices, chiefly from shocks to global demand, remain a risk to our exchange-rate forecast.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector Norway's current-account surpluses are structurally supported by large inflows on the trade and primary income accounts, respectively reflecting the economy's position as a major oil exporter and the size of the GPFG.
Although inflows in both of these components will be damaged by the economic fallout from the coronavirus, we do not expect either of these accounts to fall into deficit. Oil exports will be damaged by the collapse in oil demand, but we expect that this will be balanced by the reduction in goods imports, keeping the trade balance in surplus despite the fall in oil prices.
As the coronavirus abates, steady rises in oil prices from 2021 onwards will further support the trade balance, and increases in production (barring any government intervention) will continue throughout the forecast period. We expect that this, combined with a revival of growth in major trading partners (particularly Germany), will support a rise in the current-account surplus over the forecast period, to 6.5% of GDP in 2024.

Full text: - Egypt's political sphere will remain tightly controlled during the forecast period, reflecting the government's wariness of dissent in the delicate security and economic environment. Nevertheless, the president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, will maintain internal stability during his second term, which has been extended to 2024 (with the possibility of serving a third term until 2030) as part of constitutional amendments made in 2019. All forms of protest activity will continue to be heavily suppressed, with the government concerned that the economic fallout from the global coronavirus pandemic could spark renewed unrest. The security forces will face persistent challenges from armed Islamist groups, both in northern Sinai, as part of an ongoing insurgency, and also in the form of sporadic terrorist incidents elsewhere in the country. The conflict in Libya and tensions with Turkey will be key strategic concerns.

- Egypt's business environment score improves in the forecast period, with its regional and global rankings rising by seven and two places, respectively, owing largely to greater economic resilience to the coronavirus pandemic than some other economies, owing to previous reforms and substantial external support. Investment and licensing reforms are helping to ease crippling levels of red tape and to boost incentives for private enterprise. Consequently, there is a leap in the score for policy towards private enterprise and competition. Nonetheless, progress will be slow in certain areas owing to resistance from vested interest groups in the government and military.

- The government has successfully sought out help from multilateral agencies to provide support through the pandemic crisis, including a renewed IMF programme, but the economic fallout of the coronavirus on economic activity and jobs will still be large, and fiscal adjustment will stall initially. Economic reform will remain focused on fiscal and structural deficiencies, with a view to consolidating the state finances, shoring up foreign reserves and enhancing the business environment in the long term. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the fiscal and current-account deficits to narrow again from 2021, albeit slowly. Inflation is now returning to single digits. Following the worst of the pandemic, macroeconomic stability will be achieved slowly, spreading to the private sector only gradually, owing to weak institutional capacity.

- Egypt, which remains the most populous state in the Middle East, will experience an increase in its working-age population in 2020-24. This will present both a demographic opportunity, owing to the presence of a sizeable, youthful workforce, and a demographic challenge if unemployment continues to rise for an extended period after the pandemic (not our central forecast). The pandemic has resulted in the return of large numbers of the estimated 5m Egyptians working in Gulf Arab states. The role of the Gulf in absorbing surplus Egyptian labour is likely to diminish in 2020-21 but will reabsorb some workers again later in the forecast period. Egypt is highly urbanised, with nearly one-tenth of the population living in Cairo.

- In population terms, Egypt boasts the largest consumer market in the Middle East and North Africa. However, the potential of this market will be severely constrained in the first half of the forecast period by the immediate fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and weak purchasing power, reflecting low wage growth, with consumers wary of spending amid subsidy reform and recent economic instability. GDP per head figures mask deep income disparities between the rich and the poor, with most of the population in the latter category. Nevertheless, per-capita income will begin to pick up again in 2021-22, including in US dollar terms as the local currency appreciates.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.

- Egypt has started to address long-standing market distortions, and there is significant potential for strong real economic growth in the long term. However, success will also depend on a commitment to structural reform, as well as on major improvements to institutional effectiveness. We forecast that real GDP growth will average 4.2% a year in 2020-30 and 4.3% in 2020-50, with labour productivity growth being a significant contributor.

Background: In 1952 an army coup brought an end to the monarchy in Egypt. Two years later, Gamal Abdel Nasser, a former military officer, led the country (1954-70) and introduced nationalist policies. Under his successor as president, Anwar Sadat (1970-81), Egypt's political stance shifted towards the West and its economic policies became more liberal. Mr Sadat's signing in 1979 of a peace treaty with Israel eventually led to his assassination and the appointment of his deputy, Hosni Mubarak, as president in 1981. However, Mr Mubarak grew increasingly unpopular among Egyptians as official corruption became rampant during his three-decade tenure, and a popular uprising, backed by the military, forced his resignation in early 2011. The Muslim Brotherhood, which had been banned since 1954, won the parliamentary and presidential elections in 2012; however, in the wake of mass protests, it was ousted by the military in July 2013, and the former army chief, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, was elected president in a landslide victory in 2014 and was re-elected in 2018.
Political structure: Egypt's semi-presidential system is based on the 2014 constitution, which granted parliament wider powers, including the right to withdraw confidence from the president. However, the current parliament-elected in late 2015-lacks an effective opposition bloc. In April 2019 the constitution was amended to extend the presidential term and strengthen the powers of the office-including over parliament, the judiciary and the military. Cabinet ministers are often subjected to scrutiny, which can result in their dismissal and, in some cases, court action.
Policy issues: Weak institutional capacity and opposition from vested interests often prevent economic reforms. Nonetheless, the Sisi regime is keen to enhance the business environment and consolidate the public finances through fiscal reforms, although reform capacity will be curtailed by the need to deal with the coronavirus outbreak.
Taxation: After multiple revisions, a presidential decree was passed in August 2015, reducing the top tax rate on companies and individuals from 25% to 22.5% on incomes of E£200,000 (US$22,523 at the pre-flotation official rate) or above. The decree also suspended a 10% capital gains tax for two years, to boost competitiveness. However, it retained a 10% tax on stock dividends. Value-added tax (VAT) of 13% was approved by parliament in August 2016 and raised to 14% in 2017/18.
Foreign trade: Egypt has a large structural trade deficit. Despite declining hydrocarbons output, oil and gas remain the country's leading export earners. Suez Canal transit fees provide about US$5bn a year in foreign-currency inflows, and the current account fluctuates between modest deficits and surpluses.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Present government: The president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, won a second four-year term in March 2018; the present government took office in June that year, with Mustafa Madbouly replacing Sherif Ismail as prime minister. The only significant change during the first year of Mr Sisi's second term was the replacement of the transport minister following a train disaster in February 2019. A reshuffle at the end of 2019 included the abolition of the Ministry of Investment, whose head, Sahar Nasr, left the government. Her role as international co-operation minister was taken over by Rania Mashaat, the former tourism minister, while the prime minister's office assumed oversight of investment. Domestic policy will remain largely focused on economic and social reform, but in the context of tightly controlled political process. Among the key ministers are the finance minister, Mohamed Maait, the foreign affairs minister, Sameh Shoukry, and the planning and economic development minister, Hala Zayid. The health and population minister, Hala Zayid, has also taken a central role in directing the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic.
The cabinet is largely technocratic in nature, which partly reflects the embryonic status of most political parties in Egypt and Mr Sisi's desire to contain alternative power bases. This may also reflect Mr Sisi's desire to remain neutral towards all political forces that are currently represented in parliament. Many cabinet ministers are Western-educated, and most are private-sector veterans without affiliations to political parties. The president has taken steps to boost the representation of Copts and women in the cabinet; following the end-2019 reshuffle, there are eight women ministers. Although former members of the now defunct National Democratic Party are rarely selected for ministerial posts, many of the lower-ranking officials in the government served under the ousted regime of Hosni Mubarak (1981-2011).
The armed forces and their various affiliates have assumed an increasingly important role in the economy during Mr Sisi's rule, and particularly in infrastructure projects. This trend is likely to be reinforced during the forecast period. One of the most important figures in the cabinet is the new transport minister, Kamel el-Wazir, who was head of the Egyptian Armed Forces Engineering Agency before his appointment in March 2019. Mr el-Wazir has been given a mandate to effect a major upgrade to the railway system.
Parliamentary forces: The complexion of parliament is set to change following elections to be held in late 2020, with Future of the Homeland, a relatively new party formed by pro-Sisi activists, set to establish a strong majority. The first election for a restored upper house, the Senate, took place in August 2020. This chamber had been abolished in 2013 after Mr Sisi, then commander of the army, effected the removal of Mohamed Morsi from the presidency. It has been restored as part of a set of constitutional amendments that were passed in early 2019. The ostensible reason was to provide an extra layer of parliamentary scrutiny, but, given that 100 of its 300 members are appointed by the president, it also provides a means for Mr Sisi to tighten his control over the legislature. The Senate election followed a change to the voting system that gave more scope to the larger parties to form strong blocs. One-half of the elected seats were decided on the basis of closed party lists, with the remainder based on individual constituency candidates. A 15-party bloc led by Future of the Homeland won the list allocation unopposed, and Future of the Homeland also won more than two-thirds of the individually contested seats on a turnout of just 14% of eligible voters. In the previous lower house election in 2015, the split between lists and individuals was 20% to 80%, with the result that the majority of the members were nominally independent, although they coalesced into a dominant pro-Sisi bloc named Support Egypt. The second largest party in the Senate is the People's Republic Party, formed by Ahmed Abu Hashima, an industrialist who had earlier provided financial backing for Future of the Homeland. The election to the lower house (which has 596 seats, including 28 appointed by the president) will take place towards the end of 2020, using the same 50:50 list:individual system as in the Senate election. Future of the Homeland is likely to be the largest party, and it could well win an outright majority.
Political outlook: Political stability The president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, will remain in power throughout the 2020-24 forecast period. Constitutional changes made in 2019 extend his current, second term from four to six years, to 2024. The changes also allow him to stand for a further six-year term, to 2030, and tighten his control over other branches of government, as well as expanding the role of the military. Mr Sisi will continue to tighten his grip on power. However, the centralisation of the president's authority poses increasing risks to political stability at a time of growing socioeconomic uncertainty following the global coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. The government has stifled critics of its pandemic response and will also suppress dissent on other issues. In parallel, it will attempt to defuse social unrest triggered by economic hardship with supportive measures. Subsequent fiscal tightening is a potential trigger for street protests. However, the authorities will crack down hard before any unrest can gather enough momentum to threaten the regime.
A combination of effective deployment by Mr Sisi's security apparatus, increased state largesse to the poorest Egyptians and public distaste for further instability is likely to keep such pressures contained for most of the forecast period, but continued political repression could fundamentally undermine Mr Sisi's rule beyond 2024.
In the long term domestic policies will focus on economic development, particularly in the still-restive Sinai and other deprived areas, and security. Mr Sisi, formerly the head of the armed forces, will exert tight control over internal security and will continue to crack down on Islamist militants. However, sporadic incidents of militancy will occur, with the risks increasing as economic development strategies fail to improve conditions for many pandemic-affected Egyptians. Mr Sisi could lose the loyalty of the armed forces and his position in such circumstances.
Parliament is subservient to Mr Sisi and will be further kept in check by presidential appointees to the new Senate (the upper house) and by the tight controls imposed on candidates who do stand for election. The most active opposition to the government remains Sinai-based jihadi groups, as well as the deposed Muslim Brotherhood-support for which has ebbed-and its militant offshoots, Hassm and Liwa al-Thawra. A sweeping anti-terrorism offensive launched in 2018 has eased security threats. Although militant groups will sporadically carry out attacks, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the military operation to help to contain the number and size of attacks.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Egypt's bureaucracy is arguably the largest in the region-and among the most bloated globally-with nearly 6m workers employed by the central government, according to official data. (This excludes around 3m additional workers who are employed by the state on temporary contracts.) As a result, low efficiency is particularly endemic in the government sector. This over-staffing has placed a heavy burden on the public finances and left few funds for improving public services and upgrading systems. Domestic reform is sometimes held back by the populist bent of the parliament, although it has co-operated strongly with the state on a raft of austerity measures that have helped to unlock significant multilateral financial support, notably from the IMF, which in 2020 agreed to provide US$8bn in loans to help the government to deal with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, supplementing the US$12bn disbursed in 2016-19 in the form of an extended fund facility.
Mr Sisi has professed his determination to make the government more efficient and to crack down on corruption. In the 2019 Corruption Perceptions Index compiled by Transparency International, Egypt was ranked 106th out of the 180 countries surveyed, with the same score as Algeria, Brazil and Côte d'Ivoire. The agency tasked with combating corruption is the Administrative Control Authority. This body is closely tied to the presidency, and, according to a law passed in 2017, its scope is restricted to the civilian bureaucracy, which means that there is no institutional structure for scrutinising the expanding role of the military establishment and the intelligence services in the economy.
The prerogatives of the military were strengthened in the constitutional amendments that were approved in April 2019. These amendments also reinforced the presidency's control over the judiciary (and over military appointments). The tightening of restrictions on public expression has also hit civil society organisations, which are heavily constrained. The increasing centralisation of power within the presidential office and among senior military and intelligence figures is likely to yield some improvements in the efficiency of government operations, but at the expense of accountability and at the risk of fostering corruption within these privileged echelons of the state.
Another important development during the forecast period will be the transfer of government operations from Cairo to the new administrative capital, to the east. Ministries were scheduled to commence this process during 2020. The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a delay to this schedule, but the government has indicated that the relocation of ministries will go ahead in 2021. The move provides an opportunity to streamline government operations through having a dedicated zone for them, with modern infrastructure and information technology services. However, there will inevitably be some disruption during the transfer.
Political outlook: Election watch Elections will be a means for Mr Sisi to consolidate power rather than a democratic exercise. This carries a risk of sudden and volatile regime change, albeit well beyond the forecast period. Elections will not be free or fair, with candidates almost exclusively from government-allied blocs. Voter turnout for the newly reconstituted partly elected Senate vote was exceptionally low, at 14%. The government has threatened to prosecute eligible voters who did not vote, which is likely to push up turnout in the parliamentary vote for the lower house (House of Representatives) in October-November, but the outcome is not in doubt regardless. Future of the Homeland, a dominant pro-Sisi party, is likely to be the favoured conduit for government policies. Constitutional changes have extended Mr Sisi's rule to 2024, when he can stand again. Mr Sisi, who appears to be in relatively good health, is therefore likely to remain in power until 2030. Repeatedly delayed municipal elections are unlikely to be held before 2021. Local polls are important for businesses, as municipal councils implement investment regulations at the local level.
Political outlook: International relations The government's priorities will centre on maintaining cordial ties with the US, strengthening defence capabilities and building a broadening range of international links to secure its strategic interests and access to financial support. Regionally, the government will cultivate strong political ties to seek to secure maximum economic backing from the Gulf Arab states.
Egypt will continue its engagement in Libya and build on security ties in the Gulf and eastern Mediterranean in a bid to curb the growing influence of its regional rival, Turkey, which it views as posing a threat to its energy interests through its military support for the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in western Libya. Egypt will also seek to limit threats from Islamist militancy emanating from Libya. Egypt will direct political and military support to groups allied with the GNA's rival government in eastern Libya but is unlikely to risk direct and sustained military engagement there.
Egypt will lean on the Gulf Arab states for economic support in the wake of the pandemic and co-ordinate on key international issues, including the ongoing boycott of Qatar to retain the backing of the UAE and Saudi Arabia in particular, although it will still seek Qatari investment. Egypt, the UAE and Saudi Arabia will step up joint efforts against security threats in the region.
Europe will also be an important source of military hardware, spending on which will remain a priority in the context of Egypt's security campaigns and geopolitical tensions in the gas-rich eastern Mediterranean region, where the country is taking an increasingly central role in hydrocarbons development. Egypt will seek to deter incursions by Turkey, which does not recognise the 2003 maritime border demarcation agreement between Egypt and Cyprus. Co-ordination with Israel over natural gas and shared security interests will continue.
The filling of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam by Ethiopia, which began in mid-July, will constrain the flow of water from the Blue Nile to Egypt. Various regional and international mediators will seek an agreement that addresses Egyptian and Sudanese concerns over flow rates, but tensions will remain high, although we do not expect an escalation into military confrontation. Ethiopia may agree to modest slowdowns in fill rates during drought periods, but Egypt is unlikely to secure greater concessions.

Policy reforms will continue in a bid to cement earlier gains despite pandemic Egypt's overall score improves in the forecast period (2020-24), and its regional and global rankings rise by two and seven places, respectively, owing to more effective government and continued efforts to enhance the business environment as part of reforms that have been undertaken with the support of the IMF and the World Bank. Egypt's economic prospects have been severely curtailed by the global coronavirus pandemic, but its chances of a recovery have been bolstered by the improvements made to the fiscal position and institutional framework in the previous three years, which means that its macroeconomic environment score shows the strongest improvement in any category in 2020-24, and its regional and global rankings improve markedly from their bottom rankings in 2015-19. Structural reforms will include efforts to upgrade the education system to better meet employment needs.
Egypt's score for taxation improves marginally but its ranking slips globally in 2020-24 as fiscal pressures mount. The Ministry of Finance is proceeding with plans to achieve full digitisation of its tax accounts, which should improve the efficiency of tax affairs and provide greater transparency. Value-added tax (VAT) was introduced in mid-2016. Stamp duty on share transactions was introduced in July, now delayed from 2020 to 2022 as part of a package of measures to mitigate the impact of coronavirus; stamp duty rates have been cut, and the tax rate on dividends from listed companies has been halved to 5%. Investors are entitled to income tax discounts. A new customs law, passed in August 2020, provides for electronic clearance of goods, helping to streamline trade and logistics. The restoration of such tax incentives, which were withdrawn in 2005, will improve Egypt's competitiveness in relation to other regional investment destinations. Access to finance will be much improved beyond the pandemic period, as companies will have much less difficulty in securing foreign exchange, and the increase in the government's external borrowing will free up more domestic bank liquidity for lending to the private sector.

Business environment outlook: Egypt's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: Regulations eased to support private businesses during pandemic. Public-private partnerships are encouraged.
2022-24: Military-run enterprises are encouraged to list on the stockmarket. Share offerings from state entities resume, including remaining shares in banks. The National Bank of Egypt is kept in full public ownership.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: The government actively courts foreign investment and improves tax breaks to keep foreign partners in Egypt, but conditions will remain tough, given weakening global economic sentiment during the pandemic.
2022-24: The investment law is amended following complaints from foreign firms about delays and bureaucratic obstacles.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: Capital controls intermittently reinstated to manage pandemic pressures. The government introduces measures to reduce red tape and import costs with new customs regulations.

Taxes 2020-21: Some sectors get waivers on certain tax payments during the pandemic crisis. Measures to ease the tax burden on financial markets introduced. Tax incentives and exemptions for the private sector improved. Employees face 1% tax surcharge on income for 2020/21.
2022-24: Corporate income tax is lowered from 22.5%, but the value-added tax (VAT) rate is increased. Capital gains tax is finally introduced in 2022, after numerous postponements. Stamp duty on share transactions is raised.
Financing 2020-21: Lending to the private sector curtailed by global pandemic aftershocks, despite increased government incentives.
2022-24: Domestic credit conditions improve despite a small rise in policy rates. Foreign banks increase their direct lending to Egyptian projects, and leading Egyptian banks receive enhanced ratings from international agencies.
The labour market 2020-21: The official unemployment rate surges amid an economic downturn, although workers push for wage increases to compensate for the erosion of real wages since 2016.
2022-24: Unemployment trends down again. Trade unions resist pension reforms raising the retirement age to 65.

Reforms of 2016-19 have helped build some resilience during the crisis The macroeconomic category has strengthened markedly and despite the global pandemic will see the biggest improvement in the forecast period. This reflects improvements in most key indicators as a result of reforms enacted since 2016, although consumer demand had been slower to recover, as high inflation dampened household consumption, and public debt has been rising. Egypt's short-term economic prospects have been clouded by the impact of the coronavirus, with tourism and remittances among the worst-hit. Increased external borrowing has helped to mitigate the immediate balance-of-payments risks, but it has also aggravated the medium-term risk of a debt-service crunch. Real GDP growth will return to the previous trend of 5-6% later in the forecast period. Inflation is likely to remain subdued, and the exchange rate appears set for a period of stability. Since 2017/18 the government has achieved primary fiscal surpluses and expects to do so even during the pandemic crisis, as it seeks to achieve a medium-term target of lowering public debt below 80% of GDP.
High repayment obligations could put external finances at risk later in forecast period The flotation of the currency at the end of 2016 was a shock to the country's financial system, but it has contributed to a turnaround in Egypt's balance-of-payments position. The inflow of capital in the form of loans from international institutions, sovereign bond issues and a revival in direct and indirect foreign investment has enabled the central bank to rebuild its foreign-exchange reserves to a comfortable level, and to relax capital controls. Reserves fell sharply between February and May 2020 amid a reversal of portfolio investment, but they have since stabilised, owing to external borrowing and a resumption of inward portfolio investment. Reserves could come under pressure later in the forecast period, when substantial debt repayments fall due.

Egypt's policy towards private enterprise and competition will improve considerably over the forecast period as the government seeks to streamline the regulatory system for investment and licensing. The country's global and regional ranks both rise as a result. However, private businesses-already hurt by the impact of the global pandemic on economic activity-will have to contend with the continued deep involvement of the armed forces and their various commercial arms in a wide range of economic sectors. The army frequently acts in the guise of a regulatory agency itself, by requiring permission for firms to operate in areas deemed to have a national security dimension, and military companies often compete with civilian firms, but with the advantage of being able to use cheap military assets, including land and labour. Efforts to promote private investment stretch back decades, but businesses still encounter obstacles arising from inconsistencies in the legislation and inefficiency and corruption in the bureaucracy. Recent reforms to the licensing and investment laws are likely to result in some improvements, depending on implementation.

- Law 15 on industrial licensing and Law 72 on investment, both passed in 2017, aspire to speed up the approval processes for private companies carrying out new projects and to enhance the authority of the quasi-autonomous agencies operating under the law: the Industrial Development Agency and the General Authority for Investment.

Legislation to encourage both new and existing projects will aim to attract investment
- A revision in 2019 to Law 72 now enables the expansion of existing investment projects to qualify for incentives (previously only open for new investment). The incentives include corporate tax discounts of 50% for projects in designated priority areas and 30% for projects in other areas. Another adjustment specifies that the fee for certifying signatures for contracts to set up a new project should be 0.25% of the paid-up capital, with an upper limit of E£10,000 (US$570; there was no upper limit previously).
- The establishment at the end of 2015 of SCZone, an agency responsible for the Suez Canal Economic Zone, was also intended as a signal to private business that the government was serious about creating a more user-friendly regulatory environment, but it has since become more closely tied to the state sector and the armed forces. However, changes to the leadership of the Suez Canal Authority, the public-sector agency in charge of overseeing the canal, has paved the way for the agency responsible for economic development in the canal zone to regain some autonomy, although it remains close to the military.
- The government has previously sought to assist domestic steel and cotton producers in the face of global pressures. Despite changes to reform competition policy, loopholes and other impediments to competition remain in certain sectors, such as telecommunications and utilities, and corruption is still a problem, especially at local government level.

Despite intermittent market pressure, reforms will stay in place Egypt's score for its foreign investment policies improves markedly for the forecast period, and its global and regional rankings rise by 18 and five places, respectively, to 48th and sixth. The government is actively courting foreign investment through revamping the regulatory framework, including the restoration of tax incentives, and through the intensive promotion of new project proposals and zones. Foreign investors have also been encouraged by the reforms to the exchange-rate system, which have helped to ease blockages in access to foreign exchange needed to finance imports of equipment and materials and to allow for repatriation of dividends. Inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) have increased steadily over the past few years, reaching US$9bn in 2019 but fell sharply in the first quarter of 2020, in an early indication of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. We do not expect FDI inflows to regain their recent levels until 2022, at the earliest.

- The new investment law of 2017 and the subsequent amendments in 2019 have given new powers to the General Authority for Investment, with the provision for electronic approval of project proposals. The main issues the new law has sought to address are inconsistencies in the approval process and the demand from investors for the restoration of tax incentives, which were removed in 2005 on the grounds that they led to manipulative behaviour by businesses and that they deprived the Treasury of revenue.
- The efficacy of a new investments approval system will be tested by the pandemic, given its dampening effect on global demand and financial flows. Businesses setting up new projects or expanding existing ones will be entitled to claim discounts of 30-50% on their tax bills, up to the equivalent of 85% of their paid-in capital. The higher discounts will be available for projects established in areas classified as deprived and for labour-intensive projects. The new law also allows for the creation of new special investment zones.

New legislation allows foreign acquisitions to be included in FDI figures
- The investment law was amended in 2019 to enable extensions to existing projects and the development of new product lines to benefit from tax exemptions. The amendments also included changes to the accounting system for FDI, through giving the General Authority for Investment full authority to record inflows. The definition of FDI has been broadened to reflect international practices, including allowing foreign acquisitions of stakes of less than 10% in Egyptian entities to be recorded as FDI. Foreign oil companies will be able to retain profits for reinvestment. Regularising the recording of flows will improve transparency, making for a more amenable FDI environment. The government has provided assurances that the investment law will bring an end to conflicts with the industrial licensing law, which also includes a streamlined approvals process. It remains doubtful whether such conflicts can be avoided in practice
- At the end of 2019 the post of investment minister was abolished, with responsibility for this area of policy shifting to the office of the prime minister. The government said that this would help to streamline investment policy implementation. The General Authority for Investment is the executive agency for investment, and now reports directly to the prime minister.

Foreign trade and exchange controls will remain lifted but government will be wary of further measures Egypt's score in this category improves, but its global rank falls by one place, and its regional rank is unchanged. This reflects the stabilisation of the foreign-exchange market amid more challenging global conditions following a period of improvement that has been underpinned by heavy external borrowing. Since 1994 there have been no explicit exchange controls in Egypt. Egypt has also accepted the obligations of sections 2, 3 and 4 of Article VIII of the IMF's Articles of Agreement. These oblige the authorities to refrain from imposing any restrictions on payments and transfers for current-account transactions or from engaging in discriminatory currency arrangements or multiple-currency practices without the IMF's approval. Nevertheless, the authorities did impose a series of restrictions on foreign-exchange transfers after the rapid depletion of net international reserves in the wake of the 2011 revolution, and companies found it increasingly difficult to secure access to foreign exchange to finance imports and for the repatriation of dividends. The situation has improved dramatically following the flotation of the Egyptian pound in November 2016. Restrictions on cash deposits to finance imports were relaxed, and in June 2017 the central bank removed limits placed in 2011 and only partly relaxed in 2014 on banks providing clients with foreign currency to transfer abroad (previously limited to one transfer per year of up to US$100,000 per client).

- Net international fell by almost US$10bn between February and May 2020 as a result of heavy withdrawals by portfolio investors in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Equilibrium was restored after the government signed two agreements with the IMF, worth US$8bn in total, and secured US$5bn through a sovereign bond issue. This has prompted a cautious return of portfolio investors. However, high external debt repayment obligations could put intermittent pressure on the external finances.
- The exchange-rate system is now operated by commercial banks, with the central bank playing no formal role in the market. The exchange rate depreciated in 2017-18 amid heavy divestment by portfolio investors. However, the Egyptian pound appreciated strongly in 2019 in response to renewed portfolio inflows, and it reached E£16.00:US$1 in early 2020. The rate depreciated by about 3% in May-June 2020, but had rallied to E£15.80:US$1 by early September. Recent multilateral and other external funding inflows and growing hydrocarbons prospects should support a stronger currency for most of 2020-24.
- The government and the central bank have taken steps to avert a balance of payments crisis arising from the pandemic. The strong relationship formed with the IMF during the US$12bn extended fund facility (EFF) programme in 2016-19 has helped Egypt to mobilise a further US$8bn from the IMF for 2020-21; US$5bn has been raised from the bond market in 2020, and a further US$2bn from a group of regional and international banks, stabilising the foreign-exchange market. However, there remains a risk that pressure on the currency will mount, once the government starts repayments of the EFF in late 2021.

Tax policy will keep most gains but an element of unpredictability remains
- Tax policy is likely to stabilise during the forecast period, although the scale of change will not be at the rate seen in the historical period. Egypt's global ranking falls by 12 places, but its regional ranking improves by one place to eighth. The basic rate of income tax for companies was lowered to 22.5% from 25% in 2015. The business community, which is strongly represented in parliament, has lobbied for a return to a 20% rate (in pace in 2004-11) but the need for fiscal adjustment after the pandemic is likely to preclude such a move. Collection of corporate tax will improve following the ongoing digitisation of the system. Tax discounts introduced in reforms to the investment law in 2017 and 2019 will remain in place. New legislation in July 2020 will enable companies to submit unified tax declarations, including income tax, VAT and stamp duties in a single package. The government might increase the VAT rate from 14% to 15% to derive more tax revenue as it tries to restore the fiscal finances after the pandemic. Withholding tax is likely to remain at 20%. Following the flotation of the local currency, international banks resumed investments in Egyptian Treasury bills as the high returns and reduced foreign-exchange risk offset reservations about the withholding tax. These flows have fluctuated in line with global market sentiment, with a renewed outflow in early 2020, but inward flows have resumed.
- As part of the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the government sought to stimulate the capital market through a range of tax measures. These included a further two-year deferral of the introduction of a 10% capital gains tax to May 2022. The government has also halved the dividend tax to 5% and reduced stamp duty on shares. However, a 1% emergency surcharge is being levied on salaries to help to cover extra spending associated with the pandemic.

The government has adjusted personal income tax thresholds
- Changes to personal income tax in the 2020/21 budget, include increases to thresholds, reflecting the impact of high inflation in 2016-18. The threshold for paying the lowest tax rate of 2.5% has been raised to annual earnings of E£15,000 (US$940) from E£8,000, and the rates charged for the next two bands have been lowered by 5 percentage points to 10% (for E£30,000-45,000) and to 15% (E£45,000-60,000). The rate for the E£60,000-200,000 band has been lowered to 20% from 22.5% but for earnings of E£200,000-400,000 it has been left at 22.5%. A new top rate of 25% will be applied to earnings above E£400,000.
- A new property tax law passed in 2014/15 has, since 2017/18, charged 10% tax on properties with a market value of E£2m (US$125,000) or more. There are exemptions for facilities and property owned by the armed forces. Valuations are to be reassessed every five years, but this has been postponed, owing to delays in tax collection. The pandemic is likely to lead to further deferral.

Confidence in the financial system has strenghtened although the pandemic will test its limits The turnaround in Egypt's balance of payments that followed the signing of a its US$12bn EFF with the IMF in 2016 has helped to anchor the economy during the pandemic crisis, allowing a dramatic improvement in the score and ranking for the country in the financing category. The global rank rises 20 places to 50th. The regional rank moves up to eighth place from 12th. The increased confidence in the international financial system in Egypt has been reflected in the series of successful sovereign debt issues undertaken by the finance ministry since January 2017, which have raised more than US$25bn, includingf US$5bn in May 2020. The Ministry of Finance also raised US$2bn in a package of conventional and Islamic loans signed with a UAE-led group of banks in September 2020 and two loan agreements worth US$8bn in total with the IMF in May and June. This borrowing is mainly directed at fiscal financing, but it has also helped to stabilise the balance of payments. The shift to external deficit financing will make more liquidity available in the banking system for lending to the private sector later in the forecast period. However, investors and creditors will have to consider the future risk of the large increase in Egypt's stock of external debt.
Looser monetary policy should allow greater private-sector borrowing
- Lending to the private sector will grow as the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) loosens monetary policy and seeks to promote lending as part of the broader effort to stimulate economic recovery from the coronavirus shock. A surge in inflation in late 2016 prompted the CBE to raise interest rates by 700 basis points, bringing its main operation rate to 19.25% by July 2017. Inflation started to ease at the end of 2017, and the CBE cut rates in 2018-19 by a total of 650 basis points. In March 2020, in response to the pandemic crisis, the central bank cut policy rates by 300 basis points, to 9.75%. High real interest rates help to attract foreign inflows into Treasury bills, but hampers private-sector borrowing, and there is scope for further rate cuts if inflation remains subdued.
- The central bank has launched a series of schemes aimed at directing credit towards specific sectors. The first, in 2016, set a target for banks to allocate at least 20% of the loan portfolio to micro, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The interest rate was set at below market rates, and banks could offset the difference by reducing their statutory reserve. The scheme was extended to medium- and large-sized companies (with annual turnover of between E£50m and E£1bn) in late 2019, with the allocation ofE£100bn to be lent at 8% annual interest. In March-April 2020 the central bank took further measures to alleviate the burden on borrowers of the coronavirus. SMEs and household debtors were given a six-month waiver on debt-servicing, and a similar provision was made for companies in the tourism sector. The central bank also abolished the upper limit for preferential borrowing by medium- and large-sized firms.

Central banks provide guarantees to ease credit difficulties
- In May 2020 the central bank pledged E£100bn (US$6.3bn) in guarantees for subsidised loans to be provided by commercial banks to industrial, agricultural and contracting firms in order to provide assurance to banks at a time of elevated risk, owing to the coronavirus pandemic. This would provide an incentive for banks to continue to advance credit to businesses in order to help them to remain solvent and to retain their workforce during the downturn.
- According to the CBE, non-performing loans (NPLs) accounted for 4.1% of total loans in May 2020, compared with 7.1% of total loans in 2015. However, this improvement in loan quality has come about partly because of the preference of banks to lend to the government rather than to private businesses. The government currently accounts for 66% of total bank credit, compared with 21% for the private business sector, according to the central bank. As lending to business revives, we expect that the NPL ratio will also increase, albeit modestly.
- The stockmarket attracted strong inflows of foreign portfolio investment following the flotation of the pound, but there has been a slowdown in 2020 amid wider concerns among international investors about emerging-market risk. The EGX30 index fell by about one-third in the first quarter of 2020, before staging a modest recovery. At end-August 2020 the index was still about 20% below its level at the start of the year. The market had been preparing for a series of offerings of state-owned shares in more than 20 companies. This process has already been subject to delays, but the first offerings could take place in 2021.

Minimum capital requirements are rising for banks
- A new law approved in July 2020 increases the minimum capital requirement for commercial banks tenfold to E£5bn (US$300m). Foreign branches will be required to increase their capital to at least US$150m (currently US$50m). Banks will be given three years to comply. The new capital levels have been set with a view to complying with Basel III and Basel IV regulations, and to take account of devaluation since the previous level was set in 2003. Some smaller banks are likely to merge in order to comply with the new capital requirements. The law also has provisions for e-payments and fintech services.
- The Sovereign Wealth Fund of Egypt (Tharaa), which was set up in 2018 with authorised capital of E£200bn, is designed to provide a structure for increased private investment in Egypt. State assets will be transferred to the fund to form the basis of partnerships with private investors.

The labour market score and ranking rise modestly for the forecast period, reflecting improved economic performance and management since 2016. From a business perspective, the Egyptian labour market offers an abundance of young workers, with graduates, post-graduates and skilled and semi-skilled technicians available at very competitive rates. The return of Egyptian workers from the Gulf as a result of lay-offs of expatriates during the coronavirus pandemic will also add to the pool of experienced labour within Egypt. There are several drawbacks, however, notably the rigidity of labour market laws-which are set to become more restrictive-and regulations that make it difficult to fire workers (partly because it is an extremely costly exercise). Employers face pressure from workers for pay increases to compensate for the fall in real wages and the rise in the poverty rate during the surge in inflation following the 2016 devaluation, although the rise in the unemployment rate as a result of the pandemic will weaken workers' bargaining power.
Unemployment is rising due to the pandemic's economic fallout
- After reaching almost 13% in 2016, the unemployment rate fell steadily over the next three years, reaching 7.7% at end-March 2020. The unemployment rate then rose sharply to 9.6% by end-June; about 2.6m jobs were lost during the second quarter of that year, as a result of a sharp drop in economic activity amid the coronavirus pandemic. Sectors that were hit particularly hard included retail, tourism and manufacturing. There was also a significant reduction in the workforce, arising mainly from the departure of women from the labour market. The labour participation rate fell to 38.9% from 42.7% by end-March 2020. Labour participation has fallen steadily from a peak of 49%, suggesting that many disaffected Egyptians are no longer searching for work. The government is continuing with major infrastructure projects, partly in a bid to sustain jobs through the pandemic, but the unemployment rate is only likely to fall from 2021.
- The government has sought to lessen the risk of labour unrest by announcing a significant increase in the minimum wage for all workers in the state sector, to E£2,000 (US$120) per month, with effect from July 2019. The minimum wage was previously increased to E£1,200 per month in 2014. The government also increased the basic state pension by E£150 per month to E£900. Proposed reforms to the pension system, entailing a gradual increase in the retirement age to 65 from 60 and a shift to a hybrid defined benefit/defined contribution scheme tied to average lifetime earnings, rather than final salary, could also prompt opposition from workers.

Focus on private-sector employment
- The government will try to shift the burden of creating jobs back to the private sector, once economic growth starts to recover. In 2018 it also launched education reforms tailored to improving the skills of the future labour force.

Government will seek to sustain growth with continued infrastructure spending Egypt's score for the quality of its infrastructure improves in 2020-24, with the global and regional rankings rising by eight and three places respectively. This reflects heavy ongoing investment in upgrading infrastructure, with a particular focus on energy and transportation, but large gaps remain. The military will take a leading role in many infrastructure projects, particularly for transport. The principal focus of the investment drive in recent years has been the energy sector. Between June 2014 and June 2018 installed electricity-generating capacity rose from 32 GW to 55 GW, including the start-up of three 4.8-GW combined-cycle plants built by Siemens (Germany). The power sector has also benefited from an improvement in natural gas supply, initially through imports of liquefied natural gas, and more recently owing to a rapid rise in domestic production. There is now a surplus of more than 20 GW of capacity over peak load.

- The Sovereign Wealth Fund of Egypt (Tharaa) will seek to establish itself as a major player in infrastructure by taking strategic stakes in existing assets to be transferred to the private sector, as well as in new projects. Its first major deal will entail the establishment of a partnership with an international developer to take over ownership and operation of the three Siemens power stations. The fund is also planning to take an anchor investment role in the installation of 1.4m cu metres/day of desalination capacity over the next five years.
- The contribution of renewable energy to total power capacity will increase over the forecast period, with the recent start-up of 1.5 GW of solar capacity developed under a feed-in tariff programme and the development of a series of large-scale wind farms and solar installations.
- Work will start during the forecast period on a 4.8-GW nuclear power station at El Dabaa, west of Alexandria. The project is to be carried out by Rosatom of Russia, including the supply of fuel and the disposal of waste.

The government is investing heavily in energy and transport infrastructure
- The completion of a new 72-km channel in the Suez Canal has improved services for international shipping. A new channel has also been dredged at the northern end of the canal to upgrade access to the East Port Said container terminal and to allow for its expansion. A second terminal is likely to be built, although contract negotiations for this have so far failed to progress.
- Major rail transport projects will make progress during the forecast period. These include a monorail system serving the new administrative capital and the new 6th of October City, for which a contract was signed in mid-2019. The government is also pressing ahead with upgrades to the existing rail system, which has a poor safety record. The government has invited bids for a railway linking Sokhna, on the Gulf of Suez, to the Mediterranean. Further sections of the Cairo metro will be completed during the forecast period, and the European Investment Bank agreed earlier in 2020 to finance work on upgrading the urban transport system in Alexandria. The road network will continue to be expanded under the supervision of the Egyptian Armed Forces Engineering Agency. These will include the completion of the Rod el-Farag axis across northern Cairo.

Egypt is playing catch-up with technological developments Egypt's technological readiness score will improve in the forecast period from a low base, on the back of innovation driven by both the government and private ventures. The country's global and regional rankings rise by three and two places respectively. The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology was established by the government in 1999 to support and promote a national information and communications technology (ICT) sector. The main areas of focus for the ministry are telecommunications, digital citizenship, human capacity, industry development and innovation. To date, progress has been slow, as indicated by Egypt's low (albeit improving) ranking in the World Intellectual Property Organisation's 2019 Global Innovation Index at 92nd out of 129 ranked countries. The main weakness for Egypt appears to be in ICT infrastructure, while slow progress is being made in institutional capacity and market sophistication, as well as business complexity.
The ICT sector is gaining increasing attention from the government
- The government envisages the technology sector as one of the main drivers of economic growth, including the development of new ICT investment clusters, such as a proposed technology valley in the Suez Canal Economic Zone.
- According to the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development, the telecommunications sector grew by 16% year on year in real terms in the first three quarters of 2019/20, following growth of 16.7% in the previous fiscal year, and the information sector grew by 3.8%. The telecommunications sector is also growing rapidly, with the roll-out of 4G and improved data provision helping to support growth in e-commerce and in the use of data services.
- The potential for growth in the technology sector has been highlighted by the success of Fawry, Egypt's leading fintech firm, whose market capitalisation reached US$1bn in August 2020, a year after its initial public offering. The shift to online shopping during the pandemic has boosted E-commerce.
- Egypt tested 5G mobile data during the Africa Cup of Nations in 2019, but a broader build-out will take some years, with those firms using hardware from the Chinese company, Huawei, likely to face political pressure from the US.

Economic forecast: Policy trends In the short term, policy will focus on addressing the coronavirus pandemic and maintaining access to international financing. Egypt made good progress in its 2016-19 US$12bn programme with the IMF. However, given the impact of the coronavirus on economic activity and the fiscal and external positions, Egypt has tapped the IMF again, accessing US$2.8bn from the Fund's coronavirus rapid financing initiative in May to help it cope with the pandemic's economic fallout. Egypt and the IMF have also agreed a 12-month, US$5.2bn stand-by arrangement (SBA), with the first tranche of US$2bn disbursed by early July. Several other multilateral agencies will also disburse lending to Egypt to see it through the pandemic crisis, including funding to support small and medium-sized enterprises and to sustain infrastructure projects.
The government allocated E£100bn (US$6.4bn) to its initial mitigation strategy, which included regulatory, fiscal and monetary measures, and strengthened credit guarantees to banks, but more funds will be deployed to support tourism and other high-priority areas that are likely to remain particularly badly affected by the pandemic. Nonetheless, the depth of the pandemic crisis will prove challenging for the private sector, and the government's capacity to provide further relief will be tested. It has taken measures to lower costs for portfolio investors and improve the attractiveness of capital markets, halving the dividend tax and pushing back the introduction of capital gains tax to May 2022, and foreign investors will be exempt. In a move to support manufacturing, electricity prices for energy-intensive industries have been cut and tariffs for other industries have been frozen, including for natural gas supplies. A new law rationalising customs regulations and processes came into force in mid-2020. Firms will also receive tax payment and declaration waivers and deferments. Although these measures will ease the financial burden for firms, the government will also need to offset the impact of its support on the public finances; for instance, it has added a 1% surtax on employee salaries effective for fiscal year 2020/21 (July 1st-June 30th), which will dampen consumer activity.
The authorities will eventually need to refocus on putting the public finances back on a more sustainable footing, and on structural and regulatory reforms to make Egypt more attractive to foreign investors, and to boost the domestic private sector. Significant hurdles remain for export-oriented industries. However, the influence of powerful interest groups, especially the extensive business interests of the military, will hamper the reform process and private-sector development even after the immediate pandemic crisis subsides.
Improving water and rail infrastructure and addressing rural under-development-especially in the restive Sinai region-will be prioritised later in the forecast period, aided by multilateral funding packages. Although the slump in global energy demand will damage short-term prospects and require the temporary suspension of some projects, delaying the sector's upstream and downstream development, Egypt will seek to advance its role as a regional energy hub for the eastern Mediterranean and as a gas exporter, drawing on regional ties.

Government debt 111.7 116.6 122.1 122.4 118.1 113.4
Fiscal performance in 2019/20 has been sustained by stronger performance earlier in the fiscal year, but the budgetary fallout from the pandemic will be sustained into 2020/21 and beyond. Lower economic activity and new tax breaks aimed at supporting businesses will dampen revenue collection, although the government has sought to offset this by reallocating levies normally accruing to government firms to the state budget from 2020/21, as well as introducing the 1% tax surcharge on salaried employees for 2020/21. The government will increase transfer payments to the poorest and public-sector wages and pensions in order to limit political discontent, adding to the fiscal burden. Dealing with the coronavirus will use up some of the cost savings from recent subsidy reductions, which will continue to be implemented in a bid to contain upward spending pressures.
Value-added tax (VAT) revenue, which generates close to half of tax revenue, will be depressed, but the government will leave the corporate tax rate unchanged at 22.5% in the early part of the forecast period in order to encourage a recovery in investment. Given the impact on revenue of the pandemic and the cost of mitigation measures, it is likely that the fiscal deficit, and therefore the debt-service burden, will rise considerably in the short term, despite lower policy interest rates. We expect the fiscal deficit to rise further in 2020/21, to 9.8% of GDP. The deficit will decline thereafter, but the rate of consolidation will ease in 2023/24 as election-related spending ahead of the presidential poll slows consolidation efforts. The deficit will average 7.4% of GDP in 2021/22-2023/24. Funding the deficit will involve domestic borrowing and tapping multilateral and bilateral sources in the early years of the forecast period, topped up with more costly sovereign bond issuance, driving public debt up to a peak of 122.3% of GDP at end-2021/22.

Monetary policy will prioritise stimulating the economy and financial markets in the short term. The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) cut its main rate by 300 basis points in mid-March to 9.25% in response to the coronavirus. Further cuts may be necessary in the short term, but the CBE will remain wary of currency volatility and renewed capital outflows or a return to higher inflation. Policy rates will therefore stabilise from 2021, and private-sector credit conditions are likely to improve broadly; the CBE will continue with stimulus measures aimed at reviving private-sector activity. The CBE has launched industrial and home-purchase stimulus schemes that aim to support a recovery in private-sector credit extension. Later in the forecast period, as inflationary pressures from rising international prices resume, the policy rate will rise modestly.

The impact of the coronavirus on trade and tourism flows and on domestic activity will last well into the first half of 2020/21. We expect the economy to contract overall in 2020/21, given the long-lasting hit to key sectors such as tourism. Tourism, which accounts for about 9.5% of employ-ment and 5.5% of GDP, has shut down and will be hit extremely hard, with many businesses unable to survive the shutdown. The tourism slump will further depress the retail and services sector. Multilateral backing will support continued government consumption and investment, but private consumption growth and exports will suffer heavily. The economy will expand from 2021/22 as global demand picks up in earnest and new energy projects gain momentum, driving investment. Lower unemployment will boost private consumption, although widespread poverty will remain a constraint on consumer demand growth. The construction and energy sectors will be the main engines of growth in the middle of the forecast period. The government is pursuing various low-income housing schemes with private contractors and is building a new (administrative) capital city east of Cairo, which has almost been completed. Capital goods imports will grow to support infrastructure projects.
Tourism and other export and service sectors will revive gradually after 2021. Confidence in the availability of hard currency will recover and help to attract foreign investors, especially from 2022. With growth becoming increasingly broad-based and unemployment falling, consumer spending should pick up more strongly in 2022-24. The development of hydrocarbons resources and processing capabilities could further boost expansion in the longer term, with growth forecast to average 4.4% a year in 2021/22-2023/24.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends The manufacturing sector, which includes oil refining, accounts for about 15% of real GDP, but the challenges facing the sector are numerous. Local manufacturing suffers from quality issues and is often unable to match competition from imported goods. The competitiveness of export-oriented manufactured goods has been undermined by a spike in the costs of imported intermediate goods and raw materials, and raw materials prices will weaken owing to the pandemic, and local currency appreciation will damage recent gains in export competitiveness. On top of this, many factories have been forced to curtail production significantly (or even shut down), owing initially to restrictions imposed to slow transmission of the coronavirus but also the impact of the pandemic on both domestic and global demand. The state statistics agency, CAPMAS, reported that more than 500,000 jobs were lost in manufacturing during the second quarter of 2020, although some sectors have been less affected. The oil-refining segment is set to grow rapidly in the next few years, with the completion of upgrades to a series of refineries. There are also prospects for growth in the petrochemicals sector. The building materials industry has benefited from demand for government-initiated construction and infrastructure, but the entry of military entities into this industry in recent years risks distorting this market.
Despite the subdued short-term outlook due to global energy demand weakness, the outlook for the oil and gas sector continues to improve, owing to substantial investments coming on stream from international oil companies (IOCs). Because of political instability, production in both sectors declined, and government debt owed to IOCs built up in the aftermath of the 2011 uprising. However, the natural gas industry has staged a vigorous recovery since late 2013, and IOCs remain strongly committed to Egypt, despite the current slump in the global oil and gas market. Arrears owed to IOCs for contracted gas purchases have fallen below US$1bn from a peak of above US$6bn, and the government has provided more attractive terms for exploration and production.
The leading operators, Eni of Italy and the UK's BP, have reached plateau production for their largest developments-Zohr and West Nile Delta, respectively-and are planning to develop fresh discoveries off the eastern coast of the Delta in the next few years. US majors ExxonMobil and Chevron have also taken on exploration blocks in Egypt's west Mediterranean offshore sector, and Chevron has secured one of the two blocks awarded in the Red Sea, in an inaugural bid round for this area. Egypt has reined in its natural gas production owing to the weakness of the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market, but as prices recover it will have an opportunity to ramp up exports. The two LNG export terminals, in Idku and Damietta, are also likely to start processing Israeli gas during the forecast period. Adding Cypriot gas to this mix will depend on whether the tensions in the eastern Mediterranean arising from Turkey's maritime claims can be resolved, which is unlikely. Egypt's own gas consumption declined slightly in 2019, owing mainly to the increased efficiency of newly commissioned power stations. We expect Egypt to continue to have a surplus of natural gas supply over demand during the forecast period. Oil production is likely to continue to decline, as most of the main fields have reached maturity, but the upgrades to the refining sector will allow for a reduction in petroleum products imports, even though crude oil imports will increase. The mining sector is also likely to show strong growth in the forecast period following the entry into force of a new law that replaces the oil-based production sharing model with a tax and royalty scheme. Prospects for further development of gold resources in the eastern desert are highly promising, and interest has been galvanised by the surge in gold prices since the pandemic started.
The services sector-another major employer and traditionally a significant component of the economy-has experienced repeated setbacks. Tourism suffered a prolonged slump after the downing of a Russian airliner over Sinai by militants in October 2015, and the sector was hit hard once more in early 2020 by the coronavirus pandemic. The recovery after the Sinai crash started to gain momentum in 2018, and in 2019 arrivals rose to 13m, the highest since 2010; the sector contributed US$13bn to the current account in 2019, according to the Central Bank of Egypt. However, following the outbreak of the coronavirus (Covid-19), the government closed Egypt to foreign tourists in March 2020, and there has only been a limited reopening since July. The sector accounts for 10-15% of GDP and provides employment for about 3m Egyptians. The impact of the pandemic and associated travel restrictions and requirements in key markets will continue for much of 2021, and any recovery to pre-coronavirus levels is unlikely before 2023. Other important components of services, including the financial services and information and communications technology (ICT) sectors, which have been strong drivers of growth in recent years, will suffer some weakness as a result of the pandemic but, particularly for ICT, the crisis could also create new opportunities, and these industries will see a swifter pick-up than tourism.
Construction and transport are likely to continue to be among the fastest-growing sectors. These sectors have been affected by the pandemic (including a brief slowdown in building as a result of pandemic restrictions, but also owing to concerns about surplus demand), but to a lesser degree than in other areas of the economy. Projects such as the new administrative capital and 13 other satellite cities under development will underpin strong growth in the construction and building materials sectors. The first phase of the new capital is nearing completion, and private developers are preparing to embark on building new residential and commercial areas. The main foreign participant is China State Construction and Engineering Corporation, which is building the central business district. The new capital has generated a number of major transport schemes, notably a new monorail system that will link it to Cairo, and which will include a line from Cairo to the 6th of October City industrial and residential area to the south-west. The government is also promoting investment in logistics, including a series of inland dry ports to be carried out on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis.

Consumer prices 9.2 5.6 6.0 6.1 5.5 5.4
Despite an uptick in food prices (which comprise about one-third of the consumer price basket) amid supply concerns early in the pandemic and a price increase in public transport fares, inflation will ease to an average 5.6% in 2020, because of the slump in international oil prices, declining non-oil commodity prices, and faltering domestic demand. We expect inflation to rise to an average of 6% in 2021-22 amid excess liquidity, but currency appreciation will help to offset the impact of higher international oil prices and stronger domestic demand. Annual inflation should ease to about 5.5% in 2023-24.

In 2020 the impact of the coronavirus on hard-currency earnings and financial markets will lead to increasing currency volatility. The pandemic has put pressure on emerging-market capital flows. After initial volatility in March the pound stabilised, but at the expense of foreign reserves, which fell sharply in March-May (although they remain above six months of import cover). In anticipation that the IMF would require a return to a free float as part of its SBA framework, temporarily reinstated foreign-currency liquidity guarantees for foreign investors have been removed, allowing the currency to depreciate before stabilising again in mid-July and subsequently appreciating. The pound will be volatile into 2021. In the longer term, we expect renewed real exchange-rate appreciation, reflecting a growing natural-resource endowment and contained inflation. The pound will still come under renewed pressure at times of crisis, although the level of intervention will fall. We expect the pound to strengthen to an average of E£15.72:US$1 in 2024.

The trade deficit will narrow sharply in 2020 as the decline in the value of energy imports outpaces the fall in export earnings in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Gas prices have also plummeted, but in the longer term gas exports and non-hydrocarbons exports will pick up as global demand recovers. However, from 2021-22 capital goods inputs for infrastructure projects and stronger consumer demand will push up import spending too, and the trade deficit will rise in nominal terms, although it will decline as a share of GDP during 2020-24, averaging a manageable 7.3% of GDP.
Services exports will fall sharply in 2020, hit by the impact on Suez Canal revenue of the disruption of trade flows caused by the coronavirus and the collapse in tourism, which accounts for about 15% of current-account receipts. Sources of income such as official transfers and remittances will also be hit in 2020, but will grow thereafter. The current-account deficit will widen in 2020 to 4.3% of GDP, although it will narrow thereafter. The CBE has sufficient foreign-exchange reserves to cover the deficit in 2020, and is able to call on support from the IMF and Gulf Arab allies.t

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Egypt Stocks and flows The government changed its methodology for assessing foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in July 2018 to include all undistributed realised earnings whereas previously it only counted reinvested earnings; this has raised the total FDI inflow level. Inflows FDI are set to fall during 2020 (net FDI inflows were US$970m in the first quarter of 2020, about 60% lower than in the same period of 2019 according to central bank data) as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, after averaging about US$8bn per year since 2016, with an uptick to US$9bn in 2019. However, we expect there to be a relatively rapid recovery as a result of the momentum that had previously been built up in sectors such as natural gas, infrastructure, mining and telecommunications. The government's efforts to improve the environment for foreign investors through new legislation passed in 2017 did not immediately have the desired result, as the oil and gas sector, which was not covered by these laws, continued to account for the bulk of FDI inflows. The government has since sought to address some of the flaws that investors have highlighted in the legislation, and it has made an effort to streamline the decision-making process by abolishing the Ministry of Investment and enhancing the powers of the head of the General Authority for Investment, who now reports directly to the prime minister. The increased role of the military establishment in the economy will have a mixed impact on FDI. On the one hand, it will deter investors from sectors in which military entities are perceived to have a competitive advantage, but, on the other hand, some investors will be content to form joint ventures with military agencies in the hope that this will give them a competitive edge. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a recovery-initially fairly slow, reflecting global economic weakness-during the forecast period, reflecting improvements in the business environment and a wider availability of hard currency to meet business needs. We also forecast that outward direct investment will increase during the forecast period as healthier liquidity levels and easing foreign-exchange shortages enable companies to expand their overseas operations.
Origin and distribution EU-based investors, the majority of which are British firms, have accounted for about two-thirds of total inward FDI flows to Egypt during the past five years, and the US and Arab countries have supplied most of the remainder. The UAE, which is Egypt's closest regional ally, has been the largest source of investment among Arab countries, by a significant margin, followed by Saudi Arabia and Qatar. UAE banks are now poised to increase their presence in the Egyptian market by acquiring ventures set up by two Lebanese banks, and Saudi Telecom has agreed in principle to acquire the Egyptian arm of British-based Vodafone. Chinese companies have shown increasing interest in investing in Egypt, but, according to the most recent central bank data, China accounted for only about 1% of gross FDI inflows in 2017/18 and 2018/19. A slowing Chinese economy, as well as the US-Chinese trade and technology disputes, are likely to hamper further growth in investment from China. FDI inflows are heavily skewed towards the oil and gas sector, reflecting the major ongoing investment in developing new natural gas fields. In the first three-quarters of 2018/19, oil and gas accounted for 62% of total new FDI inflows, compared with 19% for greenfield projects and 16% for real estate.
Determinants Besides market size and the availability of cheap labour, the main determinants of FDI include the business and legal environment and the availability of foreign exchange for imports and profit repatriation. Under the current regime, the government is seeking to resolve a number of long-running disputes with Gulf Arab (and other foreign) investors, as part of a broader effort to encourage regional players to increase their activity in Egypt. Efforts to establish new free zones-such as the Suez Canal Development Zone-could help to court investments, and the sovereign wealth fund (Tharaa) established in 2018 has been designed as a channel for FDI. Downside risks to FDI will persist. These include business environment deficiencies, weak lending by domestic banks and the global economic slump resulting from the coronavirus pandemic.
Impact Increased FDI has helped to transform Egypt into a more modern market economy. Foreign firms are aiding economic diversification, improving the quality of human capital through better managerial and technical skills, increasing employment opportunities and assisting the transfer of technology. Leading petroleum firms are helping the government to exploit its rich oil and gas endowment and generating budget revenue.

Egypt's population will exceed 100m by the end of the forecast period Egypt's growing population provides opportunities for economic development but is also among the biggest challenges facing the govern-ment, as it places additional strains on the labour market and public services such as healthcare and education. The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that the population will rise from 98.9m in 2019 to 108.9m by 2024, an annual growth rate of 1.9%-nearly double the average for most developing countries but considerably lower than in the historic period despite the return in 2020 of expatriate workers from the Gulf and from Jordan (almost 10m Egyptians reside abroad), affected by the pandemic. Rural areas will experience higher growth rates than urban centres. The slower growth rate reflects our expectation that recent family-planning campaigns and the high cost of living since the 2016 currency flotation will reduce fertility rates.
Almost one-third of the population is below the age of 15, and more than half is below 24. About 700,000 new entrants join the labour market annually, and unemployment rose in the wake of the 2011 uprising, as real GDP growth averaged well below the 6-7% required to absorb the growing labour force. Since 2014 the unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of over 13% to below 8% by early 2020. However, the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in heavy job losses, pushing the unemployment rate above 9.6% as at end-June 2020, according to CAPMAS, the state statistics agency. The underlying situation is worse that this figure suggests, as there has been a large-scale withdrawal of women from the labour force. The unemployment rate for men rose from 4.5% to 8.5%, with 1.9m registered as out of work at end-June, compared with 1.07m at end-March; the female unemployment rate fell to 16.3% from 21.9%, with the number out of work almost halving to 640,000. The number of men in the total workforce dropped to 22.7m from 23.8m, while the number of women decreased from 5.2m to 3.9m. These trends were reflected in a sharp fall in the labour participation rate, which had already been trending down in recent years--to 38.9% from 42.7% in the first quarter. Government efforts to address unemployment have failed to resolve deep structural shortcomings and the lack of opportunities, particularly for younger graduates. The outlet of seeking work overseas will also be constrained in the medium term by the global pandemic.
Outward migration to the Gulf states, Europe and North America will be more limited Outward migration from Egypt to neighbouring Gulf Arab states, Europe and North America is likely to resume, but the coronavirus pandemic means that there will be fewer opportunities in these areas. Hundreds of thousands of Egyptians have been forced to return home from the Gulf during 2020. Expatriate remittances are among the major sources of foreign-exchange receipts for Egypt. Even before the pandemic, migrating to the oil-rich Gulf Arab states was becoming increasingly difficult, as these countries have stepped up their programmes to increase the proportion of their own nationals in the workforce. Similarly, public opinion in Europe and North America is turning increasingly against economic migrants, which is likely to be reflected in tighter immigration rules and restrictions on foreign labour inflows.
Poverty rate continues to rise Other consequences of Egypt's recent political and economic turbulence include a rise in the rate of poverty since 2011. According to the results of a household survey by CAPMAS, the poverty rate (calculated at an income below E£735.7 per head per month, (US$41) reached 32.5% in the 2017/18 fiscal year. This was 4.7 percentage points higher than in the previous published survey, for 2014/15, and reflected the impact of economic reforms enacted since 2016 that have squeezed household spending power. The government claims that the effects of the rise in the poverty rate have been mitigated by social protection programmes, but consumer spending has been hit. The absolute poverty rate in 2017/18 was 6.2%, according to a line set at E£490.8 per month, compared with a rate of 5.3% in 2014/15, based on income of E£322 per month.
Egypt has a highly urbanised population, with nearly 10m people living in Cairo alone. The current government has taken steps to promote internal migration from the overcrowded Nile Valley into unpopulated tracts of desert. These include a demarcation plan to create three new governorates-Central Sinai, Al Alamein and Al Wahat-bringing the total to 30. The government is also undertaking a number of major industrial projects outside urban centres, such as the Suez Canal Development Zone, with the aim of boosting employ-ment opportunities in the long-neglected rural areas. The government has embarked on the construction of 14 new satellite cities. The largest of these is the new administrative capital, where some government ministries have relocated and which is envisaged as eventually housing some 6m people.

The pandemic will undermine the beginning of a recovery in incomes Purchasing power was eroded in the immediate aftermath of the November 2016 currency flotation, which led to severe inflationary effects and pushed down disposable incomes. Amid this challenging backdrop, retail sales declined in 2017 in US-dollar terms-although there was some recovery in 2018 as inflation started to fall. GDP per head in US dollar terms only returned to pre-flotation levels in 2019/20 and suffered a further setback following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. However, with the currency appreciating, the overall impact will be of stagnation (with a weak decline in purchasing power terms in 2021) and then slow growth in per capita GDP in the early years of the forecast period, before a stronger recovery from 2022/23. Egypt's GDP per head is expected to climb to US$5,021 by 2024, although this will remain low by regional standards. Even with the pandemic stalling the recovery in per capita incomes in the short-term, as the most populous country in the Middle East and North Africa, Egypt's large size makes it an important regional market, with huge potential (particularly in the second half of the forecast period) that will continue to grow over the long term. The population is easily accessible, not least because it is located in an extremely concentrated geographical area. However, the headline figures mask wide income disparities between rich and poor.
Wide income disparities remain Nevertheless, the spending power of a sizeable minority of the population, who reside mainly in newly built cities and neighbourhoods such as New Cairo and 6th of October, is comparable to that of consumers in the industrialised world. They will be less affected than lower-paid Egyptians by the pandemic and will find it easier to rebuild wealth. This segment retains substantial disposable income and beyond the immediate uncertainty of the pandemic period will be willing to spend it on consumer goods. A government survey published in July 2016 showed that the richest 10% of the population accounted for one-quarter of total spending by Egyptians. This indicates the extent of the inequality between rich and poor households in the country, with recent increases in the poverty rate likely to have intensified this polarisation. Later in the forecast period, as the economy recovers, inflation stays more manageable, and unemployment begins to fall again, this will help to boost private consumption; purchasing power will improve across a wider swathe of the population although large disparities will still remain.
Egypt's retail markets have seen little investment since 2011, which means that the market is under-saturated, and assets are under-priced. This could provide investment opportunities, but prospective investors are likely to wait until they have made a thorough assessment of the impact of the pandemic on consumer behaviour, with e-commerce finally beginning to gain substantial ground.

In common with the rest of the region, spending on food, beverages and tobacco accounts for the largest share of total consumer expenditure, and this will remain the case throughout the forecast period. With the pandemic denting incomes, consumer expenditure on basic necessities as a share of the total will rise sharply in 2020, before easing thereafter. Even by 2024, spending on basic household items, primarily food and beverages, as well as spending on housing, will dominate household expenditure. This is because a substantial chunk of the population will remain at or just above the poverty line, with only sufficient disposable income for subsistence; poverty rates have risen over the historical period although they are likely to begin to edge down in the forecast period, translating into a slow shift in spending patterns among some groups. There were signs of a recovery in consumer spending as the inflation rate fell to about 5% in late 2019 and early 2020, but this recovery has been knocked back heavily by the coronavirus pandemic.
In the long run, demand for higher-end consumer goods will be underpinned by rising incomes, employment and population growth. Demand for more sophisticated, foreign-produced electrical goods is certain to grow, not least because of mistrust of the quality of locally produced goods. Other markets will increase in importance as the forecast period progresses, however, notably transport and communications. As car ownership rises and demand for mobile and internet technology takes off, a rising proportion of household income will be spent on these items.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Initial conditions: Egypt began addressing decades-old market distortions in 2016, backed by significant external financial support, which has been broadly sustained during the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing economic instability. The government has retained the policies adopted since 2016-centred around economic liberalisation and rationalising the public finances--but progress has been slow at times. Moreover, the public finances and external debt position will be further stretched in the pandemic, with the government entering the crisis under a large (but until 2020 gradually declining) fiscal deficit. Nonetheless, the agreement reached with the IMF in 2016 and the subsequent economic policy changes have helped to shore up investor confidence in the economy, and this has been further reinforced by the extent of renewed IMF and other multilateral and bilateral support that Egypt has received to cope with the shock to domestic and external finances from the pandemic. The economy is well diversified, and the abundance of cheap labour, coupled with its large market size, means that Egypt still has huge potential over the long term, although the large and still rapidly growing population also poses serious infrastructure and social stability challenges.
Demographic trends: Egypt's high population density has some advantages: access to consumers is relatively easy, especially in the two urban centres, Cairo and Alexandria. Overall population growth will begin to slow, owing to higher levels of development and government family-planning policies, but will remain high. Demographic trends are broadly favourable to growth prospects, in that the working-age population will continue to rise more rapidly than the overall population throughout the forecast period owing to the youthful demographic bulge. However, this will also add to the burden on public services such as education and healthcare. The government will press ahead with projects to develop areas of the desert beyond the Nile Valley to alleviate pressure on infrastructure. This will be supported by the government's efforts to reclaim 1.5m feddans (630,000 ha) of land. With most of the land surface uninhabited, the government will push ahead with long-awaited plans to create a number of new governorates, an idea that was first mooted in 2005 and later revived by the president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, in late 2014, who has since pushed forward with major urban construction projects, including a new administrative capital.
External conditions: External conditions will remain dependent on demand from key export markets in North America and the EU-Egypt's largest trading partner. These have been heavily affected by the coronavirus pandemic, but in the longer term should be restored to growth, especially with the US. The broader region is also embroiled in political and security turmoil, which will continue to dampen investment sentiment across the Middle East as a whole. Increased tensions with Turkey will remain a concern, particularly in terms of Egypt's ambitions to leverage its growing natural gas resource capacity and processing facilities to solidify its role as an energy hub for that region, but despite these concerns, this will be an important area of growth and co-operation with countries such as Israel, Cyprus, Greece and elsewhere in southern Europe. Over the longer term, economic recovery in Europe and the US should translate into higher inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) as well as growing exports. Similarly, reliance on financial assistance should decline gradually as structural reforms put the economy back on a sustainable footing.
Institutions and policy trends: The present and future governments will work to streamline the bureaucracy and boost the accountability of public officials. They will also look to downsize the bloated public sector, which means that private-sector participation in the economy and attracting FDI will be key to developing the country's infrastructure and improving public services. However, such reforms will be slow and protracted, largely as a result of the presence of deeply entrenched interest groups in the government and the powerful influence of business lobby groups and of the military on the state. Moreover, democratic accountability will stay low with authority centred around the presidency. Threats to long-term political and social stability may persist, reflecting the stand-off between the state and its liberal opponents, as well as high unemployment rates and high levels of poverty.
Long-term performance: There is significant potential for strong real GDP growth over the long term. Egypt is a prime location as a base to export to Asia, Africa and Europe and has a plentiful and low-cost workforce. However, success will also depend on an ongoing commitment to economic reform and to major improvements in political and institutional effectiveness. The government must increase the efficiency of the bureaucracy; develop a more effective commercial legal system; continue to withdraw the state from economic activity; and reform the public finances. Progress is likely to be patchy, but The Economist Intelligence Unit expects real GDP growth to average 4.2% a year in 2020-30 and 4.3% in 2020-50, with labour productivity growth helping to offset slower population growth.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Egypt has been struggling with rising temperatures in recent years, with summer heat typically averaging above 35˚C. This results in spikes in energy consumption during the hot summer season by both households and industrial users. However, successive heat waves and worsening climate conditions globally could create new health dangers for residents of the country, as well as the broader Middle East and North Africa region-particularly as the summer season lengthens and humidity levels rise further. This may also reduce arable land in Egypt, which is already facing the threat of worsening water scarcity as construction and the filling of the Grand Renaissance Dam (located on the Nile, downstream in Ethiopia) is completed in the coming years; Egypt is especially concerned that Ethiopia has not agreed to terms that will dictate water filling according to hydrological and climatic conditions. In addition to continuing to seek an agreement on these issues, Egypt will accelerate efforts to develop other water sources, especially desalination. The impact that higher air temperatures and humidity will have in reducing the ability of the human body to cool off through sweating is likely to lower the productivity of workers involved in construction and other outdoor activities (even at night). All of this will boost demand for energy further as time goes by and weather conditions deteriorate. The government is increasingly looking to renewable sources, especially solar, to meet power demand and is also beginning work on nuclear energy provision, but remains heavily dependent on natural gas. As part of managing the greater demand for energy, local authorities will need to diversify the energy mix to include more renewable sources of power.
Technological developments The government envisages the technology sector as being one of the main drivers of economic growth over the next five years, including the development of new information and communications technology (ICT) investment clusters, for example a proposed technology valley in the Suez Canal Economic Zone. Telecoms and the ICT sector have grown rapidly in recent years as 4G rollout has accelerated. Future growth is highly likely, considering the growing interest by foreigners in Egypt as a budding offshore IT centre. Indeed, despite the modest performance by regional comparison, Egypt has been gaining increasing attention by foreign companies as an outsourcing centre for IT operations-owing in part to the abundance of skilled workers and the country's proximity to European markets. A report by Gartner, an IT advisory group, ranked Egypt among the top nine locations for outsourcing in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
There are currently more than 6,000 Egyptian companies active in the ICT sector, most of them in activities related to the internet. E-commerce and fintech have grown strongly during the pandemic crisis albeit from a low base. The government estimates that Egypt earns about US$1.5bn in annual exports of ICT-related services, and this figure is likely to climb significantly in the long term. ICT accounted for about 4% of GDP in 2018/19, according to the government, and it plans for it to reach 5% of GDP by 2022, targeting 12% growth a year in the sector; the growth target will be hampered by the coronavirus pandemic but its share of GDP will rise. Exports of digital services have also grown strongly. The government is rolling out e-government services for households in select areas; internet penetration is still fairly modest, although it is used in the business sector more widely. The number of internet users has risen strongly with the government estimating that almost 70% of individuals were using the internet on a daily basis by early 2020, according to Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) data. Almost one-half of households had fixed broadband access to the internet by early 2020, compared with about 20% a decade earlier, and about 47% of households used mobile broadband (nearly all households have access to a mobile phone). Household home internet coverage in urban areas is far higher (about 70%) compared with rural areas (about 50%) where improved mobile services could play a particularly important role. The number of mobile internet subscriptions grew by 11.2% year on year in the first quarter of 2020, according to MCIT data while ADSL subscribers grew by 10.4%. Internet bandwidth is also growing, but at a slightly slower pace than the number of subscribers.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only 26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2015-19) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2020-24). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2015-19. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2020-24 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2015-19 ranges are then used to derive 2020-24 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2020-24, not to the likely situation in 2024 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2017 or 2022). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the current government to serve out its second term, which will expire in 2024. We expect the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to run a highly centralised administration and to make some progress on pushing through structural reform.
- A deadly clash between Indian and Chinese troops in a disputed border area in June 2020 has caused deterioration in diplomatic and economic ties, but we do not foresee a large-scale military clash. The incident will cause India to seek warmer relations with the US and its allies. Bilateral relations with Pakistan will also remain strained, but we do not expect outright hostilities.
- As a result of economic pressure, we expect the government to continue to unwind gradually the lockdown measures introduced in March. The ongoing spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) may overwhelm India's healthcare system.
- The budget deficit will widen to 7.9% of GDP in fiscal year 2020/21 (April-March) amid lower tax revenue and stimulus expenditures. The deficit will narrow but nevertheless remain wide between 2021/22-2024/25.
- We expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) to cut interest rates by another 50 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2020. Its main policy rate will be cut to 3.5%. The RBI will also tweak its policy tools and regulatory framework to facilitate the transmission of accommodative monetary policy.
- Real GDP will contract by 8.5% in 2020/21. A combination of pre-existing credit strain among non-bank financial companies and a marked deterioration in the creditworthiness of stressed firms will restrain the pace of recovery; we expect the economy to grow by 6.7% in 2021/22.
- We forecast the rupee to depreciate against the US dollar in nominal terms in 2020, averaging Rs74.5:US$1 amid the subdued domestic economy. It will strengthen slightly in 2021 before depreciating again between 2022 and 2024.
- The trade deficit will narrow in 2020 amid a slump in global oil prices. It will widen from 2021 as India increases imports of capital goods. Business outsourcing and information technology will remain the key service export sectors in 2020-24.

Country forecast overview: India's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: The government takes steps towards partial privatisation of some state-owned companies in 2021.
2022-24: The government continues to rationalise liquidation and bankruptcy laws to simplify the closure of loss-making businesses or merger-and-acquisition activity involving other corporate entities.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: The government's policy towards foreign direct investment (FDI) will remain ambiguous.
2022-24: Foreign investment in export manufacturing increases markedly, albeit in only a few regions. Strong growth in e-commerce and the expanding Reliance Jio telecommunications platform will attract FDI from leading internet firms.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: The country remains reluctant to join major regional trade deals. However, the government seeks to hold talks with members of the OECD to strengthen trade links.
2022-24: Full capital-account convertibility remains off the policy agenda.
Taxes 2020-21: Rationalisation of the goods and services tax (GST) continues, resulting in a reduction in the number of tax bands. Tax breaks and rebates are made available to businesses and individuals affected by the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak.
2022-24: Alcohol and petroleum products remain outside the scope of the GST.
Financing 2020-21: Bank lending growth will slow amid a decline in creditworthiness among defaulting borrowers, raising average loan rates and financing costs
2022-24: Private-sector banks account for a rising share of total lending, while bad debt issues persist in public-sector banks. Major consolidation and privatisations among the public-sector banks will continue.
The labour market 2020-21: Unemployment is high amid containment measures. Wage growth decelerates.
2022-24: Some labour reforms make headway at state level. However, reforms at the central government level remain stuck, owing to a lack of political consensus in support of the changes.
Infrastructure 2020-21: Containment measures slow down the construction of major infrastructure projects.
2022-24: As some projects near completion, India's infrastructure improves in terms of broadband connection speed, distribution, road and rail networks, ports and transport infrastructure, as well as electricity and office space supply.
Technological readiness 2020-21: Most technological innovation continues to be concentrated in a few clusters, such as Bangalore. Expenditure on research and development as a proportion of GDP remains low by Asian standards.
2022-24: The government makes efforts to digitise the delivery of public services, in an effort to cut corruption and promote the efficiency of "last-mile delivery". In this context, the Aadhar biometrics platform boosts government service delivery.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates. b Actual.
Background: India gained independence in 1947 after two centuries of British colonial rule. Partition at the same time created the state of Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars (two of them over the disputed territory of Kashmir). India is the second-most populous country in the world, with an estimated 1.37bn people in 2019, according to the UN. Its economy was the third-largest in the world in 2019 (measured in nominal US dollars at purchasing power parity exchange rates by the World Bank).
Political structure: India has been a democracy since independence. At federal level, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) holds a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), although it governs in a broader coalition, the National Democratic Alliance. India follows the UK model of parliamentary government, with a prime minister as head of government. It has a president as the head of state. The country has a quasi-federal structure, with state governments having their own legislatures and enjoying a fair degree of freedom.
Policy issues: We expect the ruling BJP to undertake policy reforms once the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic passes. The government has already announced measures to privatise or merge public-sector units in many industries to promote competition. The government will also make modest progress on the liberalisation of regulatory requirements and foreign investment. However, the primary focus of the government will be on structural reform, particularly the contentious labour and land laws. We expect only incremental progress on these issues. The current administration has made headway in speeding up infrastructure projects, and this will also remain a priority in the next five years.
Taxation: The government will maintain efforts to broaden the tax base in 2020-24, including by further digitising tax departments. This, coupled with strong economic growth after 2020, will support a pick-up in tax collection. Despite some reforms, including a nationwide goods and services tax in 2017, India's tax system will remain highly complex.
Foreign trade: India's merchandise trade deficit narrowed to US$157.7bn in 2019, from US$186.7bn in 2018, while the surplus on the country's services account rose from US$80.8bn to US$84.2bn in the same period.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that, with a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) and an impending majority in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house), the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will stay in power for its full term, which ends in 2024. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, who will remain the dominant figure in the government, is widely popular. Decision-making will remain centralised among the prime minister's office and key ministers.
The government is keen to facilitate an exit from the economically costly containment restrictions. However, the unabated and accelerated spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) epidemic and the extensive economic damage caused by the restrictions highlight the risk of social unrest. The government's inability to provide large-scale income support will challenge the administration. We expect its reform agenda, especially the liberalisation of labour laws, to be another source of tension. However, these developments will not unseat the government; this is because of the support it enjoys from a large part of the citizenry and the lack of a strong opposition.
Over the medium term, protests by religious groups and communal clashes will continue to pose a threat to political stability. Large-scale protests tied to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) were only cut short by social distancing measures introduced to slow the spread of the virus. In contrast to the country's current secular constitution, several far-right groups, including some affiliated with the BJP, have long been pushing for India to be recast as a Hindu nation-a view that puts them at odds with minority groups in the country, notably Muslims. The risk of social instability will be high in the latter part of the forecast period, particularly in the two-year period prior to the 2024 general election, if the ruling party moves ahead with its Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) agenda.
The security situation in the centrally administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) will remain a concern throughout the forecast period. We expect security risks in the area to remain high. We believe that any attempt at protest is likely to face a heavy-handed response from the government, including the use of internet shutdowns, curfews and riot-control forces. The government's move has also increased the risk of terrorist attack by separatist forces in major Indian cities. A deadly border clash with Chinese troops in June 2020 will also affect political stability. Vocal domestic demands for a strong response pose political risks for Mr Modi, who will be reluctant to risk military escalation.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch The next general election is expected to be held around May 2024. The focus before then will be the state assembly elections. Historical precedent suggests that voters treat state and national elections differently, and that local issues tend to be more important in the former. We expect the BJP coalition to gain control of the state assembly in the upcoming Bihar election, to be held in October-November 2020, but only with the help of its coalition partner, Janata Dal (United).
The BJP and its allies form the largest grouping in the Rajya Sabha, although they command fewer than half of the seats. Nevertheless, we expect the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to win control of a majority in the upper house by end-2020 after elections in key seats in November. This will enable the alliance to pass legislation without opposition approval. However, it will struggle to win the two-thirds majority needed to make constitutional changes unchallenged.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations Tensions with Pakistan have persisted amid the dispute over J&K. We expect relations to remain strained, but do not anticipate a complete breakdown of diplomatic ties. We believe that Pakistan's military will increase its support for militant groups in Indian-controlled Kashmir. This will raise the risk of terrorist attacks by non-state actors. Although small-scale military exchanges between the two countries are likely to occur in 2020-24, their nuclear arsenals will act as a powerful deterrent against full-scale conflict.
A deadly border clash between China and India in June has led to a substantial deterioration in bilateral relations. India retaliated economically against China, including by banning Chinese mobile apps and increasing non-tariff barriers on Chinese exports to India. We expect China to respond primarily with tit-for-tat tariff increases, rather than more detrimental export restrictions that could disrupt supply chains for Indian firms. We also expect further skirmishes tied to infrastructure development in border regions disputed by the two countries. However, large-scale military clashes are not within our core forecast.
Souring ties with China will encourage India to improve relations with the US, Japan and Australia, among other countries. India's foreign policy within South Asia will also focus on countering increasing Chinese influence in Nepal and Sri Lanka. India's relations with Bangladesh will remain cordial.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends The government's majority in the lower house will give it flexibility in determining the economic policy agenda. Its key near-term priority will be controlling the coronavirus outbreak, to which India is particularly vulnerable, given its large population and weak healthcare infrastructure. The spread of the disease remains rampant; nevertheless, we do not expect the government to reintroduce a nationwide lockdown. Sporadic local containment measures will be adopted in states and cities in the coming months to ease pressure on the healthcare system in those areas.
We expect the government to take up policy reform after the crisis, as it looks to support growth. It plans to open up more sectors of the economy to private firms, by privatising or reducing the number of public-sector units. The administration will undertake piecemeal changes to legislation, such as a relaxation of regulatory requirements and a modest liberalisation of foreign direct investment rules. In terms of improving the business environment, one area of attention will be the liberalisation of contentious labour and land laws. Progress on this will be limited and the benefits will only be felt in the latter part of the forecast period.
The lockdown will amplify the mounting issue of non-performing loans (NPLs) in the banking and non-bank financial companies (NBFC) sector. The govern-ment will recapitalise some major banks and is also likely to arrange further consolidation of the sector, focusing on banks that are close to insolvency. However, these steps will prove inadequate to rejuvenate the financial system in 2021; lending to the private sector will fall well short of demand. Infrastructure projects-particularly pet projects of the Modi government, such as the National Infrastructure Pipeline-remain a priority, in response to the rapid pace of urbanisation and to boost the business environment. However, we expect a revival in infrastructure spending only from the fourth quarter of 2020, once the coronavirus outbreak has been brought under greater control.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy The coronavirus outbreak will prompt a wider average budget deficit in 2020-24 compared with the annual average of 3.8% recorded in 2015-19. The government will temporarily suspend the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act to allow for more flexibility in supporting the economy. The containment measures have prompted an unbudgeted increase in social spending, especially through the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, as well as an extension of existing support schemes for businesses.
The government announced an Rs20trn (US$268bn) package (equivalent to around 10% of GDP) to support the economy in May. However, this headline figure includes liquidity measures provided by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) and advances by banks under the government's measures. The actual amount of additional budgetary spending announced equates to around 1.4% of GDP. We expect the government to announce another fiscal package, worth 1-1.5% of GDP, in the fourth quarter of 2020, including an infrastructure development programme. In view of a fall in revenue and lower nominal GDP, the budget deficit is forecast to widen to the equivalent of 7.9% of GDP in 2020/21.
As the economy recovers, the government will look to consolidate the public finances gradually. This will narrow the budget deficit to the equivalent of 6.8% of GDP in 2021/22, and 5.9% of GDP in 2022/23. The authorities will look to deepen the tax base and increase (currently low) levels of tax compliance. However, the need to support welfare payments and infrastructure spending will maintain upward pressure on fiscal expenditure. We also expect subsidies to remain in place for small labour-intensive businesses, particularly those that are export-focused. This federal fiscal picture does not reflect the true level of the deficit. The deficits of many states and part of the expenditure of public-sector units represent implicit liabilities for the central government.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy The coronavirus epidemic will prompt further monetary policy loosening by the RBI. The central bank has lowered its policy repo rate by 115 basis points since May, to 4%, while also widening the monetary policy corridor by lowering the reverse repo rate (the "floor" of the corridor) by 155 basis points, to 3.35%. With inflationary pressure expected to moderate and economic growth at a far slower pace, we expect a further 50-basis-point reduction in the policy repo rate over the remainder of 2020. We also expect the further adoption of unconventional policy instruments, which will include more long-term refinancing operations.
Monetary policy will aim to support businesses. However, the outcome may be far from satisfactory, as monetary policy transmission is not smooth. While lending from the banking sector to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises will improve in 2020, as the government has provided a guarantee for those loans, banks will be reluctant to lend to other parts of the economy in the medium term, given increased risk. The level of non-performing assets in the financial sector is alarming, and the coronavirus outbreak will only exacerbate the issue, with more firms forced out of business. Policy support from the central bank and the government will be inadequate to support the recovery of the banking sector after the pandemic.
The RBI has maintained inflation-targeting as the cornerstone of its monetary policy framework. It seeks to contain consumer price inflation within a range of 2-6% and close to a target of 4%. However, strong political pressure on the RBI-which has forced out two hawkish heads of the bank under BJP rule-has complicated the achievement of these objectives.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth We expect real GDP to contract by 8.5% in 2020/21-the sharpest annual decline in economic activity since India's independence in 1947. This is primarily the result of a 23.9% year-on-year contraction in April-June (the first quarter of the fiscal year), reflecting the impact of India's stringent lockdown measures. The economy will continue to contract year on year in the second and third quarters as the administration is unable to control the spread of the virus and intermittent local lockdown measures are put in place. We do not expect the economy to register growth on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of 2020/21, as job losses, business closures and social distancing measures depress activity. Sectors such as travel, hospitality and tourism will be the most affected.
On a GDP expenditure basis, we expect private consumption to contract sharply in 2020/21, as people's economic activities are constrained during lockdown and as consumption remains low, even after the restrictions are lifted. Investment spending is also expected to decline steeply as firms postpone activity amid high uncertainty. We also expect increased loan liabilities to be taken up by corporates and banks to further discourage new investment.
We have moderated our growth forecast for 2021/22 to 6.7%, from 9.1% previously. Our reassessment of the speed of the recovery in the financial sector suggests that rising NPLs will have a negative effect on banks' balance sheets. A combination of pre-existing credit strain among NBFCs and a marked deterioration in firms' creditworthiness will restrain the pace of recovery and limit investment and consumption. This trend will continue to weigh on growth in the medium term: we expect economic growth in 2022/23-2024/25 to average only 5.3% a year-slower than the annual average of 6.7% in 2015-19. Incremental progress on structural reform will provide some support for growth in the latter part of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation We expect consumer prices to increase by an average of 5.2% in 2020 as a whole. While food price inflation has remained elevated during the lockdown, we expect it to moderate once supply-side constraints ease towards the beginning of the fourth quarter. Non-food inflation will continue to lag behind food inflation, helping to prevent a rapid pick-up in the overall consumer price index. Our forecast assumes a normal monsoon this year (and in every year of the outlook period).
Relatively subdued inflationary pressures in 2021 will afford the RBI scope to keep its policy rate unchanged in that year as it continues to support the economy. The slowing investment resulting from the gradual tightening of the monetary policy stance in 2022 will offset the inflationary impact of strengthening oil prices. The central bank will accord higher priority to containing inflationary pressures towards the end of the forecast period; consumer price inflation is expected to average 4.4% in 2024.
Low oil prices and reduced domestic demand will generate producer price deflation of 0.3% in 2020. As prices for oil and other commodities strengthen, producer price inflation will firm to an annual average of 3.6% in 2021-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates The RBI's adoption of a fairly aggressive loosening stance in 2020, along with a sharp contraction in economic activity, will weigh on the exchange rate. We forecast that the rupee will depreciate by 6% on a nominal annual average basis in 2020, to Rs74.5:US$1, as the domestic economic situation worsens. While a current-account surplus (induced by a sharp fall in imports) will provide some support for the currency, the central bank's efforts to build up foreign-exchange reserves will more than offset it.
In 2021 we expect the rupee to appreciate slightly, to an average of Rs74:US$1, as foreign investment returns. The rupee will depreciate in 2022-24 amid rising oil prices and a persistent current-account deficit.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector Lower oil prices and weak domestic demand will contribute to India registering a current-account surplus equivalent to 0.9% of GDP in 2020-the first since 2004. The contraction in merchandise imports is expected to be sharper than that in exports because of the rampant local spread of the virus, leading to weak consumption. However, merchandise imports are expected to rebound in 2021 amid a pick-up in domestic demand, returning the current account to a deficit.
Increased competition from other countries and changing industrial trends will weigh on the pace of growth in India's main service export sectors, particularly business-process outsourcing and information technology. Nevertheless, the services balance will remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, making a positive contribution to the current account. Owing to the large shortfall on merchandise trade, however, the current account will remain in deficit from 2021, averaging the equivalent of 1.2% of GDP in the remainder of the forecast period.
Significant foreign investment into Reliance Jio, a telecommunications operator, will support inward portfolio investment in 2020. However, investment in the overall economy will be depressed in 2020-21. Inward investment will pick up from 2022 as the expanding economy provides opportunities for businesses.

Full text: - Despite Venezuela's socioeconomic collapse and a public health crisis triggered by the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19), The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the civic-military regime led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela to retain power throughout the 2020-24 forecast period. Mr Maduro's position will be supported primarily by his grip over a complex security apparatus and the opposition's lack of de facto power. On this basis, we expect continued deterioration of the economy, sustained outward migration, and a poorer and more violent Venezuela. Despite US sanctions (and their impact on oil production), the Maduro regime has managed internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through its strict control over the security forces.
- The scale of the socioeconomic collapse and the elevated level of political instability will ensure that the Maduro regime continues to be challenged both economically and politically. Low international crude prices, combined with US sanctions on the regime, mean that Venezuela is struggling to place its oil exports abroad. We therefore forecast domestic crude production to average below 400,000 barrels/day in the coming months. Moreover, given that it will lose control of the legislature in 2021, the opposition will be under strong pressure this year to step up its efforts to oust the regime. Mr Maduro will continue to face challenges to maintain the current patronage system and remain in control.
- De facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding. Concurrently, the government has taken measures that have allowed the official exchange rate to float. These measures have so far aided price stability and therefore increase the availability of some basic goods. However, the measures are not a product of economic orthodoxy, but of policy decisions to ensure the regime's survival. We do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that will be required to resolve the economic crisis within the forecast period.

- Venezuela is ranked 82nd of 82 countries in the global business environment rankings for 2020-24, having been in 80th place in the 2015-19 historical period, as the economic crisis deepens despite minor improvements. Reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment are unlikely.

Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: Expansion of interventionist measures, including price controls. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and continue to undermine free competition.
2022-24: Contract rights remain weak, and red tape and ad hoc interventionism continue.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Most attempts to attract investment prove unsuccessful, owing to political and economic instability.
2022-24: Actual investment flows remain low amid ongoing economic volatility. Intellectual property protection and private property rights deteriorate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: Currency controls are weakened, but access to foreign currency remains limited.
2022-24: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, and de facto dollarisation advances. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves as oil prices rise, albeit slowly.
Taxes 2020-21: Risk of further unrest and political instability reduces probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major rise in public spending.
2022-24: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2020-21: Inflation remains high and concerns surrounding economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2022-24: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2020-21: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Past emigration of skilled labour aggravates skills shortages.
2022-24: Labour-market rigidities persist, despite some increase in flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2020-21: Underinvestment in water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts.
2022-24: Investors remain highly cautious of committing to long-term capital projects. Infrastructure deteriorates even further.
Technological readiness 2020-21: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment, but with little interest.
2022-24: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to restrict internet and mobile coverage.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013 proved unsuccessful. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his own popularity plummet as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices, combined with strict sanctions on trade from the US, has plunged the country into a severe economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly (AN). In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature to be in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the AN.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country) has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports, and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$20.9bn in 2018 as the destruction of domestic supply led to increasing import dependence. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates the 2018 current-account surplus to be 3.6% of GDP.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit considers that the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak and diminished oil rents-resulting from existing US sanctions and low international oil prices-present hefty challenges for the survival of the military regime led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV). Owing to the bleak state of its healthcare system, Venezuela faces an uphill battle against the coronavirus, and there is a high risk that the ongoing socioeconomic crisis could evolve into a humanitarian calamity. Social unrest is prevalent; however, protests could intensify in the coming months owing to severe fuel shortages.
Despite these compounding social and economic shocks, we expect Mr Maduro to retain power throughout 2020, ruling over what is becoming a much less populous and much poorer country. Mr Maduro has two main factors working in his favour. First, the opposition led by the head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, has lost the momentum that it held in 2019. Secondly, the regime retains strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces. Although the risks to our forecasts are very high, we assume that this control-together with the complexity of the security apparatus and the recurrent purges within it-will allow the regime to manage internal dissent.
Mr Maduro's recent actions show that he has the upper hand against the opposition. The new electoral council, inaugurated in June, was packed with Mr Maduro's allies, while opposition members loyal to the regime were appointed as heads of two major opposition parties-Primero Justicia and Voluntad Popular. These actions set the stage for rigged parliamentary elections in December, as opposition forces are now effectively disabled. The brazenness of these actions show that Mr Maduro is unperturbed by potential retaliation by the opposition and that political pressure against him is wavering.
Although it is not part of our baseline forecast, we recognise that there is a high risk of some sort of political transition. There are three main paths to this: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We assess the prospect of military action by the US or Colombia as low, and we consider that a negotiated transition would also be difficult. In early March the US outlined a transition framework in which both Mr Maduro and Mr Guaidó would allow a new state council to be created and fresh elections to be held. However, the appointment of Maduro loyalists to the new electoral council demonstrated that this proposal has failed, as trust issues between the two sides are insurmountable.
We believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The regime's main weakness is the fragility of its internal finances. Its patronage system is crucial for sustaining its security apparatus and resisting social unrest. Low international crude prices, US sanctions and the dampening effect of a global recession on workers' remittances will shrink US dollar inflows further. The regime will continue to benefit from funds from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities, but a lack of hard currency could prove fatal to the patronage system and will test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks. The regime's liquidity problems, and a rapidly worsening socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis, could prompt putsch attempts in the near term.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch Legislative elections will take place on December 6th, assuming that Mr Maduro clings to power and that the polls are not cancelled (Mr Maduro has hinted that they could be suspended as a result of the coronavirus pandemic). These elections would be neither free nor fair, and the opposition would lose control of the National Assembly. If the opposition were to secure some sort of political change in 2020, the interim government would pursue deep-seated reforms to the electoral authority and attempt to hold a vote within 12 months of its formation, although achieving this would be a major challenge.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations Mr Guaidó has marshalled strong support from the international community, but efforts by most governments in Latin America to support him have reached an impasse. Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, the US, has instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions and has openly called for the Venezuelan military to accept Mr Guaidó in place of Mr Maduro. The US expects sanctions to put enough pressure on the regime's finances (and therefore on its patronage system) to force Mr Maduro to hold free and fair elections. The US also warned of additional sanctions in the near future; for example, it plans to impose sanctions on diesel imports as early as October. The US administration will remain hawkish in its approach to foreign policy, but we believe that a military intervention is unlikely, given the aversion of the US president, Donald Trump, to such adventurism. Nonetheless, we expect the US to further heighten diplomatic pressure before the next US general election and the next Venezuelan legislative elections, which will take place in November and December respectively. If tensions rise and political violence increases, the possibility of smaller-scale interventions cannot be discounted. Looking ahead, regardless of whether Mr Trump or his opponent, Joe Biden of the Democratic Party, wins the US election (our baseline forecast is for a Biden victory), we expect US sanctions to remain in place owing to strong bipartisan support. That said, efforts to reach a negotiated exit for Mr Maduro would increase under a Biden administration.
Mr Maduro's main global backers are Cuba, Russia, China and-more recently-Iran. Russia is helping Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA, the Venezuelan state-owned oil company) to circumvent US sanctions-in March the Venezuelan assets of Rosneft (a Russian energy firm) were transferred directly to Russia. Nevertheless, Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the financing-amounting to tens of billions of US dollars per year-required to stabilise the economy and secure PDVSA's long-term future. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries, but has had little success in securing finance for investment. If a transition from the regime were to come about, we believe that Russia and China would be willing to work with Mr Maduro's successor to protect their current investments. Iran recently sent 1.5m barrels of petrol to Venezuela in exchange for gold shipments and is helping to repair the Paraguaná oil refinery.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends The Maduro regime will focus on weathering the fuel shortages and containing the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Despite community spread and an accelerating number of Covid-19 cases, Mr Maduro has eased nationwide quarantine measures to some degree. A "7/7" system is currently in place, whereby seven days of more flexible social distancing measures are followed by seven of tighter restrictions. Measures will remain in place over the short to medium term, as Venezuela's health system is simply unprepared to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. The country's medical infrastructure is poor and hospitals face significant shortages of water, soap, medicines and electricity.
Given its potential to ignite large protests, Mr Maduro has taken some steps to alleviate fuel scarcity. In May the regime announced a two-tiered petrol distribution system. Drivers will be subject to a monthly quota of subsidised petrol. When this has been reached, petrol will be available at internationally indexed prices. The quota system seeks to regularise black-market activity so that the regime (rather than a third party) benefits from the gains. Concurrently, the Maduro regime is seeking to switch on domestic gasoline production. On August 21st PDVSA repaired a naphtha reformer, which is now able to produce 17,000 barrels/day (b/d) of gasoline. However, these actions will only work to an extent, as arbitrage opportunities are still possible under the new subsidy system and the domestic gasoline production meets only a slim portion of local demand.
Based on our view that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout our 2020-24 forecast period, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that are required to resolve the economic crisis. De facto dollarisation is expanding; although this was not a tacit goal for the regime, Mr Maduro now welcomes it. Other under-the-radar adjustments are possible in the coming years, as long as these benefit the regime's survival. Such efforts alone are unlikely to bring about economic stability, owing to the absence of a comprehensive microeconomic reform or improvements in the rule of law, and policy predictability will not be forthcoming under the current regime.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy The authorities have not published complete data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect the non-financial public-sector deficit to narrow in 2020, and the public debt/GDP ratio to remain high in the coming years. The sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will curb government spending. The regime relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Money printing will continue to finance the government's deficits in 2020-24. However, in the medium term growing remittance inflows will partly offset the need to monetise budget deficits. We currently assume no debt restructuring in 2020-24. Venezuela's weak fiscal position is complicated by the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing-mainly PDVSA-issued debt and development funds from China-that understates the true size of total public liabilities.
All of the sovereign's outstanding global bonds are in arrears. However, bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy shifts or a change in government. The key PDVSA 2020 bond, which was secured using 50.1% of the shares of Citgo (PDVSA's US subsidiary) as collateral, fell due at end-October 2019 and was not paid. A US court has ruled that PDVSA is an "alter ego" of the Venezuelan government; this will have far-reaching implications, as some international firms are seeking to seize shares of Citgo stock. However, the US considers Citgo to be under the purview of Mr Guaidó, thus currently shielding Citgo assets from seizure by creditors.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy The government's financing needs will force the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) to ramp up money-printing in the short term. Growing dollarisation and a strong contraction in domestic demand slowed hyperinflationary pressures in 2019. However, we expect hyperinflation to return in the coming months, owing to monetisation of large fiscal deficits and severe goods shortages.
Overall, hyperinflation will continue until its underlying causes are addressed. Hyperinflation has quickened the pace of dollarisation of the economy (more than 60% of transactions are now thought to be conducted in US dollars). We believe that Venezuela is heading towards overall de facto dollarisation. Monthly inflation will rise again in the short term and will remain substantial. However, given the effect of dollarisation on price stability, we do not expect a return to the extremely high annual inflation rates of more than 1,000,000% experienced in 2018.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 36.2% in 2019 (and a cumulative contraction of almost 70% since 2013), we expect an additional decline of 30.3% in 2020. The contraction reflects plummeting oil exports and the adverse effects of the government's quarantine measures, which will further dent domestic demand. Fuel scarcity will also hit the non-oil economy indirectly, through a scarcity of inputs and hyperinflation. From a demand-side perspective, the GDP contraction will be driven by falling real incomes and continued mass emigration (which is fuelled by unemployment, violence and social instability).
Low crude prices and weak oil exports will put significant pressure on the country to slash crude production. Venezuela's average break-even price is about US$15-20/barrel. US sanctions on the regime raise the risks involved in dealing with Venezuela, forcing the country to offer a hefty discount on its crude. This means that, at current market prices, Venezuela is making only a limited profit (its oil basket traded at an estimated US$25/b by end-August). The current circumstances have inevitably led to production cuts; oil output fell to 339,000 b/d in July, according to OPEC, from 810,000 b/d in July 2019 and 1.3m b/d in the same month in 2018. We believe that average output will remain below 400,000 b/d over the coming months.
In 2021 we expect the economy to stabilise somewhat (contracting marginally), owing to a stabilisation of domestic demand as social distancing measures are lifted. In 2022 economic growth will return on the back of a surge in oil prices. Despite serious operational problems (such as difficulties in obtaining equipment for repairs or finding qualified staff) and a limited pool of suitable buyers of Venezuelan crude, oil output will recover somewhat in the medium term as producers become more accustomed to the new post-sanctions export markets. Furthermore, relative macroeconomic stability will allow the non-oil economy to recover marginally in the medium term. There are substantial risks to our forecasts, which assume that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout 2020-24. In the event of a transition, there would be upside risks to our medium-term baseline; the degree of improvement would depend on the characteristics of the transition and on the new government's macroeconomic programme.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation Severely reduced domestic supply, constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits will continue to stoke hyperinflation this year. Dollarisation and the regime's heavy restrictions on credit helped to subdue hyperinflation in the second half of 2019. Consumer prices rose by 55.1% month on month in July after two months of relatively low inflation due to the subsiding effects of social distancing measures on demand-side inflationary pressures. However, as the economy reopens inflationary pressures will strengthen, owing to fuel scarcity, price controls and the ramping-up of government money-printing.
In the medium term inflation will remain high for as long as the Maduro regime is in power, given huge fundamental imbalances between supply and demand, and the need for the regime to monetise its fiscal deficits. Weather-related shocks are a perennial risk to the inflation outlook.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates Hyperinflation will sustain bolívar depreciation in 2020. Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency denomination (as in March 2018) or a new currency is a strong possibility, although the exact nature of such a move is hard to forecast. In mid-2019 the regime announced a loosening of currency controls. Although this was a positive move, significant barriers limit access to US dollars via formal means. We still believe that the government will maintain a number of indirect controls on the foreign-exchange market. In this environment, a black-market exchange-rate premium is inevitable. On August 25th the official exchange rate was BsS308,000:US$1, compared with a black-market rate of BsS320,000:US$1. The premium (currently 4%) is small by historical comparison.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector Venezuela will post a small current-account deficit of 1.9% of GDP in 2020, owing to lower oil exports and limited remittance inflows resulting from the global recession. The BCV's official figures for 2017-18 show that Venezuela posted current-account surpluses in this period. In 2019 the collapse of goods export earnings (due to US sanctions on the oil trade) hit the trade balance hard. Nevertheless, based on the latest data, we estimate that the current account remained in surplus owing to growing inflows of workers' remittances and the non-payment of interest on bonded debt (saving in excess of US$5bn in 2019).
We expect the current account to return to surplus in the medium term, averaging 4.4% of GDP in 2022-24. Goods exports will recover as international oil prices increase and the country steps up trade with Asian markets. This recovery will be supported by continued weakness in domestic demand, rising remittances from abroad and the fact that the sovereign will remain in default throughout the forecast period.

Between 1996 and 2011 Italy had a bipolar political system, dominated by a centre-right alliance and a centre-left coalition. Since 2011 the political landscape has become more fragmented, with the break-up of the centre right, the emergence of the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) and a recent splintering of the centre left.

Full text: - The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and the challenges of dealing with its severe economic and social effects mean that a general election in Italy before the end of the parliamentary term in 2023 is unlikely. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the current government coalition dominated by the populist Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) and the centre-left Partito Democratico (PD) to hold together for all or most of the parliamentary term. Given the fragility of the largely pro-European government, which is currently led by Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister, bouts of intense political instability are likely, potentially triggering cabinet reshuffles and variations in the composition of the wider coalition. Over the medium term we expect the pandemic to contribute to the reshaping of Italy's political landscape that began with the 2018 general election, deepening the divide between centre left and right, and consolidating the latter's popular support.

- Italy's business environment score remains broadly unchanged during the forecast period (2020-24), but the country falls by one place in the global ranking. The scores improve slightly for policy towards private enterprise and competition, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, and the labour market, reflecting the impact of modest economic reforms taken by successive governments since late 2011. However, the scores for the macro-economic environment and market opportunities show more marked deteriorations, as we expect the coronavirus crisis to weigh heavily on economic growth, incomes and the public finances for several years at least.

- The near shutdown of the economy for two months and the wider demand-side effects of the pandemic will trigger a recession of 10.8% in 2020. The collapse of tourism, which contributes to 13% of GDP and 15% of total employment, weighs on the outlook. Real GDP growth will rebound in 2021, but a return to pre-crisis levels is unlikely before 2024. Government schemes will cushion the impact on the labour market to a certain extent, but will not prevent a surge in unemployment, which will hinder the recovery. The pandemic will lead to a substantial deterioration in Italy's public finances. We expect the budget deficit to reach 13% of GDP in 2020, and to narrow from 2021 onwards. Public debt will peak at 163% of GDP this year.

Since 2017 the population has begun to decline, falling from 60.7m to 60.6m in 2019, according to the UN's population estimates. We expect the population to continue falling slightly during the forecast period, to 60m in 2024, reflecting the natural decline of the Italian population and lower immigrant inflows.

- Italy is one of the largest and richest markets in Europe, with a population of about 6om. However, growth potential remains limited because the country is a mature consumer market with weak income and population growth prospects. Income levels differ greatly between the north and the south of Italy, with GDP per head in the south only about 46% of that in the north. Demographic trends will have an important impact on spending patterns, with population ageing driving healthcare expenditure.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.

- Our baseline forecast is that Italy's weak demographic profile will act as a substantial brake on real GDP growth, which we expect to average just 0.3% per year in 2020-50 (the long-term forecast period). A more favourable political environment could produce better economic growth performance in the long term, but the chance of improvements in Italy's institutional framework being implemented in the short to medium term is low.

Background: Post-war Italy has been characterised by a weak political structure and, since the 1970s, a declining economic base. Between 1996 and 2011 Italy had a bipolar political system, dominated by a centre-right alliance and a centre-left coalition. Since 2011 the political landscape has become more fragmented, with the break-up of the centre right, the emergence of the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) and a recent splintering of the centre left. Following the 2018 general election M5S and hard-right Lega formed a government led by Giuseppe Conte, but it was highly unstable and undermined Italy's relations with the EU. In an agreement to avert a snap general election in late 2019 M5S and the pro-European centre-left Partito Democratico (PD) formed a new government also led by Mr Conte.
Political structure: Parliament, which comprises two houses with equal powers, is elected for a five-year term. In the event of a political crisis the president, who is elected by parliament for a seven-year term, decides whether to call an election or nominate a prime minister to try to form a government. The president also promulgates laws and may return a law to parliament for reconsideration, but has no power of veto. Executive power lies with the cabinet, which is nominated by the prime minister and approved by parliament. The prime minister cannot dismiss ministers without forming a new government. The legislative system remains unchanged following the rejection in the December 2016 referendum of a reform to reduce the powers of the Senate (the upper house). A new, predominantly proportional electoral system was adopted in October 2017.
Policy issues: The main issues are the management of, and attempts to reduce, Italy's large public debt (which stood at 134.8% of GDP in 2019), safeguarding the banking system and keeping Italy in the euro zone. In 2012 the government, led by Mario Monti, carried out a number of structural economic reforms to improve competitiveness. The process has since stalled. The M5S-Lega government loosened fiscal policy with tax cuts and income support for low earners, and reversed or diluted pension and labour reforms introduced during the euro zone crisis. The new M5S-PD government is forging a more constructive relationship with the EU, helping to reduce government borrowing costs.
Taxation: The top rate of personal income tax is 43%, and social security contributions are high, especially for employers. The corporation tax rate is 24%, reduced in 2017 from 27.5%, but additional regional and municipal taxes, including the regional business tax (IRAP), are levied to fund health services. The basic rate of IRAP is 3.9%. Income earned from most types of financial investment is taxed at 26%. The standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 22%.
Foreign trade: The value of exports of goods (fob) stood at US$510.9bn in 2019 and imports (fob) were worth US$447.1bn. In the same year the current account recorded a surplus of US$58.9bn, or 2.9% of GDP.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance The March 2018 general election yielded a badly fragmented parliament. The centre-right coalition fell short of the roughly 40% of votes needed to win a majority under the most recent electoral law, the so-called Rosatellum 2, coming in at 37%. Within the coalition, the populist, anti-immigration Lega (17.4%) surpassed Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (FI; 14%), which had previously been seen as the leading party on the right, and polled well ahead of the hard-right, post-fascist Fratelli d'Italia (FdI; 4.4%). The election also saw a surge in support for the populist, anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S), which won 32.7% of vote, making it by far the country's largest party. After three months of difficult coalition talks, M5S and the Lega agreed to form a coalition government under the leadership of a technocratic prime minister, Giuseppe Conte. Meanwhile the mainstream centre-left Partito Democratico (PD), under the leadership of Matteo Renzi, won just 18.9% of the vote, an all-time low, leading to Mr Renzi's resignation and the election of a new party leader, Nicola Zingaretti, in March 2019. The PD and its smaller coalition partners won a combined vote share of just 22.3%, and Liberi e Uguale (LeU)-a formation made up of primarily left-wing splinter parties that spun off from the PD in opposition to Mr Renzi's leadership-took 3.4% of the vote. In August 2019 the Lega, led by Matteo Salvini, withdrew from the coalition to try to engineer a snap general election in order to turn his surge in electoral support into seats in parliament, where the Lega is only the third-largest party, behind the M5S and the PD. To avert a snap election, the M5S and the PD, which used to be fierce political opponents, unexpectedly put aside their differences and agreed to form a new coalition government, still led by Mr Conte.

Political outlook: Political stability Mr Conte presides over a fractious coalition. The centre-left PD and the populist M5S formed a new government in September 2019, after the previous coalition between the M5S and the right-wing Lega collapsed. The government relies on the support of two minor parties: the centrist Italia Viva (a splinter group of the PD) and the left-wing Liberi e Uguali.
The government is coming under pressure owing to its uncertain policy response to the coronavirus crisis, which is the result of institutional constraints, lack of fiscal space and political in-fighting within the governing coalition. Trust in the government has declined from a record approval rating of over 60% during the lockdown in April-May to just above 30% currently. Voters are drawing a distinction between the government's handling of the pandemic-supported by more than 70% of Italians-and its handling of the economic recovery, which is supported by 47%.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the M5S-PD coalition to put aside its inherent differences to keep the government in place for all or most of the parliamentary term, which expires in mid-2023. Failure to do so could undermine the effectiveness of the government's response to the pandemic and aggravate Italy's economic difficulties, not least through a spike in government borrowing costs that would be likely to ensue from a government crisis. Most importantly, all governing parties stand to lose from an early vote, making this scenario unlikely at the moment.
There are still considerable risks to the government's survival. The coalition is fragile, with a slim majority in the Senate (the upper house of parliament), and is vulnerable to defections, as happened in M5S in late 2019-early 2020. Over the medium term, an inevitable return to fiscal austerity after the unprecedented stimulus introduced to mitigate the economic effects of the pandemic is also likely to erode support for the government and fuel tensions within the coalition. Against this backdrop, the government is likely to undergo cabinet reshuffles and variations in the composition of the wider coalition. Such bouts of political instability are still likely to trigger speculation of an imminent election and related spikes in government borrowing costs.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Italy is governed by weak, divided executives, generally comprising multiparty coalitions, in which small parties often wield disproportionate power over policy decisions. Under the bicameral parliamentary system, all bills have to be passed in the same form by both houses of parliament in order to be enacted, often resulting in delays and the dilution of measures. This is unlikely to change following the rejection in 2016 of the Renzi government's constitutional reform package, which sought to reduce drastically the legislative powers of the Senate and would have effectively made the parliament quasi-unicameral.
Efficiency may improve in the public administration, but not in the judiciary Red tape and Italy's inefficient judicial system are likely to continue to pose problems for businesses. Modest measures introduced in recent years to increase public-sector accountability and efficiency should help to gradually speed up some bureaucratic procedures, although given entrenched resistance to change within the public administration, the implementation of the reforms approved in 2015 has been slow. In July 2020 the M5S-PD government approved a package of measures (the so-called "simplification decree") aimed at cutting red tape. Attempts by previous governments to reduce bureaucratic procedures have been largely unsuccessful, and Italy still has among the highest levels of red tape in Europe.
A partial reform of the judicial system was undertaken in 2014-16. However, many of the problems facing Italy's judicial system have not been addressed, including a fee system for lawyers that acts as a disincentive to concluding cases swiftly, a lack of specialisation among judges and a highly fragmented court system. The average number of days to resolve a contractual dispute in Italy is more than double that in some other EU member states.
Corruption is still rife in business, judging by the number of corruption scandals revealed in recent years. A bill presented in March 2010 containing measures intended to combat corruption among public officials took almost three years to become law. Since then government action appears to have intensified. In June 2014 the powers of the anti-corruption authority were strengthened, and less than a year later parliament approved another anti-corruption law, including provisions eliminating the minimum threshold for the prosecution of accounting fraud and introducing harsher prison sentences for this offense, as well as for corruption of public officials, embezzlement and mafia association. The M5S-Lega government passed further anti-corruption legislation at end-2018, imposing harsher criminal penalties and public-office bans for graft, and from 2020 applying the statute of limitations only to first-instance trials so that fewer cases are dismissed owing to a lengthy appeals process.
Criminal organisations will continue to pose problems for businesses and deter investment, despite the authorities' efforts to combat extortion and usury, and the arrests of several mafia bosses in recent years.
Political outlook: Election watch The political landscape has changed dramatically since the March 2018 elections. Popular support for M5S has more than halved, from 33% to 16.6%, according to the latest available polls. In contrast, support for the Lega has surged from 17% to 25%, making it the most popular political party in Italy. Support for the PD has remained broadly stable, at about 20%, whereas support for the far-right FdI has more than tripled, from 4% to 14.5%. If elections were held today, a Lega-led right-wing coalition would gain a majority of seats in the parliament.
Under the current electoral law, 37% of the seats in the parliament are distributed with a first-past-the-post voting system and the remainder are distributed with a proportional system to all political parties that exceed a minimum threshold of 3% of votes. The government put forwards a draft bill to change the electoral law to a fully proportional system, raising the minimum threshold of votes to 5%. This proposal would undermine the chances of a right-wing coalition victory at the next election, and we expect it to be adopted before the next general election.
Political outlook: International relations Tensions within the euro zone have risen during the pandemic, and sharp divisions between the north and the south of Europe have re-emerged. On July 21st, after heated talks that lasted 90 hours, EU leaders agreed on a European economic recovery fund, which clears the way for joint debt issuance worth EUR750bn to be channelled to less-developed countries (in a European context) and those hardest hit by the pandemic. About EUR390bn is to be transferred via cash and the remainder through loans.
The deal is a landmark step for the bloc, as it establishes a precedent for the EU to issue debt to fund common needs. Germany's U-turn on joint debt issuance in May was crucial to the success of the fund. The exogenous nature of the coronavirus shock and its asymmetric impact was a powerful argument in support of the proposal. Nevertheless, concessions had to be made to the "frugal four" (Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden), which were joined by Finland, to win their acceptance of the final package.
EU support is vital to mitigate financial stability risks. Italian sovereign bonds are a safe asset only if the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) are willing to act as a lender of last resort for the government. Over the medium term, all existing facilities for providing financial assistance to governments will be conditional on compliance with EU fiscal rules. As the stance of the current government is pro-European and its policies are aligned with EU rules, we expect EU institutions to shield the Italian government from liquidity risks.

Italy's business environment score remains broadly unchanged during the forecast period (2020-24), but the country falls by one place in the global ranking. The scores improve slightly for policy towards private enterprise and competition, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing and the labour market, reflecting the impact of modest economic reforms taken by successive governments since late 2011. However, the scores for the macroeconomic environment and market opportunities show more marked deteriorations, as The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the coronavirus crisis to weigh heavily on economic growth, incomes and the public finances for several years at least.
Despite a modest improvement under the current government, Italy scores poorly for government effectiveness. Following the rejection of constitutional reforms in a referendum at end-2017, institutional reform is off the political agenda for the foreseeable future, although the government has pushed ahead with plans to reduce radically the number of members of parliament. Reforms in 2014-16 failed to resolve entrenched shortcomings in the judicial system. The severe recession triggered by the measures adopted to contain the coronavirus pandemic will make it more difficult to promote investment and employment, and reduce public debt. These issues, as well as repairing weaknesses in the banking sector, remain the biggest policy challenges facing the government in 2020-24. Italy's tax system remains a hindrance to businesses and foreign invest-ment, and evasion remains widespread, despite periodic efforts to clamp down on the phenomenon and improve compliance. Action to encourage bank mergers and support banks' efforts to reduce the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) on their balance sheets has made some progress, but the sector remains vulnerable.

Business environment outlook: Italy's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: Major progress on reforms to improve competition unlikely under new administration led by Giuseppe Conte.
2022-24: Improvements in competition policy will depend on stabilisation of the political environment.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Modest reductions in red tape. Government imposes penalties on foreign firms that collect state incentives and then relocate production to non-EU countries within five years of the incentivised investment.
2022-24: Organised crime, legal complexity and shortcomings in judicial system remain deterrents.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: Quotas and tariffs are in line with EU practice. The Conte government could oppose new EU trade deals. EU focuses on EU-UK trade deal in Brexit negotiations, further bilateral free-trade deals and responding to US tariffs.
2022-24: An EU-US agreement will probably remain elusive. The risk of a euro area break-up, which could lead to capital controls, is low.
Taxes 2020-21: Automatic rise in value-added tax (VAT) rate is averted in 2020, but the new Conte government abandons plans to complete the adoption of a two-rate "flat tax" owing to cost. Introduction of a "digital tax" on foreign multinational firms.
2022-24: Government seeks to implement a diluted corporate and income tax-reduction package.
Financing 2020-21: Bank mergers, recapitalisations and non-performing loan sales make further progress.
2022-24: Banking sector exposure to the Italian sovereign will persist. Mergers of smaller co-operative banks and possible foreign takeovers accelerate, as does the sale of securitised bad loans. Profitability and credit provision remain weak.
The labour market 2020-21: "Citizenship income" remains in place, but the dilution of pension reforms is partly reversed. Reversal of some aspects of 2014-15 labour market reforms in 2018 dampens employment growth.
2022-24: Decentralised private-sector productivity-related pay deals and changes to public-sector contracts face resistance.
Infrastructure 2020-21: Lack of fiscal space and bureaucratic obstacles constrain government plans for higher investment spending.
2022-24: Infrastructure still lags that of other euro area countries, despite some new investment.
Technological readiness 2020-21: Further digitalisation of public services. A preponderance of smaller and family-run firms, as well as high levels of corporate debt, keep research and development (R&D) spending low.
2022-24: Gradually improving economic prospects (as well as Brexit) encourage more information and communications technology graduates to seek work in Italy. Slight improvement in R&D and company-level technology investment.

Our assessment of the macroeconomic environment focuses not on headline real GDP growth (measured in the market opportunities category), but on economic stability and the underlying policy framework, which influence business planning, hiring and investment. Italy's macroeconomic environment score deteriorates in the forecast period, causing its regional ranking to decline by one place. However, because of larger score falls in other countries Italy's global ranking improves by two places. Italy's biggest macroeconomic policy challenge remains reviving investment and economic growth, making it more socially inclusive, while also putting public debt on a sustainable downwards path. Italy's public debt and weak government effectiveness will continue to be a cause for concern for the core euro zone creditor countries, as well as being a risk to the stability of its financial sector.

- Despite some progress, economic reforms have generally been introduced with a lag relative to most other struggling euro zone economies, and implementation remains an issue. Further measures to reverse more than a decade of stagnant productivity growth are unlikely in the current political and economic environment. The containment measures adopted to slow the coronavirus epidemic will cause a severe recession in 2020 and a marked deterioration in Italy's public finances. Weak price growth will also complicate debt reduction as a share of GDP. Demand-side price pressures will remain subdued owing to low global energy prices, labour market slack, and modest wage growth. Low global energy prices and weak domestic demand will keep Italy's current account in surplus during the forecast period. Nevertheless, concerns remain over the erosion of the country's export competitiveness, stagnant productivity and escalating global trade tensions.

Policy towards private enterprise and competition remains an area in which Italy scores poorly compared with its EU peers, reflecting weak implementation and enforcement of competition rules, and inadequate reforms to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the public administration and justice system. Generally, EU directives have been the main drivers of liberalisation in Italy, forcing successive governments (which, regardless of their political leaning, have not instinctively favoured competition) to open up markets in several sectors, notably telecommunications, energy and professional services. In its annual National Reform Programme for 2020 the government identifies service stations and fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks as being in particular need of liberalisation. The powers of the Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) were strengthened and its remit extended to cover the provision of public services in 2010, but political pressure has generally limited effectiveness. This is also true of other watchdogs, including the Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa (Consob), the public authority responsible for regulating the Italian securities market, and the telecoms watchdog, Autorità per le Garanzie nelle Comunicazioni (AGCOM).

- In early June 2020 the Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S)-Partito Democratico (PD) government introduced a decree law containing "urgent measures" aimed at simplifying administrative procedures, eliminating and speeding up bureaucratic obligations, digitalising the public administration, and supporting the green economy and business activity more generally. The immediate aim is to unlock funds to kickstart a range of public contracts, particularly in the construction sector, in the wake of the coronavirus lockdown. It remains to be seen whether the measures will have a noticeable impact. Past reforms aimed at cutting red tape and improving the efficiency of the public administration to boost the economy have had limited success owing to obstacles to implementation of the measures and the inadequate capacity of the public administration at national and local levels.

External constraints will continue to be the main drivers of liberalisation
- An EU directive aimed at empowering the competition authorities of member states to be more effective enforcers of competition rules and ensure the proper functioning of the internal market took effect in January 2019. Member states have until February 2021 to transpose the directive into national law. It will require several amendments to the AGCM's current legal framework but is expected to strengthen the Authority's independence from political interference.
- Weak contract enforcement, few convictions for white-collar crime, and notoriously long court case backlogs will remain a deterrent of foreign direct investment (FDI) and domestic business investment. Improvements introduced in 2014-17 include extended prison sentences for some white-collar crimes such as bribery, the establishment of support offices to reduce the backlog in Italy's Supreme Court and an extension of the statute of limitations for serious crimes. The M5S-PD government has proposed further changes to both the criminal and civil justice systems designed to improve efficiency and speed up court cases. However, political opposition and resistance from the judiciary remain strong, which will hamper implementation.

Further privatisation of major state-controlled companies is unlikely
- The privatisation plan that was re-launched in mid-2015 to highlight Italy's openness to foreign investment and reduce the level of public debt made little progress before the 2018 general election and is unlikely to be revived under the M5S-PD government. Both parties have vigorously opposed the sale of state assets in the past. This means that the planned public offering of the state's remaining 30% stake in the national post office and financial services group, Poste Italiane, and the mooted sale of a 40% stake in Ferrovie dello Stato, Italy's state-owned railway utility group, are unlikely to happen.
- The Cassa Depositi e Prestiti Spa (CDP)-the state-owned development bank-already has sizeable stakes in state-controlled firms, such as the energy conglomerates, Eni and Enel, Italy's electricity transmission company, Terna, and the shipbuilder Fincantieri. We expect the CDP's role in the economy to expand further as it provides support for businesses struggling in the recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.

The positive impact of economic reforms will only be felt incrementally FDI inflows into Italy have generally been low compared with other similarly sized countries, including those such as France that have traditionally been seen as no more open than Italy. The main deterrents to FDI in Italy relate to complex bureaucratic and legal procedures, barriers to entry in areas of the services sector, inadequate infrastructure, high levels of taxation and energy costs, and labour market rigidities. Under past governments labour market reforms, modest business tax cuts and streamlining of Italy's complex tax system have begun to address some of these issues. However, given the Italian economy's long-standing structural deficiencies and the likelihood that the impact of recent reforms will be felt only incrementally, inward FDI in Italy will continue to lag that in other large EU member states. In March 2019 Italy became the first G7 country to sign a Memorandum of Understanding to participate in the Belt and Road Initiative-China's flagship global infrastructure integration plan. Chinese investors signed 29 separate deals for projects worth a total of EUR2.5bn, including investment in Italy's port infrastructure in Trieste, Genoa, and Palermo, which could give Chinese firms faster access to Europe. However, hardening sentiment at the EU level towards foreign takeovers and non-EU inward FDI-with a particular focus on inflows from China-has resulted in a steady tightening of regional investment screening provisions since 2017. The economic fallout from the pandemic is likely to spur increased scrutiny at the EU level, with Italy having extended domestic restrictions on acquisitions to cover banks, insurers, healthcare and energy.

- Judicial reforms should gradually improve contract enforcement, with signs that those introduced in 2014-17 are already reducing civil case backlogs. Although less ambitious than hoped for, anti-corruption legislation introduced since 2013 represents a further sign of intent to improve the operating environ-ment for domestic and overseas investors. Legislation passed in 2015 and banks' progress in recent years in reducing NPLs should encourage further financial sector consolidation, which could eventually attract FDI into the banking sector, although progress is likely to be slow owing to political resistance.

Foreign takeovers, especially of luxury goods brands, are likely to continue
- The 2011-14 economic downturn hit corporate balance sheets and Italian firms' ability to raise capital. As a result, foreign companies acquired or merged with a rising number of internationally renowned Italian corporate brands, particularly in the luxury and consumer goods sectors, such as Bulgari, Valentino, Loro Piana and Luxottica. The coronavirus-induced recession is likely to weigh heavily on firms' balance sheets and equity valuations, so there is likely to be renewed foreign interest in acquisitions of Italian companies.

Italy's score in this category improves slightly in the forecast period, leading to large improvements in its global and regional ranking, owing to deteriorations or stagnation elsewhere. Italy's foreign trade regime is largely defined by its EU membership. Freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and persons exists within the bloc and we do not expect any exchange controls. However, there is a risk of further temporary border closures and travel restrictions within the Schengen area in the case of a second wave of coronavirus infections across Europe. No tariffs or quotas are permitted within the EU, most non-tariff restrictions have been abolished and administrative costs related to cross-border trade are low. Bilateral trade disputes between EU countries are resolved by the European Commission or, in extreme cases, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the jurisprudence of which has played a major role in developing the single market. Compliance with judicial or other rulings within the EU is higher than in other regional trading blocs or the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Trade with Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland is unrestricted under the European Free-Trade Association (EFTA). The EU also has a customs union with Turkey and a range of bilateral agreements with Switzerland. All of these arrangements exclude agriculture. Trade with other non-EU countries is mostly subject to moderate customs duties, with bilateral and regional agreements providing for lower or zero tariffs, as well as co-operation on non-tariff barriers.
The EU will focus on bilateral trade deals
- Amid a fraying multilateral trade system and opposition in many countries (notably the US) to further trade liberalisation, the EU's focus will remain on bilateral trade deals. However, progress will be constrained by a weakened and more volatile global trading environment over the forecast period. The global recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 is likely to exacerbate many existing geopolitical trends, such as increasing US-China frictions, a rise in nationalist anti-globalist policies and the shift in the economic balance of power from West to East. This implies an increasing risk of a rise in EU-US trade tensions and a more challenging backdrop in which to manage EU-China relations. Over the medium term these pressures could encourage increased trade diversification amid increased recognition of the risks of supply-chain overreliance on a single market (such as China).

Trade deals between the EU and other trade blocs will be implemented gradually
- In recent years the EU has finalised free-trade agreements (FTAs) with Canada, Singapore, Vietnam and Japan, upgraded its FTA with Mexico and launched trade talks with Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand. In mid-2019 the EU and Mercosur (the South American trading bloc comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) reached an agreement in principle to create the world's largest free-trade market of almost 800m people, after 20 years of talks. Phased-in measures will aim to eliminate about 90% of tariffs and provide greater access to agricultural and services markets, and to public procurement contracts, from 2021 at the earliest. However, the deal needs to be ratified in national parliaments (which will be a politically complex process, given opposition in some EU member states).

The impact of a "hard Brexit" on Italy is likely to be only moderate
- The UK officially left the EU at end-January 2020 and the increasing possibility of the transition period ending with no deal in December will put a further dampener on the near-term trade outlook in Europe. Negotiation of a substantive EU-UK free-trade deal by end-2020 was ambitious prior to the coronavirus outbreak, and such an outcome is now highly unlikely, especially given the UK government's strong ideological stance over Brexit. The negative impact of a "hard Brexit" will primarily be felt in the UK, but an increase in tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade will also inflict damage on its trading partners in Europe. Italy's direct exposure through trade and investment links is relatively limited compared with some other EU countries. However, the UK is Italy's fifth-largest export market, accounting for 5% of the total value of Italian goods exports.

Italy's tax system remains highly complex, so compliance is costly Italy's score for taxation improves in the forecast period, but the country ranks third from last in our global ranking and bottom in our regional ranking in 2020-24. Notwithstanding some streamlining under previous governments, the tax system remains complex, making compliance costly and time consuming for private-sector companies. Also, despite some modest tax cuts since 2014 and measures such as tax payment deferrals during the coronavirus crisis, the tax burden will remain high and is unlikely to decline much owing to Italy's high public debt and EU sovereign debt reduction requirements. Tax policy will remain uncertain, as the M5S-PD government plans to introduce further changes in 2021, the nature of which is as yet unclear.

- According to Istat (the national statistics office), total tax revenue/GDP (including social security contributions) stood at 42.4% in 2019-slightly higher than in 2018, but broadly in line with the euro zone average (41.7% in 2018, latest data). According to Eurostat data, Italy has the third-highest implicit tax rate on labour in the EU (aggregate tax revenue from labour as a percentage of the potential tax base), after Slovakia and Greece. This was 42.7% in 2018 (latest available data), down from a high of 44.2% in 2013, but 4.5 percentage points above the euro zone average. At 15.7% in 2018, Italy's implicit tax rate on consumption was one of the lowest in the EU, highlighting that there is scope to shift taxation towards consumption and away from labour.

Despite promises to reduce labour taxes, they will remain high
- Italy's standard rate of corporate tax is 24%, after a cut of 3.5 percentage points in 2017. In addition to a corporate tax rate, businesses also pay a regional business tax (IRAP), which is levied at a standard rate of 3.9% (and slightly higher than this for most financial institutions). However, the central government can raise the rate as high as 4.4% in regions running budget deficits. Regions and municipalities also apply personal income surtaxes at varying rates to offset the impact of cuts in transfers from the central government, which have been an almost constant feature of budget adjustments in recent years. Companies pay social security contributions at a high rate, by international comparison, of 30% (9.5% for employees). These are unlikely to be reduced significantly unless pension spending, which amounts to about 15% of GDP (one of the highest rates in Europe), is significantly reduced. Currently the marginal personal income tax rate is 43% on gross annual incomes of more than EUR75,000.
- Some progress has been made in reducing tax evasion and avoidance in Italy since the 2013 crisis, but it remains widespread, encouraged in the past by frequent tax amnesties, the limited number and scope of inspections, and weak political will to close loopholes in tax laws. Governments have sought to encourage the use of electronic payments rather than cash, but their approach has been inconsistent, with stipulated limits on the maximum payments you can make in cash undergoing frequent changes. The M5S-Lega government raised the limit from EUR1,000 to EUR3,000 in 2019 and indicated that it wanted to abolish the limit altogether. The M5S-PD government has recently lowered it to EUR2,000, effective from July 1st 2020.

Fragmentation remains one of the main weaknesses of the banking sector Italy's score and global ranking improve in the forecast period, reflecting the impact of a range of measures adopted by recent governments to encourage consolidation in the banking sector, support recapitalisation and tackle the issue of high NPLs. Nevertheless, the country still ranks below most other developed countries, which largely reflects delays in introducing reforms to address the Italian banking sector's weaknesses after the 2008-09 global crisis. The sector's main shortcomings are fragmentation, with few large banks and many small and medium-sized lenders; high operating costs, because of excessive branch networks and personnel costs; low profitability; uncertainty about the quality of supervision; and heavy exposure to the sovereign, which leaves them vulnerable when concerns about government-debt sustainability increase. NPLs have declined considerably in recent years, but are still high, at 6.7% of total credit as at end-2019. This is well down from 16.9% in the third quarter of 2015, but more than double the EU average of 2.7%. Much of the decline is the result of large NPL securitisation operations by a few major Italian banks. The reduction of the high levels of NPLs on the balance sheets of Italy's smaller banks has made slower progress. Perhaps with a view to supporting these banks' efforts, the government has extended the system of guarantees (Garanzia sulle cartolarizzazioni delle sofferenze, or GACS) until May 2021. Progress towards consolidation in the sector has been slow, but the takeover bid launched in February 2020 by Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy's second largest bank, for UBI Banca, the sixth largest, suggests that a new wave of bank mergers and acquisitions is likely during the forecast period. The stress tests carried out by the European Banking Authority on Italy's four major banks (Intesa Sanpaolo, UniCredit, Banco Bpm and UBI Banca) in 2018 highlighted the improved health of Italy's banks compared with the EBA's stress tests in 2016. The next round of EU-wide stress tests due in 2020 has been pushed back to 2021 to allow banks to focus on their response to the coronavirus outbreak.

- The resilience of the financial sector will be severely tested by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. An array of policy support by the ECB, as well as domestic stimulus measures by the government and the Bank of Italy (the national central bank) will help to bolster liquidity and hold down banks' funding costs. However, a slump in economic output, weaker demand for credit, an increase in loan losses amid higher unemployment and business failures, a period of increased global financial market volatility and a continuing squeeze on profitability from record-low interest rates will put pressure on lenders' balance sheets, potentially exposing areas of weakness and reducing their capacity to provide credit as the economy gradually recovers. Italy's large number of small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to rely largely on bank borrowing for financing.

Recent reforms will reduce long-standing rigidities only gradually Italy's global ranking improves by one place in the forecast period, but the labour market category remains an area in which Italy performs poorly, especially compared with its EU peers. The Jobs Act legislative package that was passed in 2014-15 was a welcome development, but because the main reforms only applied to new private-sector hires, it will only reduce long-standing rigidities gradually. Having promised to dismantle the Jobs Act, the M5S-Lega government made limited changes to its so-called Dignity Decree. Restrictions on the use of easily terminated fixed-term contracts were tightened, allowing them to be used for up to 24 months, compared with 36 months under the Jobs Act. It also required firms to provide a justification for the use of such contracts, which is likely to increase litigation, and pay an additional levy of 1.9% (up from 1.4%) when they extend a fixed-term contract. However, the cap of 20% of the workforce on temporary contracts for an individual firm remained unchanged. The decree also raised the minimum compensation for unfair dismissal from four months' salary to six months' and from a maximum of 24 months' salary to 36.

- Other measures introduced under the Jobs Act that remain intact include reduced employment protection for long-term contracts and a much simplified contract system for labour market entrants by introducing a standard open-ended employment contract with gradually increasing protection. The Jobs Act also increased the availability of unemployment benefits and streamlined the use of wage guarantee funds for temporary lay-offs or firm restructuring. In 2018 the new national agency envisaged under the Jobs Act to co-ordinate the activities of all employment services providers became operative.
- The shortcomings that persist in the Italian labour market leave it particularly vulnerable to severe disruption as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Given the scale of economic damage and the time-limited nature of state-backed schemes to protect jobs, the level of unemployment will rise sharply as support is withdrawn. The effects are likely to show significant variations across different sectors of the economy, with tourism, travel and hospitality among the worst hit. Low-skilled, low-paid and temporary contract workers are also likely to be the worst affected.
- In view of a protracted recession, delayed reforms and a weak economic recovery in 2014-19, Italy's headline jobless rate was relatively high even before the coronavirus pandemic hit. At 9.9% in 2019, the unemployment rate was well above the euro area average of 7.6%. Youth unemployment remains high, despite increased emigration of young people, especially graduates. At 29.2%, the youth unemployment rate is the third highest in the euro area, where the average rate is 15.8%. Despite some improvement in recent years, Italian labour market participation remains low, particularly among women and young people. According to Eurostat, Italy's employment rate was 59.1% in 2019, compared with the euro area average of 68.1%. The female employment rate was 50.1% (63.1% in the euro area).
- In 2018 Italy's three main trade union confederations and the business association, Confindustria, agreed a new national wage bargaining framework. It provides the basis for sectoral accords at the national level, as well as second-level plant or regional agreements linking wage increases to company performance and productivity gains. The M5S-Lega government made the introduction of a national minimum wage a policy priority, but failed to legislate for it before the government collapsed. The M5S's flagship citizenship income scheme, which aims to reduce poverty, was established in 2019. There are concerns that it will act as a disincentive for people out of work to search for employ-ment, resulting in higher structural unemployment.

Infrastructure quality in the south will continue to lag the rest of the country As reflected in the decline in Italy's regional and global rankings, the quality of Italy's infrastructure is set to remain below the average of other developed countries during the forecast period. A significant disparity between the north and the south of the country will also continue. Budgetary constraints have limited public investment in the past 25-30 years, and local interest groups have succeeded in blocking or delaying several major projects in the transport and energy sectors. Corruption investigations are another relatively common reason for delays. As illustrated by the collapse of the Morandi motorway bridge in Genoa in August 2018, maintenance of existing infrastructure also remains an issue. However, the reconstruction of the bridge in record time (it reopened in late July 2020) highlights that when there is political will to overcome bureaucratic obstacles there is ample scope for improvement in Italy's performance. Italy continues to lag most other developed countries in these markets, and the rollout of high-speed broadband services has been slow.

- Successive governments have promised to revive public capital spending by curbing current spending, freeing up funds earmarked for infrastructure projects and removing administrative obstacles that have held up investments. However, Italy's high debt servicing costs, combined with competing demands within coalition governments, make a radical change in policy direction unlikely. M5S has actively opposed the continued construction of the high-speed rail link through the Alps, from Turin in the north east of Italy to Lyon, a major city in south-eastern France, putting the completion of the project in doubt.

Fiscal consolidation will hold back public investment in infrastructure
- Limited domestic energy sources and popular opposition to the development of nuclear-power generation will continue to cause uncertainty about security and diversification of supply. Poor infrastructure in energy distribution is likely to keep upward pressure on costs. Investment will also continue to face strong local resistance.
- Building a high-speed broadband network across the country has been a policy priority of successive governments in Italy for several years. Progress has been extremely slow so far, but the current government's focus on the need to accelerate the digitalisation of the public administration may provide some much-needed momentum. Central to the government's plan has been Open Fiber, a wholesale broadband operator that is jointly owned by Enel and CDP. Open Fiber expects to build fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) networks in 270 cities in Italy by 2023. The government wants Open Fiber and Telecom Italia to merge their network assets to accelerate the roll-out of the network and avoid unnecessary duplication, but the talks between the two companies have been fractious, making the merger unlikely.

Italy's technology readiness score deteriorates in the forecast period compared with the historical period, thereby contributing to falls in both our global and regional rankings. E-commerce is growing rapidly (up by 18.4% year on year in value terms in 2019 and by 17.2% in the first quarter of 2020, according to Istat), reflecting improvements in the online environment. However, growth has been from a low base, with online purchases accounting for less than 10% of retail sales (compared with about 20% in the UK).

- Mobile-phone penetration is one of the highest in Europe, and take-up of new technologies such as smartphones and high-speed mobile contracts has usually been impressive. Spending on innovation, and research and development (R&D) is low for a developed economy, largely reflecting a preponderance of smaller and family-run firms, high levels of corporate debt, and limited public financial support. According to OECD data for 2018, total R&D spending (for both the public and private sectors) was the equivalent of 1.4% of GDP (compared with an OECD average of 2.4%).

Digitalisation of public services is a policy priority
- The implementation of the 2017-19 Plan for the Digital Transformation of the Public Administration has facilitated some progress. The M5S-PD government has made further progress a priority in its Action Plan 2025.
- We expect a slight improvement in R&D and firm-level technology investment, partly supported by the tax credit for R&D investment in effect since mid-2015, but growth will be from a low base. According to the European Patent Office, the number of patent applications in Europe originating in Italy increased by just 1.2% in 2019, compared with average growth in Europe of 4%, and only accounted for 2% of the total. Relative to population size, patent applications in Italy were low, at just 71 per million population, ranking Italy just 19th-well behind other major European economies such as Germany, France and the UK.

Economic forecast: Policy trends Italy has gone from the worst-hit country in Europe to a model of virus suppression. The government has been successful in keeping the spread of the virus under control. Although about 35,000 people have died since the start of the pandemic and Italy remains among the countries with the highest number of deaths per million people in the world (586), the number of active cases has decreased gradually to about 15,000-one of the lowest in Europe. According to a 14-day sum measure published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), as at mid-August the number of cases per 100,000 people in Italy is 9.7. As a point of comparison, there are currently 140 cases per 100,000 people in Spain, 45.7 in France, 20.7 in the UK and 16.6 in Germany. The rate of positive tests has also remained low (below 3%) by international standards, meaning that Italy performs many tests relative to the size of the outbreak.
The economy has been reopening gradually under new safety rules since May 4th. Following one of the most stringent lockdowns in Europe in March-May (which comprised the shutdown of all commercial activities for eight weeks and factories for two), manufacturing and construction reopened on May 4th. Retail shops, restaurants, cafés and hairdressers opened on May 18th, followed by sports facilities on May 25th, and cinemas and theatres on June 15th. On June 3rd the government lifted restrictions on freedom of movement between regions and on tourism from other EU member states and the UK. To prevent a spike in new infections, especially among young people, on August 16th the government re-imposed some restrictions for the first time since the end of the lockdown. Clubs will remain closed for three weeks and it is now compulsory to wear a mask outdoors between 6PM and 8AM.
In March the government adopted a major stimulus package ("Cura Italia") worth EUR25bn to boost healthcare capacity (EUR3.2bn); support the income of employees and self-employed individuals (EUR10.3bn); help businesses with tax deferrals and other measures (EUR6.4bn); and support credit provision (EUR5.1bn). A second package was adopted in April ("Liquidity Decree") to deploy state guarantees of up to EUR400bn (25% of GDP). A third package was adopted in May ("Relaunch Decree") to provide an additional EUR55bn to boost household incomes (EUR14.5bn), further strengthen the national healthcare system (EUR3.3bn), and support businesses with subsidies and tax deferrals (EUR16bn). In early August the government adopted a new EUR25bn package to extend income support for households and provide further funding for temporary unemploy-ment schemes until year-end. Other important measures include the extension of the moratorium on debt repayments for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the deadline to pay back tax obligations.

Government debt 134.8 163.4 158.7 157.2 156.2 155.6
The coronavirus outbreak will lead to a substantial deterioration in the public finances. We forecast that the budget deficit will expand to 13% of GDP in 2020, from 1.6% in 2019. About 6% of GDP of this deficit results from the measures taken by the government to stimulate the economy, and the remainder stems from the adverse impact of the recession. We forecast that the debt/GDP ratio will increase by about 27 percentage points this year, reaching over 163%.
Asset purchases from the European Central Bank (ECB) will continue to mitigate risks to financial stability, shielding Italy's sovereign debt from liquidity problems in 2020. The ECB's ultra-dovish monetary policy stance will keep the government's borrowing costs low, which is important given Italy's heavy debt load. A sovereign debt default is therefore unlikely in the near term. Moreover, government bonds are mostly held domestically.
The budget deficit will start to shrink again next year owing to a rebound in economic activity and following the expiration of the stimulus measures adopted by the government. GDP will nonetheless remain below its pre-crisis trend level throughout our forecast period (2020-24), leading to a structural shortfall in tax revenue. As a consequence, we forecast that the budget deficit will average 3.9% of GDP in 2022-24, and public debt will stabilise just below 157% of GDP. Although EU fiscal rules have been temporarily suspended, a multi-year fiscal adjustment will be required over the medium term.

The ECB has deployed an arsenal of policy weapons to limit the financial and economic fallout from the public health crisis. In addition to the open-ended quantitative-easing (QE) programme and negative interest rates, several crisis tools have been brought into play.
Among the most effective is the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), designed to be temporary and flexible, allowing the ECB to expand its sovereign bond holdings, front-load purchases and take more risk onto its balance sheet (by buying short-term corporate debt of sufficient quality and Greek government bonds). Starting with an initial size of EUR750bn, the PEPP was recently boosted to EUR1.35trn (10% of euro zone GDP) and extended until mid-2021. At its current pace of EUR30bn per week, the PEPP will be exhausted by February 2021. Although the ECB could slow the rate of purchases, another boost to the programme's size remains possible.
The ECB has also preserved an ample degree of liquidity in the banking system. First, it made some refinancing operations cheaper-the interest rate for longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) was lowered to -1%-and others more accessible for non-bank financial intermediaries. Second, it eased the rules around the collateral that banks can use in exchange for central bank liquidity, effectively preventing a wave of asset-price devaluations from constraining bank lending to the economy.

Economic forecast: Economic growth The impact of the coronavirus: global and regional assumptions The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecasts are built on a series of epidemiological assumptions about the novel coronavirus (Covid-19). Without rapid access to a vaccine, we expect that the disease will eventually infect up to 30% of the world's population; of the symptomatic cases, we assume that about 15% will be severe and up to 1% will prove fatal. Death ratios will depend on a country's ability to detect, track and contain the virus, and the capacity of the national health system. Governments are lifting restrictions on freedom of movement gradually in countries where the number of cases is falling. Some countries may be forced to re-impose measures if cases spike again. Based on previous viral outbreaks and the progress made on other coronavirus vaccines (such as that for severe acute respiratory syndrome-SARS), we expect a vaccine to be available by end-2021.
We forecast that global real GDP will contract by 5% year on year in 2020. We believe that trade disruptions will remain severe and forecast that global trade will contract by 22.6% this year. We assume that oil prices will decline by about 37% this year, to average US$40.5/barrel, before they recover to US$45/b next year. Real GDP will contract in all regions this year, but the drop in output will be especially severe in OECD countries, at 6.3%. All G7 countries and all but two G20 countries (China and Indonesia) will experience a full-year recession, and the US's output will contract by 5.3%, while China will record real GDP growth of 1.4%. Asian countries will recover the fastest, with some (including India and South Korea) returning to pre-coronavirus GDP levels in 2021. Of the G7 countries, Germany's output will also be back to 2019 levels in 2021, but others will recover more slowly, with GDP returning to 2019 levels in either 2022 (Canada, France and the US), 2023 (the UK) or 2024 (Italy and Japan). Most countries have responded with fiscal programmes to support businesses and households, raising the risk of sovereign debt crises in the medium term. Central banks have cut interest rates and, more importantly, have stepped up as buyers of last resort for government and corporate debt.
Europe is heading for a historic recession, with both production and consumption collapsing in the first half of 2020 as a result of the pandemic and containment measures. We forecast a bounce-back from the third quarter, but this will reflect base effects rather than a robust return of economic activity. Global supply chains will remain disrupted, unemployment and business failures will continue to rise and consumers will remain cautious. Southern Europe, which depends on tourism, will take longer to recover as quarantines and weak confidence deter holidaymakers. We expect the economic bounce-back in Europe to lag the global average and do not expect real GDP to recover to its 2019 level until 2023. Variations across the bloc will be determined by factors such as starting positions, the fiscal response, economic structure and export dependencies. Germany will be the first major European economy to recover, and Italy the last.
The political and geopolitical effects of the crisis will be significant. The pandemic has resulted in an extraordinary expansion of executive powers, with limited parliamentary oversight. Elections have been cancelled or delayed in some countries. When the pandemic has passed, governments' handling of the response will face scrutiny. Failure to address the humanitarian crisis triggered by the coronavirus could further erode trust in national institutions. A severe global economic crisis, followed by large-scale unemployment, could fuel a new wave of popular protests. The crisis may encourage support for the nation state, and a backlash against globalisation and open borders. It will also intensify the competition for global leadership between China and the US, and a realignment of geopolitical spheres of influence may ensue in Europe, Africa and other regions.

We expect the Italian economy to contract by 10.8% this year, as a result of the supply- and demand-side shock stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. Although there is a higher than usual degree of uncertainty around the exact outturn, it will be substantially worse than the 5.3% contraction in 2009 following the global financial crisis. As expected, the most severe damage to the economy so far took place in the second quarter, which contained six of the eight weeks that the country was in lockdown. Output declined by 12.4% in the second quarter of 2020, following a contraction of 5.4% in the previous three months.
The gradual lifting of the lockdown since May has helped to revive confidence and lift economic activity from the trough registered in April. The 12.5% month-on-month increase in retail sales in June followed a jump of 25.1% in May. Nonetheless, in year-on-year terms, this was still equivalent to a fall of 3.1%. Uncertainty will continue to lead households to increase their precautionary savings and businesses to delay investments. Consumers may continue to self-quarantine even after the government has lifted travel restrictions for fear of contr-acting the coronavirus. The impact on external demand is also likely to be long-lasting, particularly in the tourism industry, as foreign travellers may be reluctant to visit Italy even after the pandemic has been contained.
As the extraordinary measures adopted to tackle the coronavirus pandemic have been eased gradually since May and demand conditions have improved, activity in Italy's industrial sector has recovered strongly, having collapsed in March-April. However, output remains well below the levels recorded in 2019 or even at the start of 2020. In January-June calendar-adjusted industrial output declined by an average of 18.3% year on year. Italy's export-oriented industries posted the largest declines on an annual basis. Even assuming further increases in output in the third quarter, the industrial sector will post a large full-year contraction in 2020.
We expect a rebound in activity from the third quarter, but this will mainly reflect strong base effects, with consumers and firms still behaving cautiously. Sporadic containment measures may need to be used to keep the outbreak under control until a vaccine becomes available for public use, which we expect to be in late 2021. Moreover, the recovery will remain vulnerable to a recent new spike in infections around Europe, which could lead to the re-imposition of local lockdowns in Italy in the coming months. We expect a partial recovery in the economy in 2021, with growth of 6%. However, we do not expect real GDP to return to its end-2019 level until late 2024.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends The 2008-o9 global financial crisis and the subsequent euro area crisis had a severe impact on the Italian industrial sector. As a consequence, in 2019 industry (excluding construction) accounted for 23.9% of nominal gross value added, compared with 26.5% of gross value added in 2007, and 21.9% of employment, up slightly from 21.8% in 2007. The manufacturing sector has long been the main strength of the Italian economy, especially Italy's family-owned small and medium-sized export-oriented companies specialising in products that require high-quality design and engineering. However, the sector faces major challenges owing to Italy's structural problems, and concerns about the global economic outlook stemming from the lingering effects of the coronavirus pandemic on global trade, the ongoing trade war between the US and China, and rising trade tensions between the EU and the US. Our outlook for world trade volumes foresees an annual collapse of 22.6% in 2020, followed by an only partial recovery of 11.9% in 2021. In addition, the free-trade model that has dominated global trade discussions in recent decades is clearly in retreat. Italy and its biggest trading partner, Germany, are exposed not only to the trade protectionism that the US administration has brought to bear on China, but also to the threat of US tariff increases on EU exports. Regardless of the result of the US presidential election in November 2020, we expect US-China frictions to continue, especially over questions of technology, investment and finance.
Italian industry faces major challenges owing to structural deficiencies In 2019 manufacturing accounted for 16.6% of gross value added, down from 17.8% in 2007 and 20.3% in 1997. The sector's decline has largely been driven by the prolonged weakness of domestic demand, but also by the difficulties that Italian exporters face in remaining competitive within the European single currency area. Unit labour costs have remained well above the euro area average since 2005 and have continued to rise in Italy since 2010, whereas they have fallen in other peripheral euro area economies such as Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Weak competitiveness and further transfers of low-value-added production out of Italy are likely to lead to a further decline in manufacturing's contribution to the economy during the forecast period.
The automotive industry is one of the flagship sectors of Italian industry. It accounts for about 8% of GDP-almost a quarter of the contribution from all manufacturing industries and about 10% of the total value of Italian exports. Fiat (Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino), which was renamed Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) in 2014 after merging with a US-based producer, is the dominant producer in Italy, but the sector also comprises hundreds of firms that manufacture components or provide related services.
After declining in 2008-13, vehicle production in Italy picked up by 6% in 2014 and 45.3% in 2015, slowed to 8.8% in 2016 and 3.5% in 2017, and contracted by 7.2% in 2018 and 13.9% in 2019. At 900,000 units at end-2019, annual production is still well below its 2007 levels. The drop in Italian production disproportionately affected passenger-car output. In 2013 passenger-car output was more than 70% lower than in 2000. Following a modest increase of 3% in 2014, Italian passenger-car production rose by 65% in 2015, before moderating to 7.5% in 2016 and 4.2% in 2017, and then contracting sharply in 2018 and 2019, by 9.3% and 19.5% respectively. Passenger-car production and sales suffered last year, mainly owing to the introduction of new EU emissions standards that distorted industry statistics. We expect vehicle output to fall again this year as coronavirus-related lockdowns slashed demand for motor vehicles in Europe during the first half of 2020 and forced most automakers in the region to halt production temporarily. In mid-July the Italian government announced purchase incentives for low-emission cars, and hybrid and electric vehicles (EVs). From August to December this year buyers of Euro 6 vehicles costing less than EUR40,000 will receive a subsidy of EUR3,500, instead of EUR1,500 previously, if they trade in cars older than ten years. Pure EVs costing less than EUR61,000 will also get a discount of EUR6,000, compared with EUR4,000 earlier. However, we expect passenger-car sales to plummet by 28.2% in 2020, and the commercial-vehicle market will shrink by 23.5%. The outlook for the new-vehicle market in Italy is also subdued for the rest of our forecast period.
Fiat's strategy to become a major global player has proved challenging Fiat's strategy to become a major global producer through mergers, acquisitions and alliances abroad is proving challenging and will probably not boost production in Italy, even if it is successful. The company has succeeded in raising margins globally, but has set ambitious targets through to 2022, which will be all the more difficult to fulfil following the sudden departure and death of Sergio Marchionne, the firm's iconic chief executive officer since 2004, in late July 2018. Given Italy's high labour costs and other difficulties of doing business in the country, the recent trend of shifting automotive production out of Italy is likely to continue, despite FCA's repeated promise to increase domestic production. Fiat now produces about two-thirds of its vehicles abroad, in China, Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Serbia, Poland and elsewhere. It closed its Termini Imerese plant in Sicily at the end of 2011 and began producing cars at a new plant in Serbia in the first half of 2012. Integration with Chrysler could also result in more production being transferred to plants outside Italy.
Manufacturing sector performance will depend on the speed of reforms In the medium term the performance of the manufacturing sector will depend largely on the implementation of reforms to tackle Italy's structural deficiencies. These include issues such as a lack of competition, particularly in the non­tradeable services sectors and utilities. This has meant that companies in Italy pay high prices for domestically produced inputs, such as electricity, compared with competitors elsewhere. The predominance of small companies and their lack of investment in areas such as innovation, and research and development (R&D) has prevented them from moving up the value-added chain. There are about 388,000 manufacturing companies in Italy, about 97% of which employ fewer than 50 people. Firms with fewer than ten employees account for about 82% of the total.
Italian SMEs are often aggregated within sector-specific industrial districts, which, through a combination of co-operation and competition, help to mitigate the impact of the difficulties arising from a lack of expansion. Italian SMEs have begun to consolidate under the pressure of intense competition and the global financial crisis. However, the availability of domestic funds to support mergers or recapitalisations to start new projects is likely to be curtailed by the need to reduce the government debt burden.
Construction sector activity is likely to remain subdued in 2020 Activity in the construction sector accounted for 4.3% of gross value added in 2019-down marginally from 2016, but well below an annual average of 6% of gross value added in 2006-09-and 6.2% of employment in 2016, compared with 8.6% in 2007. After nine full-year contractions, which left output in the sector about a third below its 2006 peak in real terms, the decline appeared to bottom out in the final quarter of 2015. However, activity is likely to remain subdued during the forecast period, reflecting the impact of an eight-year decline in property prices up to 2016, as well as the coronavirus pandemic (construction contracted by 5.6% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2020). The pandemic will weigh on recovery in the construction sector, as will ongoing corruption investigations involving public works contracts. Various govern-ments have sought to accelerate EU co-financed infrastructure investment plans to provide some support to the sector, but little progress is likely to be made, largely owing to delays at the regional and ministerial levels.
Services will be significantly disrupted by the pandemic Already accounting for 74% of gross value added, the services sector will be significantly disrupted by the pandemic. The hotel and restaurant sector will be the worst affected, along with other services related to tourism. The retail sector will also suffer in the short term. In contrast, the information and communications technology (ICT) sector will benefit from the increase in remote working, and we expect a continued rise in its share of real value added. Sectors that serve mainly the domestic market and have so far enjoyed a high level of protection from competition will come under pressure as a result of reforms to reduce barriers to entry, but this is likely to be only gradual. Over the near term, the Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S)-Partito Democratico (PD) government is unlikely to embark on ambitious service sector liberalisations and would be more likely to introduce protective legislation. High-value­added services sectors, such as design, which are closely tied to clothing, textiles and automotive, Italy's main export sectors, should continue to perform well, even though in some sectors production is increasingly being moved abroad to countries where labour costs are lower.

Inflation will remain weak and well below the euro zone average over our forecast horizon. In 2020 we expect inflation to decline to 0.1% (from 0.6% in 2019) as weaker consumer confidence and a 37% collapse in global oil prices pull down prices. In 2021 price growth will firm to 0.9%, following a moderate recovery in domestic demand and improving conditions in the labour market. Over 2022-24 we expect inflation to stabilise at an average of about 1.4% per year-below the average in the rest of the euro area.

The oil price crash and the prospect of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) sent the euro soaring to US$1.15:EUR1 in early March, but this surge proved temporary as the global spread of the coronavirus boosted the US dollar's safe-haven status. In April-May the euro hovered between US$1.08:EUR1 and US$1.11:EUR1, but it has since strengthened, as an agreement between EU leaders on a significant economic recovery fund in late July and higher political risk in the US have supported the euro. We expect the euro to average US$1.11:EUR1 in 2020. A stronger rebound in the US economy relative to the euro zone will keep the euro broadly stable next year. Thereafter, we expect a gradual strengthening, supported by the bloc's large current-account surplus and a reduction in global risk.

The current account will remain in surplus throughout our forecast horizon, at close to 2.4% of GDP on average. Large trade surpluses and a small positive balance in the primary income account more than offset a trade deficit in services and a negative balance in the secondary income account. Overall, the persistent current-account surplus reflects a lack of domestic demand combined with a limited return for domestic investments, which is driving investors to recycle capital into overseas markets.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Italy Stocks and flows Net inward foreign direct investment (FDI) flows are low compared with most other EU countries, and Italy has generally been a net exporter of FDI. Net inflows to declined to close to zero in 2012, owing to large disinvestments. Net inflows recovered moderately in 2013-16, averaging US$18.9bn per year (0.8% of GDP). Inward FDI rose to US$39.6bn in 2018 (equivalent to 1.9% of GDP), up from US$11bn in 2017, before dropping back to US$29.2bn in 2019 (equivalent to 1.5% of GDP) amid political volatility. Italy attracts less greenfield foreign investment than other large European economies. The total stock of FDI was US$574bn in 2019, about 60% of total FDI in France, about a third of that in Germany and a quarter of that in the UK. In relation to GDP, the stock of FDI was 28.7% in 2019-lower than in every other EU country apart from Greece. FDI outflows have also generally been small, mainly reflecting the prevalence of small and medium-sized companies in Italy. In 2005-09 Italy recorded substantial outward FDI flows as a result of several major investments abroad in the banking and energy sectors. A similarly large outflow, of about US$52bn, was recorded in 2011-the year that Italian car manufacturer Fiat bought the US Treasury's remaining stake in Chrysler.
Origin and distribution FDI from Europe accounts for about 60-65% of company revenue and employment generated by foreign companies with operations in Italy. Companies from North America represent about 25-30% of revenue and employment, and those from Japan for about 3-4%. The manufacturing sector contributed about 40% of the total revenue and value-added of foreign­owned firms, but this has generally been on a downward path and dropped sharply in 2005, when General Motors (US) sold its stake in Fiat. The utilities and telecommunications sectors have registered the most rapid expansion. In 2018, the last year for which data are available (expressed according to the directional principle), the largest FDI stocks came from the Netherlands (US$63.4bn), Spain (US$40bn), Germany (US$35.7bn) and France (US$30.5bn).
Determinants The main attraction for foreign companies to set up operations in Italy is the size of the domestic market, which offers a population of about 6om and average GDP per head of US$44,004 at purchasing power parity (PPP). Deterrents include the complexity of Italy's legal system, inefficiencies in public administration, inadequate infrastructure-particularly in the south of the country-and often high regulatory barriers to entry, especially in services sectors. In addition, studies of the determinants of FDI in southern Italy have highlighted typical deterrents to investment, such as distance from major European markets, low presence of other foreign companies and a high level of organised crime. Such studies seem to indicate that fiscal incentives and the presence of specialised producer service providers have a low impact on foreign entrants' decisions, but that human capital is an important positive variable. Italy has an abundant workforce in the south, which has attracted a few high-technology investments to areas such as Catania in Sicily, where a Franco-Italian joint venture, ST Microelectronics, has a production plant and several research centres.
Impact According to the Italian Trade and Investment Agency (ITA), foreign-controlled companies employ more than 1m people in Italy and generate revenue of about EUR5oobn per year. Foreign companies invest on average three and half times more in research and development (R&D) than Italian companies. However, because of the comparatively low level of inflows and their concentration in the north of Italy, the impact of FDI on the Italian economy as a whole has been limited. The depressed areas of the south, which attract limited Italian private-sector investment, would benefit substantially in terms of employment and through the spillover effect of advanced technology, management practices and production processes. However, almost all of the inward FDI stock is located in the north and centre of the country. Despite massive state investment in 1950-84, the south has continued to lag central Italy and the north in GDP per head terms (less than 55% of the average in the centre and north). The unemployment rate in the south is almost double the national average and about three times higher than that in the north.
Potential The possibility of higher FDI inflows in the forecast period (2020-24) will be hampered by the uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the fact that most of the factors that have deterred FDI in the past will remain in place. The previous Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S)-Lega administration implemented a less friendly policy stance towards foreign investment, marginally tightening labour contract regulations through its so-called Dignity Decree in 2018, and enforcing penalties on foreign firms that take advantage of government investment incentives and then divest or relocate production to other markets. Over the forecast period a slight improvement is expected in the efficiency of the public administration, as a result of recent and ongoing reforms. The performance of the state body responsible for attracting foreign investors may also improve. Given Italy's need to reduce its dependence on imported energy, there could be potential for investment in the still state-dominated energy sector as liberalisation continues to make progress and the authorities are forced to focus on investment in renewable energy sources. Under the current M5S-Partito Democratico (PD) government, political opposition to foreign interest in ownership of utility networks and possibly some companies in the manufacturing sector is likely to continue, as such companies are deemed to be of a "strategic" nature. M5S, which has taken strong environmental stances in the past, may also use potential ecological consequences as a justification for limiting inward investment, particularly in infrastructure or energy projects. Banking sector reforms may increase opportunities for foreign investment in smaller Italian banks.

Population growth is projected to decline Having declined for several years in the late 1990s, Italy's total population increased moderately in 1999-2017, rising by an average of 0.4% per year. Since then the population has started to decline again, to 60.6m in 2019, according to the UN's population estimates. This was mainly driven by the natural decline of the Italian population, which has outpaced immigration. The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that the population will fall in the long term, as the expectation of scarce job opportunities owing to the weakness of the economy has reduced the influx of immigrants and driven further emigration of young Italians. The previous Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S)-Lega government's tough stance on immigration discouraged foreigners from settling in Italy. Since the EU's March 2016 agreement with Turkey, the flow of migrants from Turkey to Greece and on to northern Europe has more or less ceased. Migrant inflows fell sharply in 2018-19. This was partly due to stepped-up collaboration with the Libyan authorities, but also to the inflexible stance of the M5S-Lega administration and of the Maltese authorities, which appear to be deterring migrant vessels from seeking to cross the central Mediterranean. In the past most migrants arriving in Italy moved on to other EU countries, notably Germany.
According to Istat (the national statistics office), the proportion of foreign residents in the total population has increased steadily in recent years, from 4.5% in 2005 to 8.8% at end-2019. The majority of immigrants live in the north and the centre of Italy, where foreign residents accounted for more than 10% of the population at end-2019 The five largest national groups are Romanians, Albanians, Moroccans, Chinese and Ukrainians, which together account for about 50% of the total number of foreign residents.
Even during periods of modest economic growth, shortages of skilled and even unskilled workers are likely to re-emerge in areas of high employment such as the north east, owing to deficiencies in the labour market.
Reforms seek to increase labour mobility The steady rise in the employment rate (the percentage of people aged 20-64 in employment) since the mid-1990s came to a halt in 2008. According to Eurostat, the employment rate stood at 62.3% in 2016, just below the 62.9% employment rate in 2008, but 10 percentage points lower than the EU28 average and the third-lowest rate in the EU. The reasons for this include cultural factors, but also the low effective retirement age and limited mobility from areas of high unemployment in the south to those of high employment in the north. Low labour mobility has been perpetuated to a large extent by the greater use of temporary employment contracts, especially for young workers, poor active labour market policies and an inadequate system of unemployment benefits. The labour market reforms approved since 2012 will gradually address some of these issues during the forecast period (2020-24). In spite of the projected decline in the working-age population during the forecast period, the labour force will increase moderately. This will reflect greater female participation and pension reforms, which have reduced the incentive for early retirement.
The rise in the proportion of the elderly will put pressure on pensions During the forecast period the number of people reaching working age will be considerably lower than the number of people reaching 65. As a result, Italy's old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of people aged over 65 to those of working age) will rise further. At an estimated 37% in 2019, it is already the highest in the EU. This trend, combined with the continued rise in life expectancy, will continue to put upward pressure on public expenditure on pensions and care for the elderly. Italy's public pension spending has been on a steadily rising trend and is among the highest in the EU as a share of GDP. According to figures from the Ministry of the Economy, public pension spending is projected to decline gradually over the next ten years, from a peak of about 16% in 2013-14, owing to a series of reforms introduced since the beginning of the 1990s. However, costs could decline less markedly or even rise owing to the lingering effects of a partial rollback by the previous M5S-Lega government of the 2011 Fornero pension reform, the most recent effort to improve the social security system's sustainability.

Italy is one of the largest markets in Europe, with a population of just over 60m, and is one of its most affluent nations. However, growth potential remains limited because the country is a mature consumer market with weak income and population growth prospects.
Cost-consciousness will remain an important consumer trend Consumer sentiment and spending will be constrained this year by the practical disruptions caused by measures enacted to slow the spread of the coronavirus, as well as by a sharp rise in unemployment. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects retail sales to contract in 2020, before recovering from 2021. The closure of all non-essential commercial activities in March-May had an immediate and direct impact on consumption in the country, with the travel, entertainment, hospitality and dining industries the most affected. But even if the Italian economy recovers substantially in the second half of 2020, consumer activity is likely to remain compressed. We expect many customers to remain cautious, given the uncertain outlook, and cost-consciousness will remain an important trend. Fear of contagion will continue to deter people from attending public spaces. Consumption of durable goods, which can be delayed, is likely to recover rapidly once the crisis is over. Italian households should emerge with relatively decent savings from this crisis, as the government has passed an emergency fiscal package that includes wage subsidies, aimed at preventing lay-offs, and a significant boost to unemployment insurance. However, industries that produce non-durable goods and services will suffer a permanent loss of revenue. This type of consumption tends to be non-deferrable, and even if households wished to spend more after the crisis, capacity constraints and social distancing rules will prevent businesses from recouping the revenue lost during the lockdown.
In terms of private consumption per head, Italy is just below the euro area average, but well below Finland, Sweden, France and Germany. However, the relative weakness of Italian economic growth for much of the past 15-20 years means that GDP per head-at purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion rates that explicitly adjust for differences in price levels between countries-has fallen steadily as a percentage of the EU28 average, remaining below 100% since 2013. GDP per head at PPP rates stood at an estimated US$44,004 in 2019. Income levels differ greatly on a regional basis, with GDP per head in the south about 46% of that in the north. Development policies in the past 50 years have done little to close the gap.

Despite relatively high income levels, spending on food, beverages and tobacco is still high as a share of total consumer spending, at about 18%-just above the level in France, but significantly above that in the Netherlands (about 15%), Germany (13.9%) and the UK (12%). We expect it to decline only gradually during the forecast period (2020-24), largely because of subdued spending on other categories of goods and services.
Consumer credit demand has begun to rise after several years of stagnation and/or contraction. Household indebtedness is relatively low, and interest rates on consumer loans have declined and are expected to remain subdued in 2020-24, containing the proportion of disposable income spent on debt servicing. Still, we expect only moderately stronger demand for big-ticket items and branded goods, as consumers are likely to postpone purchases until sentiment improves further and risks to the recovery diminish. Rates of ownership of traditional consumer durable goods, such as white goods and passenger cars, are generally high, so demand will be driven by technological change and the need to replace ageing stock. Demand for electronic goods, such as computers (especially laptops and tablets) and smartphones, has shown a tendency to outperform the rest of the consumer goods market.
The ageing population will drive growth in healthcare spending Demographic trends will have an important impact on spending patterns. The ageing population will continue to drive overall healthcare spending, but we expect efforts to curb public healthcare expenditure to be introduced in order to meet budgetary targets.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Initial conditions: Italy's economic growth performance has been poor in the past two decades, even in comparison with the sluggish average rate of growth achieved by core countries within the EU. As well as undergoing severe fiscal consolidation during the 1990s in order to join the euro area, which dampened growth in that decade, the Italian economy has suffered from a steady loss of competitiveness owing to low productivity growth and rising unit labour costs (reflecting falling output, despite wage moderation since 1993)-in contrast to the situation in its main trading partners.
The weakness of Italy's political and institutional framework policy hinders policy formulation, as reforms are frequently delayed or watered down under pressure from a wide range of interest groups. The current administration is unlikely to enact policy changes that will improve the country's com-petitiveness. Italy's public finances also remain weak, limiting the scope to reduce taxation or stimulate demand during cyclical downturns. Public-sector spending is constrained, as the public debt is on course to reach over 163% of GDP in 2020 in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. This will hold back capital spending in the medium to long term. Major brakes on Italy's long-term growth will be the country's unfavourable demographic profile, low labour participation rates, a collapse in fixed investment in 2020, and low levels of investment in research and development (R&D).
Unfavourable demographic trends will weigh on long-term growth Demographic trends: Italy's demographic profile is particularly unfavourable. Projected net immigration will be insufficient to halt the continued decline in the working-age population in the long-term forecast period (2020-50). Italy's labour market participation rate is expected to rise from the current low levels of about 66%, but only moderately, reflecting an increase in the number of women joining the workforce and a gradual rise in the minimum retirement age. However, it will remain well below the OECD average (about 72% in 2018) and will be insufficient to prevent an annual average decline in the labour force of 0.8% in 2020-50.
External conditions: Italian companies have generally been slow to adapt to the rigours of fixed exchange rates in the euro area and the increase in competition from goods produced in low-cost developing countries, although some traditional manufacturing sectors have undergone restructuring in recent years, notably textiles and clothing, and automotive. This difficulty seems unlikely to change in the medium to long term. Small and medium-sized export-oriented manufacturing companies have struggled to compete in some low- to medium-technology sectors. This is attributed to the lack of investment in R&D, and innovation and marketing, as well as to difficulties in protecting and promoting the generic ''Made in Italy" brand, which has long been considered synonymous with good quality and style. To survive, Italian companies will have to expand in size and increasingly outsource low-value-added production to locations in central and eastern Europe and Asia, where costs-especially labour costs-are lower.
With institutional change off the agenda, economic reform will be slow Institutions and policy trends: Italy's poor growth performance has raised concerns among policymakers about the country's future economic prospects. Policy responses triggered by such debates in the past have generally been short lived. Some reforms have been introduced since the financial turmoil of late 2011. However, popular and political resistance to reform halted the Renzi government's attempt to overhaul Italy's institutional framework in 2014-16, taking institutional change off the political agenda for the foreseeable future. Without a substantial improvement in its political and institutional framework, Italy's efforts to carry out reforms will continue to lag the rapid pace of change in the world economy and the increase in competition.
In particular, Italy will need further liberalisation of its product and services markets, although recent reforms, if they are not reversed, should help to reduce labour market rigidities over the medium to long term. A more comprehensive system of unemployment protection envisaged under the 2012 and 2014 reforms could help to enhance labour mobility, but there may be a lack of resources. Without more drastic cuts in public spending on pensions, this will now rise again until late 2040. The previous Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S)-Lega government partially rolled back the most recent reform, passed in 2011, which will lead to a deterioration in the pension spending profile. To raise long-term productivity growth, the country will also have to improve the quality of human capital. Recent education reforms have sought to address shortcomings in the education system, including high drop-out rates and mismatches between the skills needed by employers and qualifications held by potential employees.
A more favourable policy environment would boost long-term growth Long-term performance: The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast is that Italian GDP growth will average 0.3% per year in 2020-50. The main brake on long-term growth will be an unfavourable demographic profile, which will be offset only partly by expected moderate improvements in labour productivity and technological infrastructure. Other industrialised countries will continue to grow faster than Italy, and so it will fall further behind in terms of GDP per head, which in the decade to 2019 fell from 107% of the EU28 average to 96%. In addition, decades of massive public-sector spending have done little to narrow the large income gap between the more developed centre and north of Italy, and the south of the country. This imbalance is expected to continue to weigh on Italy's overall growth performance in the long term. A more favourable political environment could produce a better economic growth performance in the long term, but the chance of improvements in Italy's institutional framework being implemented in the short to medium term is limited.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Climate change is expected to have a moderate, but clearly negative effect on Italian living standards and the economy. Hotter summers increase the risk of drought, particularly in the country's southern and island regions, in many parts of which water is scarce. This will have an impact on food crops and agricultural production, and could affect human health, especially among the country's growing elderly population, as well. In 2017 six of 20 Italian regions called on the government to declare a state of emergency owing to water stress. In addition to putting traditional agricultural products such as citrus fruits and wine grapes at risk, an increased incidence of drought will also heighten the risk of wildfires. Italy has about 7,600 km of coastline, and rising sea levels could put some low-lying coastal areas of the country at risk of flooding. Rising seas will be particularly problematic for the city of Venice, a major tourist destination and a regional capital, and more erratic weather patterns are likely to strain ageing infrastructure. The Economist Intelligence Unit's model to evaluate the impact of climate change on long-term growth finds that the Italian economy will be 2.8% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth.
Technological developments Despite Italy's sizeable manufacturing base and the presence of some notable high-technology firms, technological uptake has been limited, constrained in part by small average firm size and family management, which in some cases limits innovation. In 2017-18 a representative survey of nearly 24,000 industrial firms conducted by the Ministry of Economic Development found that only 8.4% had implemented technologies associated with "Industry 4.0" or the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing, such as 3D printing, the Internet of Things, Cloud technologies, or Big Data analytics. The share rises sharply in firms with 250 or more employees, to about 47%, from 6% for firms with fewer than ten employees. In 2017 research and development (R&D) spending accounted for just 1.35% of GDP-well below the EU average of 2%. Meanwhile the trade balance of high-technology goods stood at -0.54% of GDP in 2015 (latest data available). Since 2016, a series of tax credits and deductions known as Impresa 4.0 has been introduced to encourage investment in R&D and productivity-enhancing technologies, but a higher level of direct support and possibly an upskilling of the labour force may be necessary to take full advantage of technological advances. Persons with a tertiary degree or employed in science and technology account for about 33% of total employment, and higher education suffers from relatively high dropout rates and long university completion times.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2015-19) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2020-24). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2015-19. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2020-24 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2015-19 ranges are then used to derive 2020-24 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2020-24, not to the likely situation in 2024 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2017 or 2022). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - The military-aligned Phalang Pracharat (PP) will continue to lead the government under prime minister and former coup leader, Prayuth Chan-ocha. The military's overarching influence will be ensured by the constitution drafted by the junta in 2016-17. As a result, Prayuth will most likely see out his four-year term, due to end in 2023, bar a dramatic escalation of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and related economic crisis. The PP is well placed to secure a similar arrangement after the next election. However, a significant and increasingly vocal anti-military opposition inside and outside of parliament will capitalise on any missteps of Prayuth's government. This means that serious challenges to the government, particularly later in the forecast period, cannot be ruled out.

- Thailand's business environment score remains unchanged in 2020-24. Progress elsewhere means that its global ranking has fallen by one place to 38th from 37th in 2015-19. Its regional position remains at ninth out of 17 countries. However, the steady score disguises some big changes in a number of sub-categories. The macroeconomic environment will significantly worsen amid the coronavirus pandemic and the expected gradual pace of recovery, particularly in the early part of the forecast period. Likewise, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a deterioration in the foreign trade & exchange controls category as the external sector suffers severe headwinds amid the global pandemic for an extended period of time. A marked improvement in Thailand's political environment, resulting from the continued stability of Prayuth's government, helps compensate for the tumbling scores in the aforementioned categories. Construction will accelerate as the government bet on big-ticket projects for job creation and economic stimulus amid the pandemic.

- We expect Thailand's real GDP to expand by a meagre 1.8% a year on average in 2020-24. The relatively lacklustre performance reflects the heavy toll exacted by the pandemic-induced recession in 2020. It will take until at least mid-2022 for the economy to recover to its pre-pandemic level of output. Growth will rely more heavily on public investment in infrastructure development as household spending falls. It will only be later in the forecast period that a pick-up in global demand will enable faster expansion.

- The rate of population growth will slow in the forecast period as a result of effective family-planning programmes and changing social norms, such as later marriage and smaller families. Improvement in the prevention and treatment of infectious disease will contribute to a rising life expectancy and also an ageing population. This will put a burden on healthcare provision. Migrant labour from Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos will grow in absolute terms after seeing a temporary slump in 2020-21 amid pandemic-related travel restrictions. This will continue to boost the labour force in 2020-24, against the trend of a declining domestic workforce.

- Thailand is a sizeable market, with a population of 69.6m and nominal GDP equivalent to US$530.5bn (at market exchange rates) in 2020. As with the broader economy, the retail sector will experience a dismal 2020 amid falling income owing to the pandemic. In the latter part of the forecast period, the sector will create more market opportunities, following a rebound in domestic spending and rising tourist arrivals. Household debt will remain a dampener on consumer sentiment in the forecast period. The rapid rise of e-commerce and digital payments will irrevocably change consumers' habits and create new winners at the expense of traditional bricks-and-mortar stores.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.

- Thailand's long-term outlook hinges on the assumption that governments in the next ten years will prove capable of enacting structural reforms and develop infrastructure. There will be persistent challenges owing to an inefficient bureaucracy, political deadlock and strong regional competition. Without such reforms, Thailand's growth will consistently fall well below its potential. In later decades, its unfavourable demographic profile and the impact of climate change will also exert a negative impact on GDP growth and political stability.

Background: Following a revolution in 1932, Thailand's absolute monarchy was replaced with a constitutional monarchy. Although the elected government gained prominence, democracy was turbulent and has subsequently been subject to 19 coups. The latest took place in 2014, when the democratically elected government, led by Yingluck Shinawatra, was removed following months of political turmoil. Yingluck's older brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, had also been elected prime minister, before his removal in a coup in 2006. Thaksin was a populist leader, and his political standing created a divide between the rural population in the northern provinces and the urban rich of the south-a lasting feature of Thai democracy. A return to a limited form of democracy from 2019, led by military-aligned parties, is likely to renew rivalry between the two camps.
Political structure: Following the recent transition from junta administration to nominally civilian government, parliament takes the form of a 750-seat National Assembly, consisting of an elected 500-seat House of Representatives (the lower house) and a 250-seat Senate (the upper house) appointed by the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO). The prime minister is appointed by the National Assembly, and the king, Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, remains the symbolic head of state.
Policy issues: The military-aligned government will prioritise protecting people's livelihoods and adopt measures aimed at reviving the economy in the short term. Post-pandemic, it will return to its focus on improving the investment environment in Thailand, which will include an expedition of the upgrade of infrastructure, in an effort to facilitate the country's economic breakthrough in the long term. This emphasis on long-term policy continuity should reassure many foreign investors deterred by potential political instability, but growing regional competition will detract from Thailand's attractiveness as an investment destination.
Taxation: Corporate income tax stands at 20%. Tax concessions are available for firms that list on the stock market. Value-added tax stands at 7%. Personal income tax rises to 35% on annual taxable earnings exceeding Bt5m (US$150,000). Amid the pandemic, however, the government has waived and deferred payments of taxes for the 2020 fiscal year.
Foreign trade: Thailand recorded a merchandise trade surplus (fob-fob) of US$26.7bn in 2019, up from US$22.4bn in 2018. As a result, the current-account surplus stood at US$38.3bn in 2019, up from its 2018 level of US$28.5bn

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance A military-aligned government assumed power in July 2019 following the national legislative election held in March. The government consists of an 18-party coalition led by the Phalang Pracharat (PP) party, with a former general and coup leader, Prayuth Chan-ocha, as prime minister. Following the turbulent events surrounding the dissolution of the second-largest opposition party, Future Forward (FFP) in February 2020 and subsequent defections, the coalition has cemented its hold on power. Prior to the 2019 election, the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO, the military junta) had ruled Thailand since the coup of 2014 and the military continues to exercise influence on public affairs through a constitution drafted by its members in 2016-17. The legislature comprises a 250-seat Senate (upper house) appointed by the NCPO and endorsed by the king, and a 500-seat House of Representatives (lower house), elected democratically. These features will incline future regimes to be aligned with the junta's preferences. Nonetheless, the military's grip is weakened by the fact that the Phalang Pracharat governs in a coalition, which still only controls a small majority and is engulfed in internal bickering. The lower house also includes a large and vocal anti-junta opposition (led by Puea Thai, the party of two former prime ministers-and siblings-Yingluck and Thaksin Shinawatra, and the Move Forward Party-a continuation of the now-banned FFP).
King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, who was formally crowned in May 2019, will oversee stability in the monarchy. Although the king will remain removed from day-to-day politics, he will adopt a more centralised style of leadership than that of his revered late father. Later in the forecast period, the military will look to the monarchy to legitimise its own political role in an indication of the continued strength of the royalist-military alliance, which has dominated the country's politics since the coup in 2014. Nonetheless, the king's prominent place in Thai society will diminish in coming years, as the new monarch, stung further by online criticism about his performance during the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, fails to command the same level of reverence among the public that his father did.

Political outlook: Political stability The government proclaimed a state of emergency in March 2020, granting it sweeping powers to restrict fundamental freedoms and movement in response to the coronavirus crisis. The prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, invoked the emergency power to impose a lockdown. Economic activity has largely resumed since May. However, despite a significant reduction in new infections, the government has extended the emergency decree on multiple occasions, with the latest expected to last until end-August. A strong domestic and international backlash would ensue if Prayuth were seen to be seeking an indefinite extension.
Although junta rule formally came to an end in July 2019, The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that the military will retain significant political influence in the forecast period (2020-24). A national legislative election held in early 2019 resulted in a government led by the military-aligned PP party, under Prayuth, a former coup leader. The military establishment's control over government will be further assured by an entirely junta-appointed Senate (the upper house of parliament). As a result, we expect Prayuth to serve out his four-year term until 2023.
We believe that political stability will be maintained during the forecast period, largely because of the continued participation of opposition parties in the political process. Voter turnout for the last election was high, at nearly 75%, and the opposition gained a sizeable share of seats in the House of Representatives (lower house). These factors will influence anti-coup forces to respect the results of the election in the medium term.
Nonetheless, there is a risk that parties will eventually boycott formal politics and lead demonstrations in the run-up to the next national election in 2023, in protest at the military's disproportionate influence over the government. Under this scenario, violence could ensue and the military could again assume total control of the government. This risk has increased in line with anger over the continued crackdown on the opposition amid a pandemic-induced recession. In February 2020 the Constitutional Court disbanded the second-largest opposition party, the FFP, prompting a series of rallies against what the party's supporters decry as politically motivated prosecution. Mostly student-led protests have resumed following the lifting of lockdown since June, although they have, to date, struggled to attract a turnout either large or resilient enough to oust Prayuth's government. However, the scale of such demon-strations could grow significantly towards the end of the government's term if Prayuth is seen to have failed to address the steep pandemic-induced recession.
The rule of King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, who was crowned formally in May 2019 after two years on the throne, will have a minimal impact on political stability. The military establishment depends on royal endorsement for much of its political legitimacy and will, therefore, continue to suppress criticism of the new monarch, including recent online discussion of the king's response to the pandemic, via lèse-majesté laws.
King Maha has sought to consolidate his position in the political sphere by weakening rules concerning the delegation of the monarch's authority, as well as control over court affairs and palace staff. However, royal intrusion into everyday politics will remain rare. Many of the king's changes are intended to ensure that he can continue to reside outside the country for long periods, without having to delegate his powers.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness The outlook for political and institutional effectiveness will be underpinned by policy continuity under the military-aligned government, as well as broad respect for the junta-drafted constitution of 2016-17. In particular, the Phalang Pracharat's ability to pass and implement legislation will be supported by the constitutionally mandated 20-year "National Strategy"-a blueprint for develop-ment devised by the junta. Although the party will govern in alliance with 17 other parties, support on most issues (and especially those related to infra-structure and investment) will be guaranteed by the fact that the majority of party leaders are loyalists keen to remain in power. Nonetheless, frequent disputes and factional struggles within the coalition on issues outside the National Strategy could continue to stall major policies, as evidenced by the delayed passage of the 2020 budget. The national sense of urgency and the ongoing state of emergency, which grants immense power to the prime minister, will temporarily expedite the policymaking process in 2020.
Significant threats to government effectiveness will also arise from the vocal opposition, which has vehemently criticised the military's continued grip on power. The end of the emergency decree at the end of 2020 will lead to a return to even more intense political confrontation as pent-up grievances among the opposition re-emerge. Such grievances will focus largely on the government's handling of the pandemic and issues around an economy mired in a deep recession. This will lead to instances of legislative gridlock and stymied policymaking. Later in the forecast period, a potential boycott of parliament, coinciding with growing street protests, could impede the government's ability to enact new legislation.
Nonetheless, the Phalang Pracharat, especially during the pandemic, will devote significant resources to populist policies, to appease interest groups such as farmers and tourist operators, while simultaneously pursuing a pro-business push. The junta has not made significant progress in reconciling the longstanding political differences between the rural population of the north (who supported Thaksin) and the elite in southern Thailand (who are represented by his detractors, the current establishment) as well as the newly emerging voices from metropolitan youths for constitutional reform. The military-aligned government will consequently continue to find it difficult to satisfy the two major camps and may face rising opposition from one or both of the rural and student population in the medium term.
Corruption will remain a significant problem in many of the country's institutions, including the military. Cases under the government involving unelected officials, particularly those with explicit military links, may serve as a flashpoint for discontent over the constitutional system and its lack of accountability. If open discontent does materialise, it is more likely to be the cumulative point of a series of incidents and, therefore, to occur later in the forecast period. Although the administration will make efforts to show a tougher stance against corruption, for instance by encouraging use of a dedicated court, these measures will be pursued selectively in accordance with political influence. Given the slow progress of similar initiatives under previous military-aligned governments, there is little reason to believe that the admini-stration will be any more successful in clamping down on corrupt activities.
Political outlook: Election watch A national election for the 500-seat House of Representatives was held in March 2019. The military-aligned PP secured 116 seats, compared with 136 seats for the Puea Thai party of a former prime minister (2001-06), Thaksin Shinawatra, and 81 seats won by Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit's FFP. PP forged an alliance with 18 parties to secure 254 seats and a majority in the chamber. This allowed the appointment of Prayuth as prime minister. Since then, the government's position has solidified; it now commands support from more than 270 members of parliament (MPs), partly owing to the defection of 15 former FFP members and the disqualification of another 11. The departure of several senior members from the governing PP in July 2020, after their faction lost the party chair to a confidant of Prayuth in a recent election, will not threaten the prime minister's enhanced parliamentary majority. Despite the deep recession that we expect Thailand to suffer in 2020, we believe that PP and other military-aligned parties are likely to secure a slim legislative majority at the election in 2023. Their success will be bolstered by post-pandemic recovery and continued marginalisation of opposition parties by legal means.
Political outlook: International relations We expect a deepening of Thailand's ties with Western governments in 2020-24, following the normalisation of relations after the election. This will include the resumption of talks on an EU-Thailand free-trade agreement (FTA), as well as more frequent high-profile visits by Western leaders. Meanwhile, Japan will build on its connections with Thailand to pursue bilateral FTA nego-tiations; this reflects the Japanese government's concern that its economic influence in Thailand may be overtaken as Chinese investment in the country rises. This should lead to a strengthening of the economic partnership between Thailand and Japan. Nevertheless, China's influence in Thailand will continue to grow in the after-math of the pandemic-induced recession. With no conflicting territorial claims in the South China Sea, economic ties are set to strengthen further as Thailand focuses on attracting Chinese investment under two flagship initiatives: Thailand 4.0 and the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), a large special economic zone (SEZ) south-east of the capital, Bangkok.
However, contractual and geopolitical tussles will continue to delay the economic benefits of greater regional integration. Increasing bilateral co-operation with China is unlikely to obstruct Thailand's ongoing efforts to engage with fellow member states of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). This will allow Thailand to strengthen relations and to boost cross-border trade with its ASEAN neighbours, such as Cambodia and Myanmar. It will also continue to play an active role within ASEAN in promoting further regional integration, starting with a push for the signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade agreement.

The macroeconomic environment will worsen in the forecast period, as the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic deals a heavy blow to the export-oriented manufacturing and tourism sectors, which will recover only gradually from 2021. An improvement in the scores for infrastructure and policy towards foreign investment will encourage a moderate rise in investment in the medium term. Some relocation of supply chains to Thailand, amid persistent China-US tensions, will also provide a modest boost to manufacturing activity in the latter part of the forecast period. This will be aided by an open capital account and a relatively stable currency. The "Thailand 4.0" initiative entails an ambitious infrastructure upgrade, which will accelerate during the forecast period as the government bets on construction projects to stimulate economic growth. However, lacklustre domestic demand will remain a major drag on business sentiment, with high household debt weighing on private consumption prospects, especially in the aftermath of the pandemic.
BOT will support government efforts at post-pandemic recovery The Bank of Thailand (BOT, the central bank) will remain independent, although the incoming governor, Sethaput Suthiwart-Narueput, who is set to take office in October 2020, will continue to work with the government to help revive the economy after a deep recession. This will entail the maintenance of a loose monetary policy and, potentially, the deployment of some unconventional policy tools, which will mark a departure from the BOT's long-standing conservative approach.

This has prompted a fall in the country's global rankings: the imminent deep recession will erode the traditionally strong fundamentals underpinning Thailand's macroeconomic stability. GDP growth will decelerate considerably compared to the pace achieved in recent years, averaging only 1.8% in 2020-24, compared with 3.4% in 2015-19. The economy will shrink by 5.3% in 2020, owing to a contraction of private consumption growth and a drastic slump in receipts from exports amid the global pandemic. External and domestic demand will pick up only in the later part of the forecast period, and growing competition with peers in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) will keep a lid on growth.
The economy will take at least two years to return to its pre-pandemic level The military will maintain a strong grip on economic affairs in 2020-24, and oversee the approval of major spending plans to stimulate the economy back to growth. The constitutionally mandated "National Strategy", the junta's 20--year blueprint for development, will undergo changes after an ongoing review by the government's National Economic and Social Development Council, with a stronger emphasis on generating tangible results in terms of job creation and GDP growth in the short term. This will include an expedition of infrastructure projects and renewed commitments on sectors such as tourism and agriculture, where Thailand has traditionally been competitive. At the same time, the government will also ensure that business-oriented tax reform and investment incentives are maintained and expanded in 2020-24, and that major infrastructure investment projects continue beyond this period. In the early part of the forecast period, the export-dependent economy will be hit hard by external headwinds amid the pandemic. Nonetheless, broad economic stability will be ensured by sound macroeconomic fundamentals, including a still-healthy current-account surplus and manageable levels of public debt. This will be helped by a recovery in growth in 2022-24, as global economic conditions normalise.
The central bank will welcome Setthaput Suthiwart-Narueput as the new governor, after the incumbent, Veerathai Santiprabhob, who took the reins in October 2015, declined to seek a second term. However, this will not undermine the BOT's credibility as it remains relatively free from political pressure in setting policy rates and managing excess volatility of the local currency, the baht. It will nevertheless continue to take aggressive measures, including maintaining a loose monetary policy, to revitalise the economy, which aligns neatly with Prayuth's economic agenda.
Business environment outlook: Policy towards private enterprise and competition

We expect a modest drop in the score for policy towards private enterprise and competition as the government prioritises saving state-owned and large corporations with connections to powerful officials. Thailand's global ranking falls from 31st in 2015-19 to 38th in 2020-24. However, the country's regional ranking will remain unchanged owing to concurrent declines in other Asian countries. Corruption and favouritism will continue to distort free-market dynamics, as evidenced by the slow progress of cases, despite the media attention the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) has received in recent years. The political elite retain a disproportionate influence on commercial affairs: individuals with ties to military and royalist leaders tend to extract concessions from government and influence legal judgments. Against this backdrop, the return to a quasi-civilian regime since the March 2019 election will not lead to any significant improvement in government accountability.
The pace of privatisation of SOEs will slow further in 2020-24
- Reforms to bolster the operational efficiency of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have been proposed in recent years, but the prospect of their implementation has grown even more remote in the wake of the coronvirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Any such reform would redistribute economic rents away from current holders. Privatisation remains a sensitive issue among both powerful interests and the public. It is unlikely that the military-aligned government will sell off state assets, especially after those assets have received government bail-outs and will likely remain at discounted prices for the foreseeable future. A long-standing area of concern is the lack of protection for intellectual property (IP): legal provisions are in place to control piracy of digital and online content, but enforcement is poor, even by regional standards. As a result, the country remains on the EU's priority watchlist. The continuation of price controls will distort competition in Thailand, as the government will keep price controls for some basic goods to make them affordable; prices for goods on the "sensitive" list cannot be changed without the permission of the Ministry of Commerce.

IP infringement will remain an issue in the medium term
- The reform of corporate governance at 56 SOEs, controlling assets worth over US$300bn, will stall. Since the 2019 election, Prayuth's government has made no tangible attempt to kick-start such reform. As the political agenda will centre on post-pandemic recovery, complex and divisive longer-term initiatives that do not result in immediate gains will be put on the backburner. "Superboards", devised under the junta regime to address public-sector corruption and oversee reform, will remain prone to political influence. SOEs will continue to be favoured in the state's often opaque procurement processes, as government is set to step up its investments to support the economy. In the unlikely event that the current opposition wrests power from the government amid the pandemic, such reforms will not occur, as the latter will want to avoid upsetting the establishment.
- Thailand has been on the US Trade Representative's lower-priority Watch List for IP since late 2017. While the country continues to make minor progress on matters related to patents and copyright legislation in recent years, instances of IP infringement remain relatively frequent. This is owing to a combination of legislative and enforcement issues, such as the country's absence from the World Intellectual Property Organisation's (WIPO) Copyright Treaty, a limited level of punitive measures and patent application backlogs. As the country seeks to reinvent itself as a "digital economy" under its "Thailand 4.0" initiative, we expect improvements in the legal apparatus that will offer greater protection for patent holders during the latter part of the forecast period. As with many emerging economies, however, enforcement will remain flawed.

The score for policy towards foreign investment will improve in 2020-24, compared with the historical period, raising both the country's regional and global rankings. Thailand will continue to encourage inward investment, especially in higher-value-added industries, as part of the "Thailand 4.0" industrial policy. Further incentives are almost certain to be rolled out in the aftermath of the pandemic, and the Board of Investment will continue to fast-track investment approvals. The government will also decline to revive proposals to amend the Foreign Business Act, which would make it more difficult for foreign companies to control Thai entities unless they own a majority of shares.

- The BOI's investment promotion strategy for 2015-22 offers incentives and government support for foreign investors. The strategy's central tenet provides for offers of generous tax breaks, land rights and so-called smart visas for companies and entrepreneurs involved in high-technology industries that will contribute to enhancing Thailand's productivity through technical training or promotion of automation technology. Amid the pandemic, the country will expand the list of sectors eligible for such incentives, such as manufacturers of medical equipment and drugs. It also focuses on the development of special economic zones (SEZs) along the land borders of Thailand and its neighbours as part of the "Eastern Economic Corridor". This is in place to take advantage of Thailand's increasing flows of international labour and goods via the country's seaports and aviation networks under the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), which was formally established in 2015. These objectives dovetail with the longer-term Thailand 4.0 policy.

The score for foreign trade and exchange controls falls in 2020-24, driven primarily by ongoing and expected travel restrictions owing to the spread of the coronavirus. This causes Thailand's global ranking to drop to 36th from 28th in 2015-19. The imposition of travel barriers will impede exchange of goods, especially cross-border trade during the early part of the forecast period. Thailand's reliance on international trade, as well as a collapse of external demand in 2020, will ensure that the government strives to maintain a favourable relationship with major export markets in 2020-22, beyond the necessary quarantine measures. Authorities will be more likely to accommodate the demands of influential domestic groups in 2023, with an approaching election and the expectation of a full recovery in its major export markets. The government will be keen to diversify export markets and continue to pursue trade agreements, both individually and in partnership with other ASEAN members. The bloc's agreements include those in place with China and India, and a combined agreement with Australia and New Zealand. Thailand will also be keen to complete negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), but its delayed progress following India's withdrawal will compel the country to pursue alternatives.

- In the meantime, the country will adhere to its commitments as a member of the WTO. Thailand has accepted the obligations laid down in the IMF's Article VIII, which stipulates that transactions on the current account should be free of restrictions. Foreign investors do not face restrictions on the repatriation of profits and dividends. The central bank has eased restrictions on outward capital flows, and temporary measures to control capital inflows imposed in 2019 and early 2020 will be lifted in the aftermath of the pandemic as the country urgently seeks a return of foreign investors.
- Thailand's continual liberalisation of its trade regime, in line with its commitment to implementing the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), will slow in 2020-24. While the AEC had already led to the lifting of most tariffs and freer movement of services, investment and skilled labour (in eight selected sectors) since end-2015, a commensurate increase of onerous customs regulations and non-tariff barriers (NTBs) from 2015 to 2019 continued to limit intra-regional trade. With the pandemic wreaking havoc on the fiscal and current accounts of ASEAN members, the use of such NTBs will rise further amid a shift to protecting domestic external sectors. This will have a particularly obvious impact on services trade, which has long been more vulnerable to such measures than are flows of goods. Expectations that the ASEAN Trade in Services Agreement (ATISA), in effect since October 2019, will lead to phenomenal growth of services trade in 2020-24 will not materialise during the forecast period. For instance, some of the subsectors that ATISA seeks to liberalise (such as healthcare) coincide with the strategic industries high on governments' protection lists.

Negotiation on joining the CPTPP will begin
- Formal talks on a bilateral free-trade agreement (FTA) between Thailand and the EU were put on hold after the 2014 coup, and were about to resume in early 2020 before the pandemic hit. European and Thai businesses are both keen to conclude a deal. Barring a deterioration in Thailand's politics, a Thai-EU deal is likely to be concluded before the end of the forecast period. At the same time, Thailand will start negotiation to join the 11-strong Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which counts Australia, Canada and Japan among its members.

Thailand's score in the taxes category declines only marginally in 2020-24. This is enough to prompt a drop in the country's global and regional rankings from 2015-19, from 11th to 17th and 5th to 7th, respectively. The minor drop in the score is owing to the unexpected year-long delay in the implementation of the new, fairer property and land tax. Nonetheless, Thailand's tax regime remains relatively simple and changes have been made in recent years to reduce the overall burden on households and firms. The standard rate of corporate tax was reduced from 30% in 2011 to 20% in 2013. We expect it to remain at 20%, given the government's priority of attracting foreign investors. The personal income is also relatively favourable, with the top marginal rate standing at 35% for Thai and foreign workers with annual earnings over Bt5m (US$145,000). Wide-ranging waivers for VAT, corporate and income taxes are in effect until at least September 2020 amid the pandemic.
Taxes will remain relatively low across the board
- Successive governments repeatedly postponed returning the VAT rate from a reduced rate of 7% to 10%, as per the official law. Amid the pandemic, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects this lower rate to be extended again into 2021. The authorities will raise the rate in 2023-24 as the need to plug the fiscal gap arising from a jump in expenditure in 2020-21 takes precedence. However, this decision will also be influenced by the prevailing political climate, as an increase in the VAT rate could serve as a catalyst for further protests. This means that the government will be unlikely to sanction a rise in 2022 owing to the proximity of the next election, which is due in early 2023.
- Coronavirus-related tax waivers will be in effect in the earlier part of the forecast period, as the military-aligned government will keep them in place to cushion the impact of the pandemic. This will include deferring the filing and payment of income and corporate tax for a year. For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as individuals, the government will increase the allowance of tax deduction in 2020. The withholding tax rate will also fall to 1.5-2% on income received from April to December 2020.
- The government will be prepared to run a significantly larger fiscal deficit in 2020-21 in order to finance the aforementioned measures. From 2022 onwards, the government will opt to cut spending, rather than raise taxes, to reduce the fiscal deficit. As a longer-term initiative, the government will make efforts to expand revenue collection. These will include measures to enable digital and mobile payments in order to broaden the tax base, as well as the imposition of capital gains tax later in the forecast period. Meanwhile, the aforementioned delayed tax on property and land will be implemented only in 2021. It will have only a minor impact on foreign business, with the tax rates most applicable to foreign investors likely to be set at less than 2%.

Thailand's score for financing will worsen in 2020-24, as the banking sector will face the headwinds of the pandemic-induced recession. As a result, Thailand's global ranking for the category slumps from 23rd in 2015-19 to 35th. Similarly, its regional ranking will slip to 9th, from 8th. The ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) to total loans remains relatively low, but, alarmingly, it had already surged to a nine-year high of 3.7% as at May 2020. This is likely to rise further for much of the remainder of 2020 as the devastating impact of the pandemic and lockdown continue to show. This will erode the overall health of the banking sector, although the central bank's support will contain any systemic shock.
The trend of consolidation in the financial sector will accelerate
- The BOT and the finance ministry will continue to focus on shoring up the resilience and competitiveness of the financial sector, principally via the consolidation of a number of private- and state-owned financial institutions. This will take on greater urgency as an expected surge in NPLs will likely weaken some commercial lenders, especially those with a portfolio of mostly SMEs and individuals. The facility set up by the central bank to purchase bad debts from troubled financial institutions will help clear the way for mergers and acquisitions. The ongoing negotiations on liberalising banking services under the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework will drag on amid the pandemic and only conclude towards the end of the forecast period. However, Thailand's other pursuit of increasing interoperability across ASEAN markets-via facilitating local currency settlement and standardised digitisation of payments-will make faster progress and be implemented by 2021.
- The local bond market will continue to expand under the guidance of the BOT. Although the pandemic has tampered investors' responses to Thai corporate bonds, this will be short-lived. Post-pandemic, the market will stay on its rapid-growth trajectory. Thailand's strong macroeconomic fundamentals and credible central bank, with a reputation for prudence, has made it ASEAN's largest local-currency bond market. Although government bonds continue to dominate the market, at over 70% of all bonds issued, debt-laden large and medium-sized companies are increasingly using the bond market to refinance their bank loans and offshore borrowings. Strengthening demand in this market will continue during the forecast period as capital flows into relatively safe assets and markets.

The deterioration in Thailand's global and regional rankings in the labour market category reflects its waning competitiveness. The country is a labour-scarce economy and the official unemployment rate remains consistently low, which continues to hold true even amid the pandemic. Labour market conditions will, in general, remain adequate in terms of supporting the operations of foreign-invested enterprises, but weaknesses, especially rising wage costs and skill shortages, will persist and exacerbate. The country's advantages as a cost-efficient base for labour-intensive production will quickly vanish amid growing competition from its low-income neighbours such as Cambodia, Myanmar and Vietnam, which also happen to boast a large workforce.
Labour shortages threaten the implementation of "Thailand 4.0"
- Shortages of labour trained to work in high-value industries will continue to pose a huge problem to the government's "Thailand 4.0" policy ambitions, which are premised on developing the country's advanced technology sectors. These skilled labour problems stem in large part from Thailand's underperforming education system, which ranks poorly both globally and regionally. Educational reforms in the last two decades have been poorly and inconsistently implemented, and there are currently still no plans for a major overhaul of the system. The ability of the labour force to meet the needs of businesses (in terms of specialist skills) is therefore likely to remain below global standards. In view of this situation, hiring skilled foreign workers will become easier with the government set to relax visa restrictions, especially for the research and technology sectors during the forecast period.
- From January 2017 the nationwide daily minimum-wage schedule was replaced by minimum wages per province. The range of the wage floor was raised to Bt313-336 (around US$10) with effect from January 2020. Further increases in the minimum wage will be frozen amid the pandemic and rising unemployment in 2020-21. Despite long-standing opposition in parliament and among business associations owing to the damage it would incur on private sector costs and Thailand's regional competitiveness, we expect the government to yet again succeed in raising the minimum wage in 2022-24 as a populist measure to appease the working class.

A poorly skilled workforce will remain the biggest issue in 2020-24
- Thailand is facing the social and economic consequences of a rapidly ageing society, including a steadily declining workforce as a share of the total population. The new government will introduce steps to mitigate this crisis towards the end of the forecast period. Proposals advocating a staggered increase in the retirement age of civil servants-from 60 years to 63-will be fully implemented in 2024. Civil servants can also now voluntarily delay their retirement by up to 10 years. These policies will invariably put pressure on private employers to follow suit. However, stagnant productivity will prevent such measures from adequately addressing related issues, such as the increasing financial burden of elderly care.
- Migrant workers account for over 10% of the total labour force prior to the pandemic, according to the UN. These workers typically come from neighbouring Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, and fill low-skilled vacancies in industries such as agriculture, construction and domestic work. We expect the size of the local labour force to rise in Thailand post-pandemic, when they are allowed to return, with businesses set to become even more reliant on cheaper migrant workers. This will also be driven by the development of SEZs, which the government has opened in border areas in order to capitalise on the supply of low-cost migrant labour from neighbouring countries. As a result, tensions will inevitably rise between local and migrant workers on issues of mistreatment and locals' resentment of job losses to migrant labourers. International concern over potential human rights abuses in Thailand, especially in the fishing industry, have resulted in stronger protective measures for migrant workers, but the UN still reports exploitation.

Thailand's infrastructure score will experience a marked improvement in the next five years. This will propel the country to 52nd in 2020-24 from 57th in 2015-19. Concurrent developments in neighbouring countries, however, will keep the country's regional ranking unchanged, at 10th. The military-aligned government will expedite smaller community work projects while continuing to bet on long-pending "megaprojects" for faster growth, although the latter will still face occasional delays. Improvements in telecommunications services have also been slow. Although 4G coverage is widely available, average speeds remain slow by regional comparison. Electricity supplies have risen, but the potential for shortages remains. At present, over 70% of the country's electricity is generated using natural gas, according to the Energy Policy and Planning Office, making the country vulnerable to fluctuations in global gas prices.
Infrastructure will be a key pillar of the government's plan for recovery
- The government has faced delays in the financing and implementation stages of its ambitious infrastructure development megaprojects, owing to issues with land acquisition, environmental impact and commercial viability. This includes the much-vaunted Thai section of the high-speed railway linking Thailand and China, via Laos, which had still not started as at August 2020, despite a decade of planning. Elsewhere, regional transport projects have faced similar delays owing to wrangling over financing with Chinese and Japanese investors. This partly reflects the government's efforts to take advantage of the ongoing competition for geopolitical influence between the two countries in order to secure the best deal. We expect these dynamics to result in uneven progress on priority projects in 2020-24. Thailand's more difficult financial position after the pandemic also means that the conditionality of loans and terms of repayment will feature more prominently in the government's decision to greenlight certain projects at the expense of others.
- The state-run management company, Airports of Thailand, faces a dismal year in 2020, as its finances have been hit hard by the pandemic. This, in addition to the halt of international travel since March 2020, will derail the planned upgrade of the country's three major airports. The airport expansion in Bangkok will still complete by 2024, but the construction of new airports in Chiang Mai and Phuket will likely only materialise beyond the end of the forecast period.

5G networks will be key part of the ambitious "Thailand 4.0" initiative
- The pandemic has spurred development of 5G networks in Thailand, and the country now leads its ASEAN counterparts in the 5G race. Two operators have already launched 5G networks across hospitals in major cities and powered robots for telemedicine. These developments will put Thailand on track to meet its regulator's optimistic forecast that it will be able to provide commercial 5G services by end-2020.

Thailand will experience an improvement in its technological readiness score in 2020-24, which boosts its global rankings by three places, to 42nd. The change reflects our expectations that the government will increase its investments in R&D, STEM education and continue to improve the digital infrastructure in 2020-24. To fulfil the government's "Thailand 4.0" goals, it will scale up incentives for international companies to set up research bases inside the country. However, internet use will exert a fundamental drag on Thailand's performance. Although the number of internet users per 100 population has increased to 60.2 in 2019, it remains below those of Malaysia (81.2) and the Philippines (66). This limits Thailand's viability for e-commerce and digital services.
Benefits of digitisation will probably stay within urban areas
- The government has outlined plans to pursue digital infrastructure projects initiated by the junta as part of the Thailand 4.0 strategy and the 20-year digital roadmap. These include projects to bring national broadband to 25,000 remote communities, in order to develop rural areas and to give private-sector enterprises access to public infrastructure. Progress on this front will continue to be sluggish as escalating costs and the poor quality of wifi hotspots plague the project. State telecommunications company, TOT, has been blacklisted by the government following its failure to deliver broadband to these villages on time. As a result, any socio-economic transformation to be brought about by 5G internet in the forecast period will be limited to the big cities and their surrounding areas.
- The Board of Investment will likely step up incentives, such as import duty exemptions on raw materials used in R&D, to expedite the development of innovative capacities in the private sector, which has long shown a lack of commercial acumen in deployment of technology. Companies focused on biotechnology, nanotechnology, advanced materials or digital technology are also eligible for up to 13 years' exemption from corporate income tax if they co-operate with public research institutions in R&D.

Economic forecast: Policy trends As an urgent matter, the government will focus on implementing fiscal stimulus measures, comprising three components: tax breaks; the facilitation of bank loans in the form of collateral guarantees and concessionary rates; and direct handouts for those businesses and households worst hit by the pandemic. Industry-specific stimulus plans, in particular for the tourism sector, will also feature high on the government's agenda in the second half of the year as the economy reopens fully.
After the pandemic, the government will-in a similar way to the junta that preceded it-return to its priority of boosting the country's medium-to-long-term investment prospects as a sophisticated manufacturing and technology hub, partly through increased public spending on infra-structure. This will include the development of the EEC, based on new and upgraded transport links. The initiative will also cover the continuation of the sector-specific Thailand 4.0 industrial policy, which will provide significant tax and working-visa incentives for foreign investors in knowledge-intensive industries within and outside the EEC. This business-friendly policy will also manifest itself in the government's renewed pursuit of FTAs and bilateral investment treaties with major trading partners. However, this aspiration of reinventing Thailand as a high-technology economy will face severe headwinds-most notably the lack of skilled labour and fierce competition from regional peers such as South Korea and Taiwan.

Government revenue 15.2 13.3 15.0 16.2 16.5 16.8
Budget balance -1.9 -6.4 -5.2 -3.6 -2.7 -2.1
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the budget deficit to stand at the equivalent of 6.4% of GDP in 2020, which will be the largest deficit in 30 years. The government estimates its multiple rounds of parliament-approved stimulus packages to be worth around Bt2.5trn (US$79bn). We do not expect further significant stimulus measures in the remainder of 2020 and 2021.
The government has stated that it will issue Bt1trn in new debt (domestic and external) to finance the deficit in 2020. Total government debt as a share of GDP will jump from an estimated equivalent of 41.2% of GDP in 2019 to 53.5% of GDP in 2021.
Concerns over fiscal sustainability, amid rising debt servicing, will lead to a tightening fiscal stance from 2021. We forecast the budget deficit to average 3.4% of GDP per year in 2021-24. Increased infrastructure spending and investment will form the bulk of rising government expenditure. Stronger trade growth in 2022-24 will boost revenue from import and export duties and help to ensure that the deficit does not exceed 4% of GDP in this period. A likely increase in value-added tax (VAT) in the latter part of the forecast period, from the current rate of 7%, will also bolster revenue.

We expect the Bank of Thailand (BOT, the central bank) to reduce its policy rate, the one-day repurchase rate, throughout this year to near zero. The central bank cut the rate by 75 basis points between February and May, to a new record low of 0.5%, and we expect it to reduce the rate by another 25 basis points in September. It will only sanction gradual rate rises from 2022, as domestic and external economic conditions strengthen.
The BOT also mandated concessionary rates for loans to low-income house-holds and relaxed the conditions on loan repayments for small businesses.
The central bank is likely to scale up new forms of open-market operations that involve purchases of government and corporate assets, with the aim of supporting govern-ment financing and reassuring investors about the continued robustness of the country's financial system. It set up a Corporate Bond Stabilisation Fund in April with the aim of bolstering liquidity, and has already conducted two rounds of purchases.

Economic forecast: Economic growth The impact of the coronavirus: global and regional assumptions The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecasts are built on a series of epidemiological assumptions about the novel coronavirus (Covid-19). Without rapid access to a vaccine, we expect that the disease will eventually infect up to 30% of the world's population; of the symptomatic cases, we assume that around 15% will be severe and up to 1% will prove fatal. Death ratios will depend on a country's ability to detect, track and contain the virus and the capacity of its national health system. Governments are lifting restrictions on freedom of movement gradually in countries where the number of cases is falling. Some countries may be forced to re-impose measures if the number of cases spikes again. Based on previous viral outbreaks and the progress made on other coronavirus vaccines (such as that for severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS), we expect a vaccine to be available by end-2021.
We forecast that global real GDP will contract by 5% year on year in 2020. We believe that trade disruption will remain severe and forecast that global trade will contract by 22.6%. We assume that oil prices will decline by about 37% this year, to average US$40.5/barrel, before they recover to US$45/b next year. Real GDP will contract in all regions in 2020, but the drop in output will be especially severe in OECD countries, at 6.3%. All G7 countries and all but two G20 countries (China and Indonesia) will experience a full-year recession, and the US's output will contract by 5.3%. Asian countries will recover most quickly, with some (including India and South Korea) returning to pre-coronavirus GDP levels in 2021. Of the G7 countries, Germany's output will also be back to 2019 levels in 2021, but others will recover more slowly, with GDP returning to 2019 levels in 2022 for Canada, France and the US, 2023 for the UK and 2024 for Italy and Japan. Most countries have responded with fiscal programmes to support businesses and households, raising the risk of sovereign debt crises in the medium term. Central banks have cut interest rates and, more importantly, have stepped up as buyers of last resort for government and corporate debt.
Asia and Australasia will experience a recession in 2020 for the first time since 1998, with regional real GDP forecast to contract by 1.8%. All countries in the region will see their economic performance affected by demand slumps caused by lockdowns within their own borders and those introduced in other countries. Among the region's major markets, Singapore is forecast to experience the steepest economic contraction in 2020, at 6%, followed by India, Thailand and Japan. Some trade-dependent economies, such as South Korea and Taiwan, will evince a degree of economic resilience because their early response to the pandemic allowed them to avoid costly nationwide lockdowns. Parts of Asia are still expected to post GDP growth in 2020, albeit at a much less rapid rate than normal. Vietnam's economy will grow by 3.3% this year, while China's is forecast to expand by 1.4%, despite a steep economic contraction in January-March. While the pace of recovery will be sequentially weak in Asia in 2021, with many countries still forced to implement localised (if not national) lockdowns, a low comparison base will help to ensure that real GDP rebounds to growth of 5.5% that year.
The political and geopolitical effects of the crisis will be significant. The pandemic has resulted in an extraordinary expansion of executive powers, with limited parliamentary oversight. Elections have been cancelled or delayed in some countries. When the pandemic has passed, governments' handling of the response will face scrutiny. Failure to address the humanitarian crisis triggered by the coronavirus could further erode trust in national institutions. A severe global economic crisis, followed by large-scale unemployment, could fuel a new wave of popular protests. The crisis may encourage support for the nation state and a backlash against globalisation and open borders. It will also intensify the competition for global leadership between China and the US, and a realignment of geopolitical spheres of influence may ensue in Europe, Africa and other region.
Thailand has been in a state of emergency since March 24th, which grants the prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, the power to enforce measures restricting some rights and liberties normally guaranteed by the constitution. His emergency decree has banned public gatherings, including protests, as well as publications that are deemed to cause public unrest. The government has also denied entry to all foreigners except holders of residential and some business visas. Since mid-May, however, most shops and malls have reopened, and the country has also started to allow domestic travel, as the pandemic appears to have been brought under control. The total number of cases remained at around 3,200 at the end of July, as the daily total of new cases had fallen to single digits. Despite an apparent improvement in the situation, the government is likely to extend the emergency decree for another month, to end-August. This has raised fears that Prayuth could take advantage of the crisis to crack down on his political opponents, amid growing criticism of his government's early response to the outbreak.

We expect the economy to shrink by 5.3% this year amid the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, which will curtail Thailand's export revenue-most notably in its tourism sector. Consumer spending will also suffer as unemployment and pay cuts in the external sector mount.
We expect exports of goods and services to contract by 14.9% in real terms in 2020. The steep decline will be driven mainly by the loss of 70% of tourism revenue, as we expect inflows of Asian tourists to begin to recover only towards the end of 2020, with a full recovery not expected until 2022. This partly results from the fact that it will take much longer for Western tourists to return, considering the longer-lasting damage to those economies. Export volumes for both merchandise and services will rebound robustly but not fully in 2021, posting growth of 11.9% as external demand picks up again.
The stimulus packages in 2020 will help to slow the contraction, but not significantly. Facing an inevitably damaging decline in domestic and external demand, the measures are primarily about preventing widespread bankruptcy and cushioning the blow to livelihoods, rather than boosting output.
In the medium term, Thai automotive exporters are likely to reap moderate benefits as multinationals diversify their regional supply chains. This will partly reflect strategies to mitigate US-China trade tensions, which are likely to intensify despite the "first-phase" trade agreement between those countries. The shock from the coronavirus outbreak has also demonstrated the risks of over-reliance on China-centric supply chains. Following a year of recovery in 2021, we expect trade growth to firm further from 2022 as producers of parts and vehicles start to move up the value chain through knowledge-intensive manufacturing, and as the development of the EEC strengthens Thailand's competitiveness.
Total fixed investment will contract by 7.6% in 2020, as businesses struggle to stay afloat amid a substantial decline in demand. Foreign capital will shun fixed assets in emerging markets (which are seen as risky at a time of uncertainty) in favour of safer and more liquid alternatives. The government is prioritising cushioning the blow, rather than boosting investment growth. With a decent economic recovery beginning in 2021, we expect investment growth to average 5% a year in 2021-24. This is because of our assumption of overarching political stability, which will ensure policy continuity, including a focus on major infrastructure upgrades. A large share of this will take place within the EEC under the Thailand 4.0 initiative, which should encourage additional investment by private businesses.
Private consumption will contract by 3.1% in 2020 amid mass unemployment in the tourism sector and quarantine measures. Even after a strengthening of the economy takes shape from 2021, high levels of personal debt and a relatively high share of the workforce in lower-wage agriculture will continue to constrain household spending prospects. This will ensure that private consumption grows at a markedly slower pace in Thailand than in many of its regional peers in 2022-24.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends On the supply side of the economy, we expect the industrial sector to grow at an annual average of 2% in 2020-24. The coronavirus pandemic has dealt a heavy blow to Thailand's export-oriented manufacturing sector, in particular the automotive industry. A weakening in global demand, which will not fully recover until at least 2022, will weigh on growth in the industrial sector in 2020-21. In the latter part of the forecast period, industrial production will accelerate amid increased public investment in infrastructure. Thailand will likely not benefit significantly from the relocation of supply chains away from China amid ongoing US-China trade tensions. This reflects concerns over the country's increasingly expensive labour and a relatively small pool of skilled workers compared to the rapidly growing regional economies.
The services sector will continue to be dominated by tourism The services sector will grow by an annual average of 1.5% in 2020-24. Tourism, which accounts for over 70% of Thailand's services exports, will suffer a historic decline in 2020 and not recover fully until at least 2022. We expect onerous travel restrictions and quarantine measures to remain in place until early 2021, which will essentially halt inbound tourism. During such time, the importance of tourists from China and domestic tourism will grow. We expect China to emerge in relatively good shape from the pandemic in 2021. Stronger rates of growth in this subsector will eventually resume in the latter part of the forecast period, as Thailand's retains its attraction as a key tourist destination.
Meanwhile, the financial sector will remain relatively healthy. Although the ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) to total loans is likely to surge amid the pandemic, the sector will be able to weather the storm with its adequate capitalisation and a competent central bank. However, household debt remains elevated, which will crimp demand and dampen the expansion of the sector as a whole in 2020-24. In the first quarter of 2020 household debt rose to 79.8% of GDP, from 79.1% in late 2019. Elsewhere, the telecoms segment industry will see strong growth towards the end of the forecast period as the consumer electronics cycle recovers from its slump and the rollout of 5G networks is mostly completed. This will allow firms to meet surging demand for mobile internet services and will dovetail with the continued expansion of e-commerce platforms in the country.
The agriculture sector will remain vulnerable to extreme weather cycles, including droughts and floods. Productivity is also likely to suffer as tentative efforts to reform the sector are repeatedly set back by implementation issues and lack of government attention, which will also mean that producers are largely unable to upgrade from current basic technologies. Some industries, such as fishing, will struggle early in the forecast period as the industry adapts to Western countries' market-access requirements regarding labour rights. These weaknesses will ensure that farmers remain an important interest group for the new government. We expect the agriculture sector to grow by an annual average of 2.1% in 2020-24.
Economic forecast: Inflation % 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024
Consumer prices 0.7 -0.2 1.1 1.7 1.8 1.5
Average wages 2.3 -2.0 6.0 4.5 3.7 3.1
Real wages 1.6 -1.8 4.8 2.8 1.9 1.6
Labour costs per hour (US$) 3.2 3.0 3.2 3.4 3.5 3.6
Consumer prices will experience deflation in 2020, at -0.2%, for the first time since 2015. This reflects the impact of declining global commodity prices, which we expect to remain low until 2021. Price pressures will weaken further this year against the backdrop of a rare fall in domestic demand, prompted by the coronavirus-related lockdown.
Stronger global economic activity and rising energy prices thereafter will help to lift average annual inflation to 1.7% in 2022-24. This rate will remain well below that of Thailand's regional peers, mainly reflecting underwhelming growth in household consumption.

Dim prospects for the economy amid the pandemic, particularly in the tourism sector, have undermined investor sentiment towards the local currency, the baht, since the beginning of the year. This will result in an overall weakening of the currency against the US dollar in 2020 compared with the pre-coronavirus level last year. However, Thailand's persistent current-account surplus and foreign-exchange reserves will lend strong support to the exchange rate throughout the forecast period, ensuring that any depreciation remains mild and transitory (including the one related to the pandemic earlier this year). The BOT will also continue to intervene to prevent excessive volatility in the baht. These factors will help to stabilise the currency at around Bt31.5:US$1 in the latter part of the forecast period.

We expect the current-account surplus to narrow to 3.4% of GDP in 2020, amid a deep recession. The drastic decline in inbound tourism resulting from the coronavirus outbreak will contribute to this, as the services account is set to record a rare and sizable deficit. A broad slowdown in exports, driven by the pandemic-induced global recession, will also result in a consider-able fall in outbound merchandise shipments, which will be offset slightly by a surge in demand for gold and electronics products amid worldwide lockdowns. Nonetheless, an even steeper decline in imports, attributable in part to tumbling global oil prices, will ensure a widening trade surplus compared with 2019.
Merchandise shipping and inbound tourism will post a strong recovery in 2021 as the coronavirus outbreak fades. Thereafter, the current-account surplus will average 7.4% of GDP per year in 2022-24. This will broadly mirror fluctuations in the trade surplus, which will be determined in large part by global oil prices and external demand for Thai goods.
The primary income account will remain firmly in deficit in 2020-24, reflecting the continued repatriation of profits and dividends by foreign-owned firms. The wide deficit will be reduced slightly by a consistent surplus on the secondary income account from personal transfers, notably remittances.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Thailand Stocks and flows Net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows had increased steadily in 2015-19, owing to a more stable political environment and the previous junta's efforts to attract infrastructure investment, which included a range of incentives and the liberalisation of strategic industries. The coronavirus (Covid-19) shock will halt such growth in 2020, but expectations of policy continuity under Prayuth's government and gradual recovery of external demand should see an increase in inflows from 2021, assuming that the pandemic eases by then. Outward investment, particularly to countries within the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), is also expected to increase later in the forecast period after the pandemic. In 2019 the stock of inward FDI stood at US$268bn, equivalent to 49.3% of GDP, while the stock of outward FDI stood at US$152bn.
Origin and distribution The private manufacturing sector has traditionally attracted the largest proportion of FDI into Thailand. In particular, manufacturers of automotive parts and producers of electronics and electrical appliances have attracted significant foreign interest. In recent years, however, the financial and real-estate sectors have also gained prominence, particularly as industrial production faces bottlenecks and weak external conditions prevail even before the pandemic. Japanese firms retain their position as the main investors in Thailand, but investment from China has greatly increased in the past few years. Chinese investors, at least as much as their Japanese counterparts, are likely to gain from Thailand's infrastructure development plans, but this will come in the form of vendor contracts in construction, logistics planning and technology.
Determinants Thailand has traditionally been an attractive investment destination, owing to its relatively decent infrastructure, flexible labour laws and advantageous location within the region. Nonetheless, any sign of political instability, which remains a persistent risk, as well as growing regional competition, will pose challenges to Thailand's attractiveness in the medium term. The Board of Investment (BOI) offers incentives, which generally take the form of exemptions from corporate income tax and reduced taxes on imported machinery. The BOI also offers non-tax incentives, including granting permission to bring in foreign workers, to own land and to take or remit foreign currency abroad. Indeed, the new large-scale Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) special economic zone (SEZ) includes fast-tracked environmental assessments as an incentive. Thailand has generally been regarded as one of the most open economies in the region to foreign investment. The BOI's seven-year investment promotion strategy, launched in 2015, has continued to extend incentives to newer industries such as "alternative energy and environmental services" and "hospitality and wellness", while removing existing incentives in certain low-value, labour-intensive industries. The BOI has also been encouraging investment into infrastructure, through a number of big-ticket projects. In addition, it has expedited the investment application and approval process in recent years, and is likely to retain this as a priority to lure back foreign investors after the pandemic. Disagreements from lawmakers and sometimes within the governing coalition will slow the pace of decision-making on investment related to expensive infrastructure mega-projects.
Impact Large FDI inflows have helped to support overall economic growth and have contributed to Thailand's development as a leading exporter to other countries in Asia in a number of sectors, including vehicles (particularly light pick-up trucks), electronics (especially computer parts) and electrical appliances. Reliance on FDI has nonetheless compounded the economy's already significant exposure to external conditions.
Potential Thailand's political scene has stabilised since the public approval of the junta-drafted constitution in a referendum in 2016 and the smooth accession of the new king. After a brief period of uncertainty around the election held in March 2019, political stability will be maintained in 2020-24. Serious challenges to the new political structure are unlikely to materialise before 2023, which bodes well for steady FDI flows in the forecast period. The volatile nature of Thailand's politics will remain a risk, however. A number of other challenges may limit the potential for strong growth in FDI in the next five years. Thailand's attractiveness as a location for investment has been diminishing because of a rising relative cost base (particularly for labour) and sluggish domestic demand compared to other markets in the region. Although the current administration will maintain the junta's commitment to liberalisation, mainly through the legally binding 20-year National Strategy, access to strategic sectors such as telecommunications, media and utilities remains difficult. The standard of infrastructure in the country has improved in recent years, but it remains inferior to Malaysia, a rival manufacturing location, while poorer competitors such as Vietnam begin to catch up. The junta-drafted infrastructure development programme, which the government will follow, will rectify this shortfall to a degree. Thailand will continue to attract foreign investment by virtue of its leading position in the development of the ASEAN Free-Trade Area, but there is a rising risk that it may lose out to others in the region as they make improvements to their business environments at a faster rate.

Effective family-planning programmes and changing social norms, such as later marriage and smaller families, will keep Thailand's average population growth rate relatively low, at 0.2% a year, in the forecast period. By 2024 the population is forecast to reach 70.3m, with females accounting for 51.5% of the total. Owing to continued improvements in healthcare and childbirth procedures, the infant mortality rate will drop to an average of 8.2 per 1,000 live births in the forecast period, from 9.2 per 1,000 in 2015-19. Life expectancy will also improve, with men expected to live for an average of 73.5 years in 2020-24, up from 72.2 in 2015-19, while female life expectancy will rise from an average of 79.6 to 80.9 years over the same period.
Demographic ageing will raise pressure on healthcare provision and finances Thailand's population is ageing, with the proportion aged under 15 falling steadily from 2011. Meanwhile, the proportion aged over 65 is set to grow to 15.3% in 2024, up from 12.3% in 2019. This will mean that the young-age dependency ratio falls to 0.22 in 2024, from 0.25 in 2014, while the old-age dependency ratio rises from 0.14 to 0.22 over the same period. This demographic trend will place further strain on healthcare provision. The country's health system is structured around a universal healthcare scheme that was introduced in 2001 and has been free for all citizens since 2006. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects this scheme to remain free in the forecast period. It will, nonetheless, face growing burdens resulting from the country's rising levels of air pollution and ageing population.
Road accidents will continue to be a leading cause of death The crude death rate is forecast at 8.3 per 1,000 in 2020-24. Non-communicable illnesses such as heart disease, stroke and respiratory diseases are responsible for 74% of all deaths in Thailand, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). The WHO also reports in 2015 that Thailand has the world's second-highest road traffic fatality rate, at 36.2 per 100,00 population. Deteriorating air quality-pollution levels in Bangkok and northern provinces hit record highs in recent years, including 2019-also poses a threat of increased premature deaths and health burdens. Meanwhile, Thailand continues to confront the challenge of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, which emerged as the country's leading cause of death in the early 2000s. The UNAIDS estimates the death rate from the disease at around 21 per 100,000 people in 2019, although 470,000 people continued to live with the disease in that year. Other infectious diseases, such as cholera, measles and mumps, have become less common but have not been eradicated.
The labour market will tighten owing to the ageing of Thailand's population, and shortages of skilled labour are likely to become more pronounced in the next five years. The size of the labour force will contract slowly, dropping to 37.5m by 2024, owing to a decline in the working-age population. Migrant labour will return from an anticipated hiatus in 2020 and remain abundant post-pandemic, with workers from neighbouring Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos dominating unskilled jobs in the construction industry and as household employees. However, Thailand will gradually become a less attractive destination for unskilled migrants over the long term. In the near term, this will partly reflect a less welcoming stance on the part of the authorities and the general public, who are keen to channel unskilled migrant labour into legitimate strategic industries in border-located special economic zones. In the longer term, job opportunities in Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos will expand as those economies record faster growth than Thailand
Rural-urban migration is still a significant demographic trend Despite slow population growth, the number of households in Thailand is expected to rise strongly in the forecast period, with a subsequent reduction in average household size. Internal migration and changing social patterns mean that it is increasingly common for households to consist of nuclear rather than extended families. Steady economic expansion in recent years has encouraged this trend, as migrant workers from rural areas have been moving to the major cities, and particularly the metropolitan area centred on the capital, Bangkok. Although Bangkok remains the main focus for the urban population, other cities, including Surat Thani, Chiang Mai and Hat Yai, have also been growing rapidly. The share of rural population stood at almost 50% in 2019 according to the World Bank, which is quite high by the standard of middle-income countries. This means that further expansion of metropolitan cities amid growing urbanisation will continue to feature as a prominent demographic theme in the forecast period.

Thailand constitutes a sizeable market in its own right, with a population of 69.6m and nominal GDP equivalent to around US$543.8bn at market exchange rates in 2019. Moreover, the development of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free-Trade Area means that goods exported from Thailand will continue to enjoy almost entirely duty-free access to ASEAN's market of 500m, including a burgeoning middle class with growing disposable income.
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that aggregate personal disposable income will grow at a slower rate in 2020-24 than it did in 2015-19, primarily because disposable income will suffer a rare fall in 2020 amid the pandemic. Growth will resume in 2021 at a steady pace. A more alarming challenge in the longer term will be the wide wealth gap, which will widen with lower socio-economic groups being disproportionately affected by the ongoing pandemic. According to the latest data from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), of the 9.9% of the population defined as living below the nationally defined poverty line in 2018, the majority reside in the rural north and north-eastern parts of the country. This number will only grow in the aftermath of the pandemic, and it will take several years for it to come down again. The capital, Bangkok, remains the wealthiest region by far. Structural issues, such as the fact that opportunities in rural areas remain limited compared with urban centres, will remain largely unaddressed.
High household debt will limit growth in consumption in 2020-24 Household spending will be tempered by still-high personal debt. In particular, debt burdens among those on lower incomes have a significant negative impact on consumer demand overall and limit the prospects for social mobility among this group. This will particularly affect the share available for spending on consumer goods, ensuring that Thailand's retail goods market experiences relatively low growth compared to its neighbours. Following a year of relatively modest growth in 2021, the release of pent-up demand will help to underpin retail sales in 2022-23, as the economy fully rebounds from a deep pandemic-induced recession. On average, retail sales volumes will grow by 2.5% a year in 2020-24.

Private consumption will grow by an annual average of 2.9% in 2020-24, slower than the rate of 3.5% in 2015-19. In the early part of the forecast period, a fall in household income and macroeconomic uncertainty amid the pandemic will dampen consumer sentiment. In 2020-21 the government will expand policies aimed at supporting consumption through cheap loans and cash handouts aimed at helping low-income and unemployed citizens. Given the frail state of private consumption, the value-added tax (VAT) rate is likely to be frozen at the current level of 7% until later in the forecast period. The government will finance such emergency measures by running a larger budget deficit and increasing borrowing. Meanwhile, higher "sin taxes" on sugar, alcohol and tobacco will have a minor impact on the consumption pattern of the population at large.
Discretionary spending will remain low in the early parts of the forecast period Consumer expenditure on essential items, such as food, household goods and clothing, will rise as a proportion of total expenditure as average incomes fall and remain stagnant in the early parts of the forecast period. The average individual outlay on hotels and restaurants is likely to see a marked decline as a result of a much reduced number of international tourists in 2020-21. This will only be marginally offset by government efforts to promote domestic tourism as foreign tourists tend to spend more on this category on average. A similar situation applies to other categories of discretionary expenditure such as leisure, which will plunge in 2020 and not return to pre-pandemic level until 2022. Growth in healthcare spending is forecast to increase steadily in 2020-24 with an ageing population in the forecast period. The projected increase in spending on transport and communications will largely reflect the expanding market for and popularisation of information technology (IT) products, which will be boosted by faster and cheaper internet services following state-led upgrades.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Initial conditions: The past two decades have been characterised by political turmoil, with coups in 2006 and 2014 and many (sometimes violent) anti-government protests and rallies. Economic growth has been volatile in the years since the 2008-09 global financial crisis owing to natural disasters and political crises. Physical infrastructure remains inadequate in many respects. Reform of the education system has long been promised, but successive governments have largely failed to modernise the quality of teaching or the curriculum. The workforce is therefore characterised by a low level of technical skills-a problem made worse by rapidly demographic ageing. On top of these long-standing structural issues, the current government will also have to deal with a battered economy in the aftermath of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.
Demographic trends: Slower population growth and longer life expectancies will account for the ageing population. While female labour force participation rate will have risen by 2030, this will not prevent an average annual contraction of almost 1% in the labour force in 2031-50. Nevertheless, a gradual loosening of regulation concerning immigrants' right to work, especially in skilled positions, will preclude a steeper fall in the size of the workforce. Successive governments are likely to be forced to ease immi-gration and long-term visa policies further, owing to the country's negative demographic profile. The effectiveness of this will be limited by concerns among immigrants regarding rising inter-ethnic tensions, worsening air pollution and the growing attractiveness of neighbouring regions.
External conditions: Thailand faces a challenging external environment in the period to 2050. Although many export-oriented, labour-intensive industries will shift away from China, Thailand will struggle to capitalise on this opportunity owing to a lack of competitiveness compared with lower-cost locations, such as Cambodia and Vietnam. New regional rivals will also gain ground, including Laos and Myanmar. Closer integration with China could open up market opportunities for Thai businesses in more niche subsectors. One possibility is that Thailand may develop itself as a services centre for China, meeting that country's increasing demand for foreign holidays, regional-specific agricultural goods and other niche products. The government is already spearheading a move in that direction under its "Thailand 4.0" industrial policy and, in part, via its new Eastern Economic Corridor special economic zone (SEZ). This is particularly the case for the tourism sector, and the ongoing expansion of transport infrastructure will go some way to supporting these aims. Similarly, economic and trade links will be strengthened by the development of overland transport routes between China and Thailand in the next decade or so. The development of the ASEAN Economic Community, formally established in 2015, will motivate business and technical innovation in Thailand to the degree that the country retains its prominence in the region. In 2020-30 a relocation of regional supply chains will pick up pace amid increased trade and geopolitical tensions. Although Thailand will benefit from these shifts, gains will be limited by the attractiveness of regional competitors such as Taiwan and Vietnam.
Institutions and policy trends: In the coming decades, there will be no resolution of the power struggle between the established military and older bureaucratic elites in the capital, Bangkok, who will continue to side with the palace to bolster their legitimacy, and the rural as well as younger masses that form the majority of the Thai electorate. The level of political tension will depend on successive governments' ability to restructure the economy further away from agriculture and tourism, not least by moving a far greater proportion of the workforce into high-value industry and services. Democratically elected governments might be successful in instigating such a shift with the introduction of appropriate electoral reform, as well as a focus on medium-to-long-term rural development policies, rather than just short-term relief measures.
Long-term performance: The long-term outlook for Thailand's economy is heavily dependent on whether future governments prove capable of initiating and implementing the required structural reform that will continue into the medium-to-long term, while also upgrading infrastructure. Liberalisation in a number of important sectors, such as power and communications, will help Thailand to regain some of its competiveness relative to its regional neighbours. The effects of an ageing population on the budget could be offset by greater use of advanced healthcare technology and 5G-enabled technologies. On the issue of boosting productivity to rival Thailand's competitors, the government could improve educational attainment on the part of the existing workforce. However, progress is likely to be slow in both areas. A more probable and effective measure would be greater immigrant access to the labour market, although rising ethnic tensions could undermine its implementation.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Thailand published a long-term climate change adaptation plan in 2015, entitled the Climate Change Master Plan 2015-50. It outlines a three-pronged approach divided into mitigation, adaptation and capacity-building targets. The near-term goals included setting emission-reduction targets and establishing incentives for low-carbon-emission development. Medium-term targets included reaching at least 25% of energy consumption from renewable sources. Longer-term targets are vaguer, with general goals to increase private investment in green industries and to reduce the carbon intensity of the economy. In line with this plan, Thailand signed and ratified the Paris Agreement of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) in 2016, committing to specific targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Under COP21, Thailand has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% from the projected business-as-usual forecast by 2030. The latest government figures in 2020 show reasonable results in the country's push to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. More crucial to meeting the climate target by 2050 will be more far-reaching and costly measures, such as carbon pricing.
The main determinant of emissions levels in Thailand in the coming decades will continue to be energy sourcing. Coal-fired power plants generate close to one-fifth of the country's electricity, while lesser-polluting liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation. Most of these plants are situated in the south of the country. The government will continue to push for the expansion of renewable energy sources as a share of the country's energy mix, and renewable energy is likely to account for around one-quarter of total generation capacity by 2040. The commissioning of nuclear power plants in Thailand, which would reduce reliance on high-polluting forms, is also a possibility. However, the relatively low prices of coal and gas will mean that these continue to account for the majority of energy generation over the next two decades.
The country, especially its most economically productive areas including Bangkok, will be vulnerable to the intensified impact of climate change in the coming decades. This will be felt most acutely through the rising sea level, flooding, droughts and air pollution, which will in turn feed into economic insecurity, infrastructure strains, health burdens and social unrest. In 2019 we developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth. Our latest calculations find that the Thai economy will be 2.2% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth.
Technological developments In May 2016 the junta unveiled "Thailand 4.0", a sector-specific industrial policy that aims to attract new investment in the transformation of the economy. The name of the strategy describes the intended next stage in the sectoral development of the economy, characterised by the industrial application of state-of-the-art technology. It follows the current domestic industrial situation, which is dominated by heavy industry with advanced machinery, in segments such as automotive and chemicals production. While the pandemic in 2020 will force the government to make some changes to the initiative in the forecast period, the key focus of the Thailand 4.0 strategy in the longer term will return to strategic industries where value can be added via new technologies; these include smart electronics, high-income and medical tourism, agriculture and biotechnology, food and beverages, and the automotive industry. It will also extend to the development of new industries, such as robotics, aerospace, digital services, bioenergy and biochemicals, and healthcare. Incentives for investment in these sectors will remain in place for several years and are explicitly targeted towards the introduction of new technology, for example by offering import-duty exemption on capital goods for listed industries. Thailand will make some progress in upgrading its industries, but is likely to be constrained by a limited supply of skilled labour.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2015-19) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2020-24). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2015-19. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2020-24 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2015-19 ranges are then used to derive 2020-24 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2020-24, not to the likely situation in 2024 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2017 or 2022). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - The outbreak of the coronavirus resulted in the imposition of significant restrictions on economic activity and population, generating a recession in 2020, with output contracting by 5.5% for the full year. Fiscal stimulus measures, as well as a substantial decline in oil sector revenue, will generate a looser fiscal stance that will persist throughout the forecast period (2020-24).
- Norway has a history of coalition governments and cross-party consensus, delivering high levels of political stability. The constitution does not allow for the dissolution of parliament. The ruling coalition comprises the Conservatives, the Liberals and the Christian Democrats (KrF) as a minority government, with 61 seats in the 169-seat parliament. The next election is in September 2021, and The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the centre-right bloc to re-enter government, owing to its competent handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
- We expect real GDP to contract by 5.5% in 2020, owing to the fallout from the virus. We do not expect a reimposition of a lockdown even in the event of a revival of infections. The economy will recover from 2021 to 2024, reaching 2019 levels by 2023, and growth averaging 2.4% as restrictions on mobility recede.
- We estimate that inflation will soften to 1.2% on average in 2020, from 2.2% in 2019, owing to worsening economic conditions, but pressures on core inflation from rising food prices pose an upside risk to price growth. Economic recovery will generate a rebound in inflation throughout the forecast period, generating inflation averaging 1.6% in 2021-24.
- In March Norges Bank (the central bank) reversed much of its monetary tightening, lowering interest rates by a total of 125 basis points, to 0.25%. Core inflation is falling as demand declines, and rates are expected to remain stable until the end of 2020. A steady policy of normalisation will follow, with policy rates reaching 1.5% by 2024.

- Norway's business environment score rises slightly for 2020-24, as the economy has become more resilient following oil industry reforms. Backed by vast oil wealth, the political and economic environments are robust, and financing opportunities should remain firm. Norway lags regional peers owing to limited market opportunities, tight labour market regulation and high wages.

Country forecast overview: Norway's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: Low regulatory burden, but probable rise in already high level of state influence in the economy, following emergency policy measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic and related temporary lockdown.
2022-24: A strategic plan guides the Norwegian Competition Authority to raise sectoral competition and procurement rules.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Generally positive attitude towards attracting foreign direct investment, but capital inflows constrained by weak global economy and new domestic investment screening regime that can block investment on national security grounds.
2022-24: The economy further diversifies investor countries beyond Europe, although to limited effect.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: Absorbing the shock to global trade from the coronavirus will be a major theme, with a discussion around "reshoring" strategic industries away from China likely to follow the immediate crisis.
2022-24: No change in policy towards joining the EU or leaving the European Economic Area (EEA). A reassessment of EEA membership is possible, but unlikely. Efforts to promote bilateral trade deals continue.
Taxes 2020-21: Temporary stimulus measures and easing of tax-payment requirements for firms in response to coronavirus.
2022-24: Government investigates reform of subsidy regime for oil and gas exploration. Expansion of environmental taxes to meet climate change goals.
Financing 2020-21: Significant expansion of central bank liquidity to support functioning of financial markets. Policy interest rates remain at record-low level. Private-sector balance sheets weakened by economic fallout from the crisis.
2022-24: Credit demand likely to remain subdued following the crisis, but opportunities could emerge for growth of non-bank financing channels, including private equity and venture capital. Tighter anti-money-laundering rules.
The labour market 2020-21: The coronavirus shock leads to a sharp increase in unemployment
2022-24: Improvements in employment and wages follow the crisis. Skills shortages remain an issue in some sectors.
Infrastructure 2020-21: Government applies 12-year transport plan (2018-29) and raises funds available for maintenance and construction of infrastructure projects. Gradual roll-out of fifth-generation (5G) mobile services.
2022-24: Investments in new road and rail transport links are made. Digital infrastructure upgrades continue.
Technological developments 2020-21: Implementation of Norway's cyber-defence strategy, after cyber-attacks on national infrastructure.
2022-24: The Open Artificial Intelligence (AI) lab grows in size and importance, underpinning AI preparedness.

Background: The Labour Party governed almost continuously in 1935-65, dominating until 2001, when a minority coalition comprising the Conservatives, the Christian Democrats (KrF) and the Liberals swept to power. In 2005 Labour returned to office in a centre-left coalition with the Socialist Left Party (SV) and the Centre Party-the first majority government in two decades-lasting until 2009. The September 2013 election led to a regime change, with a minority right-of-centre coalition of the Conservatives and the Progress Party (FrP) taking office. The centre-right coalition was re-elected in 2017. The Conservatives and the FrP were joined by the Liberals in January 2018 and by the KrF in January 2019.
Political structure: There is no right of dissolution between elections. Norway uses a modified proportional representation system: 150 out of the 169 members of the unicameral Storting (parliament) are "district mandates" elected by open-list proportional representation. The remaining 19 seats, the "levelling mandates", are distributed only between the parties that get more than 4% of the national vote and whose initial seat count (out of 150) is not proportional to their share of the vote.
Policy issues: The centre-right government will try to implement additional business-friendly policies and tax cuts, focused on further reducing the negative spillover effects of lower oil prices on wider economic activity and on strengthening the mainland economy. Spending from Norway's oil fund is expected to rise, but it will remain comfortably within the country's fiscal guidelines. Despite a cross-party agreement on tackling climate change, tension will persist in the Storting over the balance between industrial development and environmental protection.
Taxation: At the start of 2016 most parties agreed on a multi-year corporation tax reduction (from 27% to 23% by 2018) to improve competitiveness in the economy; it has since been reduced to 22% in 2019. Oil companies pay an additional flat-rate tax of 50% on income derived from the extraction, processing and transport of oil, but benefit from a 78% tax refund on the costs of exploration for oil and gas. The capital-gains tax was cut from 28% to 27% in 2014. The ordinary rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 25%. The top marginal income tax rate is 54.3% (including employers' social security contributions).
Foreign trade: Oil and gas output and prices greatly affect Norway's trade flows. The petroleum industry contributes about half of total goods export revenue. In 2016 the trade account registered its lowest level since 1999, but has been recovering since. The current-account surplus increased to US$16.7bn in 2019, down from US$31.1bn in the previous year. The trade and current-account balance will remain in surplus throughout the forecast period (2020-24).

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The current ruling coalition, comprising the centre-right Conservatives and two small centrist parties-the Liberals and the Christian Democrats (KrF)-is coming to the end of its term in September 2021. The coalition rules as a minority government, with just 61 members in the 169-seat parliament, after the far-right Progress Party (FrP) withdrew from government in January 2020 after a coalition dispute over infrastructure. Given the nearing of the next general election, scheduled for September 2021, and a strong tradition of political consensus, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect a change in government.
Despite the government being a minority in parliament, it is able to pass legislation with the backing of the FrP (which has pledged to support it in significant parliamentary votes). The ruling coalition can also rely on the support of other opposition parties (such as the centre-left Labour Party). Although the FrP will probably withdraw its support for the government on some matters (preventing the proposal of some legislation), the damage to political stability would be low, as the constitution prohibits a pre-term dissolution of parliament, and therefore a snap election.
In the near term the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has strengthened the stabilising influences on the political outlook. The government has mostly unwound its restrictions on social interaction, after being among the first group of European countries to experience an outbreak of the disease. Public support for the ruling parties has strengthened markedly during the crisis, and political support for the lockdown was wide-ranging. Despite the economic disruption caused by the lockdown, there has been no increase in support for populist parties in Norway. Populist movements have historically had limited electoral appeal in the country, as the far-right FrP takes a largely pragmatic approach to government, in contrast with other European populist movements. Their presence has only a marginal impact on political stability, as the domestic political culture is highly consensus-driven, with frequent collaboration between the government and opposition parties on a range of issues.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch The next general election will be held in September 2021. The Storting (parliament) cannot be dissolved before completing a full four-year term, meaning that there is no risk of a snap election. A change in government is also not part of our forecast.
Although the handling of the coronavirus crisis is likely to shape political preferences in the run-up to the election, it is unclear how much of an effect it will have by September 2021. The governing bloc of right-wing parties (excluding the FrP) have seen their popular support increase in the wake of the pandemic, a feature common to most countries. We expect the government's competent handling of the coronavirus crisis to place the right-wing bloc in a good position before the election in 2021, although the decline in support for the FrP since 2017 means they may not be able to produce a stable majority.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations EU relations will remain a significant foreign policy issue, and may steadily encroach on domestic politics as environmental affairs become increasingly prominent. As a member of the European Economic Area, Norway has access to the single market (in exchange for contributions to the EU budget), but must accept relevant EU regulations while having limited influence over them. This has historically been accepted as a substitute for outright EU membership (which has been rejected twice in national referendums in 1972 and 1994), but mounting concern over economic diversification and a reduction in carbon emissions has pushed environmentalist parties (the Greens and the Liberals) to support outright EU membership. Although we do not expect Norway to join the EU without a national referendum, political pressure for a third plebiscite on the matter may grow in tandem with environmentalist influence in the government. Norway will be under continued pressure to raise its defence spending, which at 1.8% of GDP, is below NATO's 2% target. Greater commitments to increase spending will take time to implement, and will probably only be met by the end of 2024.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends The country has recorded a steady increase in coronavirus cases, in tandem with other European countries, since social distancing measures were largely unwound from June onwards. The number of new cases recorded each day rose from 9 on July 24th to 59 on August 8th. The increase in cases has primarily been among young people, meaning mortality rates remain low, but a substantial "second wave" of viral transmission (and death) through the wider population remains possible. The rise in cases has halted government efforts to loosen social distancing measures, and the imposition of regional controls (similar to those seen throughout Europe) is likely to form a component of the government's new anti-virus strategy.
Nevertheless, a revival in some control measures in economically concentrated areas (such as Oslo) remains a substantial risk to our economic forecast in 2020-21 and will probably curtail the extent of the recovery in headline output, as fear of infection will supress demand. Countervailing this, a rise in infections is likely to be met with a more robust public response. Although the lockdown has proved economically costly, it has given time for improvements in the capacity of the healthcare system and in a trace and quarantine system that will reduce the spread of the virus even without a vaccine.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy Like other European countries, Norway has announced fiscal stimulus in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, although this is much smaller than in peer economies. Given a long history of fiscal probity, Norway has a greater level of fiscal space than most, meaning that we expect public debt to remain below 60% of GDP throughout the forecast period. Total discretionary stimulus has amounted to about Nkr160bn (US$16bn), or about 5.5% of mainland GDP. The budget that the government presented in October 2019 has been abandoned as the disruption from the coronavirus generates a dual shock to both the mainland and oil sectors. The government's new budget, presented in mid-May, targets a substantial with-drawal from the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG; 4.2% of its value) to fund further expenditure, in breach of the government's fiscal rule to not withdraw more than 3% of the sovereign fund's value in any year. We expect that the government will have to lean on the fund for further fiscal support in the coming years, but this will not diminish its vast size. For the first time since 1993, this will not be enough to prevent a deficit in 2020, which we forecast at just 0.9% of GDP.
Existing government support for the labour market is similar to the measures implemented in response to the coronavirus in neighbouring countries. Under the system of permittering, the government temporarily pays a large portion (more than 60%) of the wages of workers who are placed on furlough. Expanded take-up of this scheme, although it will preserve much of the existing labour market for the duration of the pandemic, will leave the government liable for a significant increase in spending.
On the employer side, fiscal support has expanded rapidly. The government has deferred tax payments and purchased corporate bonds on the secondary market, reducing borrowing costs for businesses. About Nkr20bn has been set aside as a crisis fund to cover fixed costs for businesses during the coronavirus pandemic, modelled on the Danish fund set up for this purpose.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy In response to the substantial disruption caused by the pandemic, Norges Bank (the central bank) has lowered the policy rate by 150 basis points since February, to 0%-the lowest rate in modern history. This unprecedented monetary easing was completed over three meetings of the monetary policy committee. The central bank also lowered countercyclical capital buffers for major banks from 2.5% to 1% to ensure bank solvency and expand credit growth.
We expect Norges Bank to maintain its highly accommodative policy until the end of 2021, given the lingering uncertainty around the evolution of the pandemic, which will continue to weigh on business and consumer confidence. There are likely to be substantial scarring effects on both output and employment from the virus, with major risks to Norway's oil sector, with looser monetary policy required to accelerate the recovery in the near term. Looking ahead, Norges Bank targets inflation of "close to 2% over time", and the policy rate should rise steadily after 2021 when economic conditions improve. The steady rise in oil prices, the gradual recovery of the domestic economy and the revival in global trade should all generate a steady normalisation of interest rates over the forecast period.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth Despite the shift in policy towards a steady easing of lockdown restrictions, the gradual pace of withdrawal throughout the second quarter of 2020 will guarantee a contraction in April-June, after an initial decline of 1.6% in the first quarter. With most forms of the lockdown extending from March 12th to June 15th we judge that the bulk of the decline will take place in the second quarter, as 11 of the 14 weeks of restrictions took place in that time. The economy will rebound only in the latter half of 2020 as control measures subside and economic activity improves, bringing full-year output down by 5.5% from 2019. The recent increase in viral infections could generate a reimposition of some social distancing measures, which would curtail the extent of the recovery. We judge that long-term scarring from the crisis will be significant, but modest compared with peer economies, as government support for short-term disruption to the labour market will remain substantial.
The coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent lockdown will primarily affect consumer spending and export demand in Norway, which we expect to decline by 6.9% and 11.8% respectively. On the consumption side, the imposition of social distancing measures damages consumer spending both directly, through the prevention of consumer activities such as services spending, and indirectly, through a decline in total employment and consumer spending power. On the external side, similar lockdowns among major trading partners (namely the UK and Germany) will weigh on demand for major exports, such as energy goods and shipping.
The export-oriented oil and gas sector will be especially damaged by the outbreak. Demand for both gas and oil globally is strongly pro-cyclical and Norway's entrenched exposure to markets in Europe (the region worst hit by the crisis) implies a substantial contraction in real exports this year. Although firms within Norway's oil sector (especially Equinor, the state-backed oil firm) remain far from insolvency, real exports and the outlook for investment in the sector have worsened significantly.
Investment in both the oil and non-oil sectors will also weaken, as uncertainty around a possible recurrence of the virus (at least until a vaccine is produced) will chill investor appetite for risk, and cuts in oil sector production will weigh on the returns of offshore projects. Growth will recover more substantially from 2021 onwards as economic life returns to normal and the risk of a reimposition of controls steadily abates. However, the prospect of lasting damage to household balance sheets (with household debt at 110% of GDP in December 2019), business confidence and oil investment will keep real GDP below pre-crisis levels until 2023.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation The pandemic and consequent lockdown has weighed on consumer prices, with the collapse in energy prices and demand for non-essential goods pulling down price growth. Headline inflation initially fell from 1.8% in January to 0.7% in March. Nevertheless, now that restrictions are being lifted, inflation has started to pick up pace again, rising to 1.4% in July. Rising core inflation, owing to an uptick in food prices, to over 2.6% in July, will erode consumer purchasing power.
Looking ahead, we expect that the disruptive effects of the coronavirus on consumer demand and oil prices will drag down inflation in 2020, to an average of 1.2%. This trend will be supported by an easing in household stockpiling as controls on social distancing abate, and as the fall in oil prices (which we expect to average US$40.5/barrel this year) ripples through the economy. The recent appreciation of the currency should also curtail inflation. A stronger than expected recovery in consumer spending continues to pose upside risks for inflation.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates The krone has largely followed the substantial changes in global energy markets since January. Between end-2019 and end-June, it depreciated by roughly 7.2% on a trade-weighted basis, as the price of oil has collapsed from US$65/b to US$42.8/b and economic activity has slowed.
Although the krone has strengthened from its nadir in March (when it had depreciated by over 17% since December), conditions of subdued demand and slower growth are likely to prevent the krone from fully returning to its December value until 2024, when oil prices have recovered, and production is restored. Further downward shocks to oil prices, chiefly from shocks to global demand, remain a risk to our exchange-rate forecast.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector Norway's current-account surpluses are structurally supported by large inflows on the trade and primary income accounts, respectively reflecting the economy's position as a major oil exporter and the size of the GPFG.
Although inflows in both of these components will be damaged by the economic fallout from the coronavirus, we do not expect either of these accounts to fall into deficit. Oil exports will be damaged by the proposed cuts to production, but we expect that this will be balanced by the reduction in goods imports, keeping the trade balance in surplus despite the fall in oil prices.
As the coronavirus abates, steady rises in oil prices from 2021 onwards will further support the trade balance, and increases in production (barring any government intervention) will continue throughout the forecast period. We expect that this, combined with a revival of growth in major trading partners (particularly Germany), will support a rise in the current-account surplus over the forecast period, to 5.4% of GDP in 2024.

Full text: - The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will retain significant support and tight control over the government until 2024. We expect the BJP-led coalition to gain control of the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of parliament) by end-2020, which will give the administration power to pass legislation unilaterally. The government's Hindu-nationalist agenda will cause social tensions to rise in the longer term. The relationship with China will become more strained during the forecast period, while India will be more aligned with the US on strategic matters.

- The business environment will improve in 2020-24, owing in part to increased political effectiveness as the BJP-led government increases its representation in the upper house, which will enable it to enact legislation unchallenged. An anticipated improvement in the infrastructure category has also helped to push up the overall score. However, improvements elsewhere mean that India's global ranking rises only slightly, from 62nd in the historic period to 58th out of the 82 countries assessed. Among its BRICS peers, India scores better than Russia (5.51) but fares worse than Brazil (6.11), China (5.96) and South Africa (6.04).

- Economic growth in fiscal years 2020/21-2024/25 (April-March) will be below potential, averaging 3.7% per year, owing to significant disruption to business activities and the unabated local spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic in 2020, despite containment measures. The administration will pursue an expansionary fiscal policy in the early part of the forecast period as it attempts to cushion the negative impact of containment measures used to limit the spread of the coronavirus. We expect the budget deficit to narrow from 2021/22 as a gradual revival in economic activity boosts revenue collection, allowing the administration to accord a higher priority to fiscal consolidation. The Indian rupee will face downward pressure over the next five years, owing to the country's current-account deficit from 2021 and relatively high rates of inflation. We expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) to cut interest rates in the remainder of 2020 and to start to tighten monetary policy only in late 2021.

- India's economy will benefit from a growing population, and the labour force will expand by 0.5% a year on average in 2020-24. However, reaping the full benefits of the country's young population will prove immensely difficult amid a shortage of suitable employment opportunities. Large skills gaps will persist owing to inadequacies in the education system. The tertiary education sector will broadly underperform, with the exception of a few pockets of excellence. Underemployment and unemployment will add to social tensions. This will be exacerbated by a wide gender imbalance. Continued migration into towns and cities from the countryside will also add to existing economic and social stresses in urban areas.

- Sustained real GDP growth from 2021/22 will support the outlook for wage growth and assist the expansion of the middle class, even as average national GDP per head remains low, at US$2,606 in 2024. The consumer market will return to growth as the pandemic eases and a vaccine becomes available from end-2021. Growth will be supported by rapidly rising income levels among the huge population of around 1.4bn. We also expect that more households will be able to afford relatively high-value products. The e-commerce sector will expand strongly with higher smartphone and internet penetration.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.

- India's economy will grow substantially, supported by a shift in employment from rural to urban areas. However, income inequality will become more pronounced and lead to heightened social and political tensions. India's growing economy will make it an increasingly influential diplomatic force. Owing to shared strategic geopolitical and economic interests, India will move closer to the US and Japan. The continuing rivalry for influence in South Asia will weigh on ties with China.

Background: India gained independence in 1947 after two centuries of British colonial rule. Partition at the same time created the state of Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars (two of them over the disputed territory of Kashmir). India is the second-most populous country in the world, with an estimated 1.37bn people in 2019, according to the UN. Its economy was the third-largest in the world in 2019 (measured in nominal US dollars at purchasing power parity exchange rates by the World Bank).
Political structure: India has been a democracy since independence. At federal level, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) holds a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), although it governs in a broader coalition, the National Democratic Alliance. India follows the UK model of parliamentary government, with a prime minister as head of government. It has a president as the head of state. The country has a quasi-federal structure, with state governments having their own legislatures and enjoying a fair degree of freedom.
Policy issues: We expect the ruling BJP to undertake policy reforms once the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic passes. The government has already announced measures to privatise or merge public-sector units in many industries to promote competition. The government will also make modest progress on the liberalisation of regulatory requirements and foreign investment. However, the primary focus of the government will be on structural reform, particularly the contentious labour and land laws. We expect only incremental progress on these issues. The current administration has made headway in speeding up infrastructure projects, and this will also remain a priority in the next five years.
Taxation: The government will maintain efforts to broaden the tax base in 2020-24, including by further digitising tax departments. This, coupled with strong economic growth after 2020, will support a pick-up in tax collection. Despite some reforms, including a nationwide goods and services tax in 2017, India's tax system will remain highly complex.
Foreign trade: India's merchandise trade deficit narrowed to US$157.7bn in 2019, from US$186.7bn in 2018, while the surplus on the country's services account rose from US$80.8bn to US$84.2bn in the same period.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance India's constitution came into effect in 1950, underpinning the country's democratic system of governance. The state is technically secular, giving no preference to any of the manifold religious or social groups. India's democracy is well entrenched and elections for the national and state parliaments have been held for decades. The country's two major political parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the dominant component party of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and the Indian National Congress, which governed the country for decades, often in coalition with smaller regional parties. Regional parties are prominent in many state assemblies, enabling them to wield significant influence on national politics through the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of parliament). The BJP holds a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house) and governs with the support of smaller parties in the NDA. The BJP currently falls short of a majority in Rajya Sabha, but we expect it to secure enough seats to attain a majority in this chamber before the end of 2020.
The BJP's ideological approach leans towards Hindu nationalism, mixing social conservatism with a more aggressive foreign and security policy. Its growing dominance of national and state governments has thus challenged India's secular tradition. The party has moved recently to extend its vote base beyond its roots in the urban middle class by adopting more rural-focused policies. Congress has a more centre-left ideological approach to socio-economic issues.

Political outlook: Political stability The BJP won the majority of seats in the election for the Lok Sabha that took place in April-May 2019. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the central government to remain in power for its full term, which ends in 2024. The results of the 2019 election were a testament to the popularity of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, who will remain the dominant figure in the government. Decision-making will remain centralised among the prime minister's office and key ministers.
In late March the government implemented what has been among the most stringent lockdown measures around the world, designed to stem the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19). These measures were initially welcomed by the public as an effective method of containing the virus. However, the unabated spread of the epidemic and the extensive economic damage caused by the restrictions highlight the risk of social unrest. The government's inability to provide large-scale income support will challenge the administration. We expect the government's reform agenda, especially the liberalisation of labour laws, to be another source of tension. However, these developments will not unseat the government; this is because of the formidable support it enjoys from a large part of the citizenry and the lack of a strong opposition.
Over the medium term, protests by religious groups and communal clashes will continue to pose a threat to political stability. Large-scale protests tied to the Citizenship Amendment Act were only cut short by social distancing measures introduced to slow the spread of the virus. In contrast to the country's current secular constitution, several far-right groups, including some affiliated with the BJP, have long been pushing for India to be recast as a Hindu nation-a view that puts them at odds with minority groups in the country, notably Muslims. The risk of social instability is high in the latter part of the forecast period, particularly in the two-year period prior to the 2024 general election, if the ruling party moves ahead with its Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) agenda.
The security situation in the centrally administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) will remain a central concern throughout the forecast period. We expect security risks in the area to remain high. Any attempt by protesters to destabilise the region is likely to face a heavy-handed response from the government, including the use of internet shutdowns, curfews and riot-control forces. The government's move has also increased the risk of terrorist attack by separatist forces in major Indian cities such as Delhi and Mumbai. A deadly border clash with Chinese troops in June 2020 will also affect political stability. Vocal domestic demands for a strong response pose political risks for Mr Modi, who will be reluctant to risk military escalation.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness The outlook for political and institutional effectiveness in 2020-24 is mixed. The BJP dominates the political landscape at national and-increasingly-state level. Some members of state legislative assemblies have defected to the BJP. The party has full control of the lower house, and its re-election in 2019 will help to bolster policy effectiveness. It will soon attain a simple majority in the Rajya Sabha, after which it will be able to pass legislation without approval from the opposition. This will ease the passage of laws in parliament, although we believe that the BJP's growing dominance will also result in greater levels of corruption within the party.
Support for the BJP and Mr Modi has been relatively high in 2020, as the government acted swiftly to implement a lockdown to limit the spread of the coronavirus. However, that support might weaken as the toll exacted on the economy by the measures becomes more pronounced. However, the administration will actively pursue its Hindu nationalism agenda to woo supporters. Since we do not believe the BJP can go too far in pushing forward labour law and land acquisition reform, we expect it to win a few more state elections within the forecast period, which will help it to consolidate its power.
The BJP has been an advocate of so-called competitive federalism, which encourages competition between India's states. We believe that this approach will lead to a notable improvement in political and institutional effectiveness in reform-oriented states, particularly in the south and the west. However, it is also likely to deepen economic disparities between India's more economically successful states and its laggards, increasing social friction, competition for fiscal resources and pressure for migration between regions.
The BJP's dominance of national and state politics will have a corrosive impact on institutional checks and balances within India during 2020-24. There have already been signs that the government has successfully pressured media groups to rein in critical coverage. The independence of the Reserve Bank of India (the central bank) has also been eroded. There remains a significant risk that the government will engage in a major confrontation with the judiciary at some point in the next five years, particularly if judges overturn a key policy decision, such as the move to revoke the special status of J&K in 2019. Judicial challenges to the government's policies towards minority religions could also be a point of friction.
Political outlook: Election watch The next general election is expected to be held around May 2024. The focus before then will be the state assembly elections. The results of the previous state elections suggest that voters treat state and national elections differently, and that local issues tend to be more important in the former. We expect the BJP coalition to gain control of the state assembly in the upcoming Bihar election, to be held in October-November 2020, but only with the help of its coalition partner in the state.
In the Rajya Sabha, the BJP and its allies form the largest grouping, although they command fewer than half of the seats. Nevertheless, we expect the BJP-led NDA to win control of a majority in the upper house by the end of 2020 after elections in key seats in November. This will enable the alliance to pass legislation without opposition approval. However, it will struggle to win the two-thirds majority needed to make constitutional changes unchallenged.
Political outlook: International relations Tensions with Pakistan have persisted amid the dispute over J&K. We expect relations to remain strained, but do not anticipate a complete breakdown of diplomatic ties. We believe that Pakistan's military will increase its support for militant groups in Indian-controlled Kashmir. This will raise the risk of terrorist attacks by non-state actors. Although small-scale military exchanges between the two countries are likely to occur in 2020-24, the nuclear arsenal of the two countries will act as a powerful deterrent against full-scale conflict.
A deadly border clash between China and India in June has led to a substantial deterioration of bilateral relations. India has taken steps to retaliate economically against China, such as toughening the approval process for Chinese investments and increasing non-tariff barriers on Chinese exports to India. Economic retaliation by China will focus primarily on tit-for-tat tariff increases, rather than more detrimental export restrictions that could disrupt supply chains for Indian firms. We also expect further skirmishes tied to infrastructure development in border regions disputed by the two countries. However, large-scale military clashes are not within our core forecast.
Souring ties with China will encourage India to improve relations with the US, Japan and Australia, among other countries. India's foreign policy within South Asia will also focus on countering increasing Chinese influence in Nepal and Sri Lanka. India's relations with Bangladesh will remain cordial.

India's overall score in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings rises to 5.74 in 2020-24, from 5.25 in 2015-19. However, improvements elsewhere mean that its global ranking rises only slightly to 58th out of the 82 countries assessed, from 62nd in the historic period. Among its BRICS peers, India scores better than Russia (5.51) but fares worse than Brazil (6.11), China (5.96) and South Africa (6.04). India's score is dragged down by weak ratings for policy towards private enterprises & competition and the labour market.
The huge opportunities presented by India's enormous population and rapidly growing economy contribute to a strong (albeit declining) score for market opportunities: indeed, India ranks eighth in the world in this category in our forecast period (2020-24), up from 12th in the historical period. We expect infrastructure to improve markedly in 2020-24. The country will also score relatively well in terms of technological readiness, largely reflecting its well-developed internet and telecommunications sectors. Political effectiveness will be bolstered when the coalition led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) coalition secures a majority in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house) before the end of 2020, improving the political environment. Still, despite the improvement the score for political effectiveness will remain poor, at just 4.2.
Infrastructure will register the largest gains We see the score for foreign trade and exchange controls improving in 2020-24 as the government looks to support India's development as a centre for export manufacturing. However, in the areas of financing, taxes and foreign trade & exchange controls India will remain a global laggard. While the country will still draw inward investment seeking to tap its huge market opportunities, the difficult business operating environment (for both foreign and local firms) will serve as a drag on productivity, holding back the economy's potential.

Business environment outlook: India's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: The government takes steps towards partial privatisation of some state-owned companies in 2021.
2022-24: The government continues to rationalise liquidation and bankruptcy laws to simplify the closure of loss-making businesses or merger-and-acquisition activity involving other corporate entities.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: The government's policy towards foreign direct investment (FDI) will remain ambiguous. Some companies face a lengthy approval process
2022-24: Foreign investment in export manufacturing increases markedly, albeit in only a few regions. Strong growth in e-commerce and the expanding Reliance Jio telecommunications platform will attract FDI from leading internet firms.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: The country remains reluctant to join major regional trade deals. However, the government seeks to hold talks with members of the OECD to strengthen trade links.
2022-24: Full capital-account convertibility remains off the policy agenda.
Taxes 2020-21: Rationalisation of the goods and services tax (GST) continues, resulting in a reduction in the number of tax bands. Tax breaks and rebates are made available to businesses and individuals affected by the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak.
2022-24: Alcohol and petroleum products remain outside the scope of the GST.
Financing 2020-21: The Reserve Bank of India (the central bank) relaxes regulatory norms for debt-laden banks and non-bank financial companies, raising risks to banking-sector stability but improving the availability of funding for corporates.
2022-24: Private-sector banks account for a rising share of total lending, while bad debt issues persist in public-sector banks. Major consolidation and privatisations among the public-sector banks will continue.
The labour market 2020-21: Unemployment soars in the wake of a nationwide lockdown and the retention of restrictions in various states. Use of the rural employment guarantee scheme increases.
2022-24: Some labour reforms make headway at state level. However, reforms at the central government level remain stuck, owing to a lack of political consensus in support of the changes.
Infrastructure 2020-21: The government increases its budgetary allocation for the expansion of healthcare facilities in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
2022-24: As some projects near completion, India's infrastructure improves in terms of broadband connection speed, distribution, road and rail networks, ports and transport infrastructure, as well as electricity and office space supply.
Technological readiness 2020-21: Most technological innovation continues to be concentrated in a few clusters, such as Bangalore. Expenditure on research and development as a proportion of GDP remains low by Asian standards.
2022-24: The government makes efforts to digitise the delivery of public services, in an effort to cut corruption and promote the efficiency of "last-mile delivery". In this context, the Aadhar biometrics platform boosts government service delivery.

Twin deficits on the current and fiscal accounts will persist in 2021-24 India's score for the macroeconomic environment falls to 6.1 in 2020-24, from 6.6 in 2015-19, on account of a substantial contraction forecast for real GDP in fiscal year 2020/21 (April-March). The imposition of a nationwide lockdown between March 24th and June 8th and the maintenance of restrictions in a number of states will cause the economy to contract at its fastest rate on record in the current fiscal year. However, the country's global ranking for 2020-24 has risen from 54th to 47th; although we expect the economy to contract in 2020/21, we still expect it to be among the fastest-growing economies in the world over the remainder of the forecast period. Twin deficits on the fiscal and current accounts beyond 2021 will remain one of the weakest aspects of the macroeconomic environment. We forecast the current-account deficit to persist after 2021 and to widen over the forecast period owing to a persistent goods trade deficit. Fiscal pressure will be stronger, despite rising tax collection from 2021, as the government outspends its receipts to fund burgeoning development projects. The coronavirus (Covid-19) will force the government to consolidate public finances only gradually, and the fiscal deficit will remain at an elevated level during the forecast period. The erosion of the independence of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) in recent years will weaken the management of monetary policy. Consumer price inflation will pick up as consumer demand and global oil prices recover.

The score for policy towards private enterprise and competition improves to 5 in 2020-24, from 4.5 in 2015-19, largely owing to efforts to privatise state-owned enterprises, which will reduce the distorting impact of the state sector on the economy, and improvements in the protection of intellectual property (IP). However, owing to progress elsewhere, this improvement in the score has only a modest impact on India's global rankings in this category. The government has made progress on streamlining the bureaucracy and merging some ministries, easing the approval process for industrial and infrastructure projects. It has also encouraged competition between states by devolving power to them to experiment locally with pro-business liberalisation in special economic zones. According to a statement made in parliament in March 2020 by the commerce minister, Piyush Goyal, the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Haryana, Jharkhand and Gujarat have the highest ranking in terms of the ease of doing business within India. Despite these state-level measures, however, the scope for improvement remains immense and more reforms will come within the forecast period.

- The government has gradually raised targets for disinvestment (a term that includes privatisation receipts) and seeks to raise Rs2.1trn (US$28bn) in 2020/21. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) administration has habitually fallen short of its disinvestment targets, and delays to planned sales will continue amid opposition from unions and other vested interests. Nevertheless, we expect the government to achieve substantial levels of privatisation in 2020-24, including the sale of loss-making entities such as Air India and a telecommunications firm, MTNL. The successful privatisation of the Life Insurance Corporation of India in the forecast period would signal a strong commitment to privatisation, as this long-mooted move has been opposed vehemently by employees.
- The government's drive to expand the use of public-private partnerships, notably in rail and digital communications infrastructure projects, will create opportunities for private firms in the next five years. However, there is a substantial risk that firms will experience problems in correctly pricing bids for such projects, which may render many unprofitable.
- We expect the protection of IP in India to improve over the next five years. This will reflect pressure from domestic companies to toughen enforcement as local levels of investment in research and development (R&D) increase. The regime is nonetheless likely to remain patchy, with courts in more developed parts of the country offering better levels of protection than those in poorer regions. Reform and strengthening of the Intellectual Property Appeal Board would provide further impetus for improved protection of IP rights.

Regulatory changes will make India a more attractive destination for FDI India's score for policy towards foreign investment improves to 6 in 2020-24, from 5.5 in 2020-24. The improvement is driven by friendlier government policy towards foreign capital. This enables India's global ranking to rise from 63rd to 56th, even as other countries have also made headway in their efforts to attract foreign investors. The NDA government, led by the BJP, has pursued gradual liberalisation of the foreign-investment regime in recent years. The administration reinforced its commitment in the budget for 2020/21, particularly in the energy and infrastructure sectors. Nevertheless, some important sectors of the economy, such as multi-brand retail and banking, will remain subject to foreign investment caps. Discrimination and restrictions against investment from China will be extended in the next few years, as India strives to shield the domestic market from Chinese influence, owing to strategic competition in the region. Levels of foreign direct investment (FDI) in India averaged US$44.2bn a year between 2015-19, but will decline to US$40.4bn on average in 2020-24 as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic hurts investor sentiment and reduces willingness to commit to large investments abroad.

- The government will seek to give added impetus to its "Make in India" campaign and the "self-reliant India" package, which seeks to boost local manufacturing during 2020-24. Notably, it will offer added tax incentives to major foreign investments in advanced production fields such as semiconductors, solar cells, lithium batteries and servers. India will attract some manufacturers, particularly as international firms shift some production out of China amid growing concerns over rising labour costs and trade conflicts. Moreover, the impact of these initiatives on the economy will remain limited, owing in part to continued problems with the business environment in areas such as land acquisition.
- The 2020/21 budget underscored the government's commitment to attract foreign capital and expertise to strengthen the ailing domestic power sector. By reducing the corporate tax rate for power-generation firms to 15%, the government raised the possibility of greater participation by foreign firms in this critical sector in the future.
- E-commerce rules that came into effect in February 2019 generated opposition from foreign investors in the sector. The rules notably bar companies from selling products via firms in which they have an equity interest and from establishing special arrangements with suppliers to sell exclusively on their sites. A news agency, Reuters, reported in mid-2019 that a US retail giant, Walmart, had argued that the rules discriminate between large foreign e-commerce companies and their domestic counterparts. The issue is likely to be a point of discussion between negotiators seeking to resolve India-US trade tensions. Given the evolving state of e-commerce legislation in India, the rules are likely to be tweaked in 2020-24 in a way that addresses some of the complaints of foreign investors.

India's large online market will attract considerable FDI
- We expect the broader online market to attract a considerable amount of FDI over the forecast period as US and European firms vie to establish a presence. The Reliance Jio platform, the country's largest online platform, with more than 400m subscribers, will prove particularly attractive for foreign firms by offering a simpler way to operate in the Indian online technology market. For instance, local media reported in July 2020 that Google (US) would invest US$4.5bn for a 7.7% stake in the platform. Additional investments from other US-based firms (such as Facebook) indicate that foreign investors are willing to deploy capital in India, given the size of the domestic market. Chinese investors used to participate actively in Indian internet start-ups. However, ongoing bilateral tensions between China and India will significantly reduce the former's presence, which will leave a gap in funding for many start-ups.

The score for foreign trade and exchange controls improves significantly to 6.4 in the forecast period, from 5.1 in 2015-19, resulting in an improvement in India's global and regional rankings in this category. This progress is due to significant improvements in trade-related bureaucracy and modest deregulation of capital-account restrictions. In recent years the government has lowered an array of export subsidies and harmonised them under two general schemes-one for goods and one for services. It has also invested in improved infrastructure; reduced costs through greater use of online and mobile platforms; permitted the electronic submission of documents with digital signatures; and allowed exporters to self-seal their containers using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. These measures have formed part of a broader effort to stimulate exports through supply-side reforms that are intended to boost the competitiveness of Indian exporters.

- Negotiations between India and the EU on a proposed free-trade agreement (FTA) have been stalled since 2013 owing to disagreement on a few contentious issues; the deal is unlikely to be revived in the forecast period. In June 2020 India and the EU held talks with the aim of restarting negotiations, but the sides remain too far apart on a deal. In November 2019 India withdrew from talks on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a proposed FTA between ASEAN's ten member states and the six countries with which the bloc already has FTAs in place.

India will seek trade ties with OECD countries, but progress will be limited
- The NDA government will adjust its overall trade strategy amid a slowdown in global commerce in 2020. We expect the administration to initiate negotiations on FTAs with some advanced economies, such as the UK and Australia, but none of these agreements will be finalised within our forecast period. Trade relations with the US will remain strained, and we expect India to remain out of the US Generalised System of Preferences for an extended period. A more limited trade deal focusing on sectors of key strategic interest, such as steel for India, seems a more likely outcome from talks with the US.

India's score for taxes rises to 5.9 in 2020-24, from 4.5 in 2015-19. As a result, the country's global and regional rankings improve considerably. This is driven by improvements in the corporate tax burden and the consistency and fairness of the tax system, as well as reduced complexity. The nationwide goods and services tax (GST) introduced in July 2017 was one of India's biggest tax reforms in decades. It replaced a slew of indirect central and state taxes and marks a significant step towards the creation of a single national market. Since the roll-out of the tax, the GST Council has met regularly and taken measures to simplify the tax and cut its rates. (The GST Council comprises a group of ministers authorised with deciding changes to the rate and structure of the tax.) Several landmark tax disputes between the Indian authorities and major foreign investors have arisen in recent years, involving claims of expropriation and retrospective changes of tax regulation. Some have been resolved (a major case with a Finnish technology company, Nokia, was settled in 2018), but several cases remain in the courts and continue to cast a cloud over the country's reputation as an investment destination.
As fiscal consolidation comes into focus, the tax net will be widened
- We expect tax revenue to decline in 2020/21, owing to the impact of the coronavirus on economic activity and corporate profits. We anticipate that the government will announce a range of tax relief measures to bolster growth and reduce pressure on corporate cash flows. In the latter half of the forecast period, however, there will be growing impetus to widen the tax net to reduce the large fiscal deficit, by means such as increasing the capacity of the tax authorities.
- As collections from the GST tax pick up, the government will continue to rationalise GST rates and to bring more items into lower tax brackets, although multiple tax slabs will remain in place. Several key items, including alcoholic spirits and petroleum products, will remain outside the GST net.
- Despite noticeable improvements, foreign investors will remain wary of the government's opaque tax regime, highlighted by the risk of retrospective changes to tax laws. Public concerns over tax evasion have led the government to increase the regulatory power of tax authorities, raising concerns over possible overreach in a country where tax laws remain complex.

The score for financing improves from 5.1 in 2015-19 to 5.5 in 2020-24 as the quality of the financial regulatory system strengthens. However, India's position in the global rankings deteriorates from 57th to 62nd as other countries make greater progress in this area. A number of massive bank fraud cases have emerged in recent years, including an alleged US$1.4bn fraud at Punjab National Bank. The bad debts associated with these (and other pre-existing problems in the banking sector) will continue to weigh on the health and resilience of the banking system. In the most recent edition of its twice-yearly Financial Stability Report, published in June 2020, the RBI indicated that it expects the non-performing loan ratio in the banking sector to rise to 12.5% in March 2021, from 8.5% a year earlier (under its baseline scenario). Unfortunately, as bank lending has slowed in recent years, companies have turned to non-bank financial companies for credit, and problems in this segment have further weakened the resilience of the financial system considerably.

- We expect financial regulation in India to improve throughout the forecast period. However, the insolvency law will probably be amended: as court cases involving the insolvency law are decided, they will set precedents that could underline the effectiveness of the law. Better bad-loan provisioning and stricter regulation will support an improvement in the sector's health towards the latter part of our forecast period, improving the availability of financing.

Weakly capitalised banks will weigh on private-sector credit growth
- Public-sector lenders will continue to account for the bulk of total lending, especially in rural areas. The capacity of state-owned banks to increase lending has been held back in recent years as they sought to address balance-sheet weaknesses. In the 2019/20 budget the government announced plans for a Rs700bn (US$9.3bn) capital injection into public banks. In the absence of the coronavirus, this would have helped to reinvigorate their lending over 2020-24. However, the economic slowdown has weakened corporate balance sheets, and this will impair their repayment capability. We believe that amid deterioration in asset quality, further recapitalisation will be necessary. This will prove politically and fiscally challenging, weighing on the ability of banks to fund private sector credit growth. It should be noted that marked improvements in lending practices would be unlikely even if banks were fully recapitalised.
- Priority-sector lending (minimum mandated lending to specific sectors aimed at achieving socio-developmental objectives) will remain a feature of government policy throughout the forecast period. The RBI will continue to push both state-owned and private banks to meet priority-sector targets. Indian commercial banks and foreign lenders with more than 20 branches in the country are currently required to provide 40% of their net bank credit to the priority sectors, which include agriculture, housing and renewable energy. A significant reduction in this target is unlikely in 2020-24.

India's score for the labour market remains unchanged at 5 in the forecast period. Moreover, the country is now the worst performer in Asia on this metric. Our core forecast is that progress on the liberalisation of contentious labour and land laws will be limited and the benefits will only be seen in the latter part of the forecast period. Under the previous NDA administration India took some limited steps towards overhauling its outdated array of labour laws (many of which have not been comprehensively revamped in decades). For example, it moved to allow all industrial establishments to hire workers on fixed-term contracts, which was previously permissible only in the textile industry. Several BJP-governed states, including Gujarat, have temporarily suspended the strict labour code to facilitate economic recovery. We expect this trend to continue broadly in 2020-24, but progress will be inhibited by opposition from trade unions (including those affiliated with the ruling coalition).

- A major reason for the slow progress on labour law reform is the government's lack of a majority in the Rajya Sabha. We expect the NDA to obtain a majority in the upper house from the end of 2020, which should speed up the legislation process.

The Code of Industrial Relations will not be passed easily
- The government has prepared a Code of Industrial Relations, representing the consolidation of more than 40 different labour laws under four major codes covering wages, industrial relations, social security and occupational safety, health and working conditions. Parliament passed the first code, on wages, in July 2019. This includes clauses that allow the government to set national minimum wage rates for various regions and industries. We believe that given the context of the coronavirus, as well as strong resistance from opposition parties and trade unions, passage of these changes will not be swift in 2020-24.

Progress in overhauling labour laws will be driven by states
- Although the central government is harmonising and simplifying many labour regulations at national level, the states will still retain considerable autonomy to advance their own reforms in this field. For example, in response to the economic slowdown triggered by the coronavirus in mid-2020, several states-including Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh-temporarily suspended some federal and state-level labour laws. This included the suspension of provisions relating to daily working hours (which have risen from eight to twelve hours), trade unions and industrial disputes. While these changes may remove some obstacles to investment (particularly in labour-intensive manufacturing), the suspension of large parts of labour regulation increases risks to workers' rights and could erode working conditions.
- The BJP government has vowed to improve workforce education in order to provide the labour force with the skills necessary to supply talent to emerging sectors such as artificial intelligence, 3D printing, robotics, virtual reality, the internet of things and big data. We do not believe that these commitments will result in much change on the ground in 2020-24, and the shortage of workers with suitable skills will remain a problem for many industries.

The score for infrastructure improves from 3.8 in 2015-19 to 5.8 in 2020-24. This is driven by higher scores for broadband connection speed, distribution, road and rail networks, ports and transport infrastructure, electricity and office space supply. These gains will result in a marked improvement in India's global ranking to 52nd in the forecast period, from 73rd in 2015-19. Infrastructure improvements and expansion remain key priorities for the NDA government. We expect the bulk of public investment to be diverted to transport, energy and urban improvement projects. However, the pace of progress on projects that are already under way will remain constrained by weak government effectiveness and delays in regulatory clearances (particularly environmental approvals).

- The finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, announced in February 2020 that the budget would allocate financial support to build an additional 100 airports for 1bn travellers by 2024. While delays in their construction are likely, we expect that these airports, once finished, will improve regional connectivity and bolster domestic labour flows between states.
- India will make considerable improvements in enhancing internet speed as well as connectivity. According to the International Telecommunication Union, the proportion of internet subscribers in India has increased steadily to 54.3% in 2019, from 21.4% in 2014. However, the aggregate figure conceals a wide disparity in internet penetration rate by income group, with poorer households or those in remote areas at risk of falling behind.
- Progress on urban civic infrastructure projects, such as water supply, will be hindered by inadequate private-sector involvement. The limited returns on investment in these sectors mean that official efforts to draw in more private-sector participation will struggle. The private sector will focus instead on areas that promise faster returns, such as airport construction, and there will be significant progress in these areas in 2020-24. However, demand for infrastructure will continue to exceed supply by a significant margin in the forecast period, placing stress on already scarce resources.
- Two publicly funded connectivity projects, Bharatmala (road construction) and Sagarmala (port construction), will continue to be prioritised throughout the forecast period. The first phase of Bharatmala is aimed at connecting 550 of the country's districts through the national highways network, from only 300 in 2017. The government plans to build a total of 24,800 km of roads by 2022. However, progress on this project will be hindered by limited financial resources, and it is likely to miss its targets.
- The quality and breadth of railway services will remain a challenge in 2020-24. India has a large rail network but its quality is inadequate, with frequent accidents and poor speeds that restrain efficiency. A lack of capital investment in the sector constrains the expansion of capacity. Despite piecemeal efforts, the overall quality of the rail network will remain poor in comparison with other territories with large rail networks, such as China and Europe. However, projects including a "bullet train" connecting Ahmedabad with Mumbai and several ongoing urban mass rapid transit projects will make progress during the forecast period.

India scores respectably for technological readiness, improving slightly to 6.1 in the forecast period, from 5.8 in 2015-19, on account of higher internet use. Still, improvements elsewhere mean that its global ranking falls slightly from 45th to 47th. The country boasts a relatively advanced R&D infrastructure, partly owing to the fact that the education system has historically been skewed towards higher educational outcomes. This has facilitated the development of relatively research-intensive sectors such as pharmaceuticals and technology. India has also been an enthusiastic adopter of e-government systems, seeking to improve the effectiveness of public service delivery and reduce corruption. Its Aadhar biometric identity cards are helping to enable this process. Nevertheless, high levels of poverty mean that mobile and internet penetration rates in India are still low compared with global and Asian norms.
Internet speeds are set to quicken as 5G services are rolled out
- India lags behind in terms of fixed broadband and mobile internet speed. According to the Speedtest Global Index, India ranked 75th out of 170 countries in June 2020 for fixed broadband connectivity speed. Its ranking on mobile internet speed was even worse, coming in 129th out of 138 countries. We expect that the launch of 5G networks will contribute to higher internet speeds in urban areas in the latter half of the forecast period. In 2018 the Telecom Commission, a government agency, approved the new National Digital Communication Policy, the objectives of which include providing minimum download speeds of 50 Mbps and enabling 10-Gbps connectivity to all rural regions by 2022. The policy also aims to generate 4m jobs in digital communication and to increase the sector's contribution to India's GDP from around 6% at present to 8% by 2022. However, acquiring spectrum licences and laying the requisite fibre network will create obstacles, and the government is likely to fall short of its targets.

E-commerce is focal point of India's digital revolution
- E-commerce has become the focal point of India's digital revolution, owing to factors such as FDI-friendly regulation, a growing middle class, the availability of relatively cheap mobile connections and skilled labour to develop indigenous technology platforms. According to GlobalData, a data analytics firm, the Indian e-commerce market will grow by an average of 20% a year between 2019 and 2023 to a value of US$93bn. Restrictions on the movement of the population during the pandemic are likely to hasten the uptake of e-commerce, particularly in retail. The development of online commerce will be facilitated by the government's Bharat-Net programme, which seeks to provide internet connectivity to every village in the country.
- India will leverage the technological ecosystem provided by Aadhar biometric identity cards in 2020-24. Aadhar provides residents with a unique identification number through a link with their biometric data. We expect that the system will allow both the government and the private sector to deliver official services, such as transfer of benefits, more efficiently. However, it is also likely to face public scrutiny, amid privacy concerns.

Economic forecast: Policy trends The government's majority in the lower house will give it flexibility in determining the economic policy agenda. Its key near-term priority is to contain the coronavirus outbreak, to which India is particularly vulnerable, given its large population and weak healthcare infrastructure. The widespread and stringent lockdown measures imposed from March were only partially successful in reducing the spread of the virus, which has accelerated since such measures were relaxed gradually from May. Despite the spread of the virus, we do not expect the government to re-introduce a nationwide lockdown. Nevertheless, sporadic local lockdown measures in states and cities will be adopted in the coming months to ease pressure on the healthcare system in those areas.
We expect the government to take up policy reforms after the crisis as it looks to support growth. The government plans to open up more sectors of the economy to private firms, by privatising or reducing the number of public-sector units. The administration will undertake piecemeal changes to legislation, such as a relaxation of regulatory requirements and a modest liberalisation of foreign direct investment (FDI) rules. In terms of improving the business environment, one area of attention will be the liberalisation of contentious labour and land laws. Progress on this will be limited and the benefits will only be seen in the latter part of the forecast period.
The lockdown will amplify the mounting non-performing loan (NPL) issue in the banking sector. Slow progress will be made towards policy changes to improve the health of the sector. Infrastructure projects-particularly pet projects of the Modi government, such as the National Infrastructure Pipeline-remain a priority, in response to the rapid pace of urbanisation and to boost the business environment. However, we expect a revival in infrastructure spending only from the fourth quarter of 2020, once the coronavirus outbreak is brought under greater control.

Economic forecast: Fiscal policy Fiscal indicators
(% of GDP: fiscal years beginning Apr 1st of year indicated)
  2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024
Government expenditure 13.4 16.0 15.2 14.8 15.1 14.4
Government revenue 8.8 8.2 8.6 9.5 9.7 9.8
Budget balance -4.6 -7.8 -6.7 -5.4 -5.4 -4.6
Government debt 46.8 56.3 57.7 58.8 57.0 55.0
The coronavirus outbreak will force the government to rewrite its approved budget for 2020/21, which is currently conservatively expansionary. It will temporarily suspend the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act to allow for more flexibility in supporting the economy. The lockdown has prompted an unbudgeted increase in social spending programmes, especially the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, as well as an extension of existing financial support schemes for businesses.
The government announced an Rs20trn package (equivalent to around 10% of GDP) to support the economy in May. However, this headline figure includes liquidity measures provided by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) and advances by banks under the government's measures. The actual amount of additional budgetary spending announced equates to around 1.4% of GDP. We expect the government to announce another fiscal package, worth 1-1.5% of GDP, towards the end of the third quarter of 2020, including an infrastructure development programme. In view of a fall in revenue and lower nominal GDP, the budget deficit is forecast to widen to the equivalent of 7.8% of GDP in 2020/21.
As the economy recovers, the government will look gradually to consolidate the public finances. This will narrow the budget deficit to the equivalent of 6.7% of GDP in 2021/22. The authorities will look to deepen the tax base and increase (currently low) levels of tax compliance. However, the need to support welfare payments and infrastructure spending will maintain upward pressure on fiscal expenditure. We also expect subsidies to remain in place for labour-intensive, small-scale businesses-particularly those that are export-focused. This federal fiscal picture does not reflect the true level of the deficit. The deficits of many states and part of the expenditure of public-sector units represent implicit liabilities for the central government.
Economic forecast: Monetary policy Interest rates
(%)
  2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024
Commercial banks' prime rate (av) 9.5 8.7 8.0 8.4 8.9 9.0
Short-term interest rate (year-end) 7.2 5.9 5.1 5.5 6.0 6.1
Long-term interest rate (year-end) 7.0 5.9 5.1 6.2 6.5 6.6
The coronavirus epidemic will prompt further monetary-policy loosening by the RBI. The central bank has lowered its policy repo rate by 115 basis points, to 4% since March, while also widening the monetary-policy corridor by lowering the reverse repo rate (the "floor" of the corridor) by 155 basis points, to 3.35%. With inflationary pressure expected to moderate and economic growth under strong downward pressure, we expect a further 75-basis-point reduction in the policy repo rate over the remainder of 2020. We also expect the adoption of unconventional policy instruments, including long-term repo operations to lend to banks, which will include further long-term refinancing operations.
Monetary policy will aim to support businesses as the coronavirus pandemic suppresses household spending and business investment. However, the outcome may be far from satisfactory, as monetary-policy transmission is not smooth. While banking-sector lending to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) will improve, as the government has provided a sovereign guarantee for those loans, banks will be reluctant to lend to other parts of the economy, given increased risk. The level of non-performing assets in the financial sector is alarming, and the coronavirus outbreak will only exacerbate the issue, with more firms forced out of business. Policy support from the central bank and the government will be needed to support the recovery of the banking sector, once the pandemic passes.
The RBI has maintained inflation-targeting as the cornerstone of its monetary policy framework. It seeks to contain consumer price inflation within a 2-6% range, and close to a target of 4%. However, strong political pressure on the RBI-which has forced out two hawkish heads of the bank under BJP rule-has complicated the achievement of these objectives.

Economic forecast: Economic growth The impact of the coronavirus: global and regional assumptions The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecasts are built on a series of epidemiological assumptions about the novel coronavirus (Covid-19). Without rapid access to a vaccine, we expect that the disease will eventually infect up to 30% of the world's population; of the symptomatic cases, we assume that about 15% will be severe and up to 1% will prove fatal. Death ratios will depend on a country's ability to detect, track and contain the virus, and the capacity of the national health system. Governments are gradually lifting restrictions on freedom of movement in countries where the number of cases is falling. Some countries may be forced to re-impose measures if cases spike again. Based on previous viral outbreaks and the progress made on other coronavirus vaccines (such as that for severe acute respiratory syndrome-SARS), we expect a vaccine to be available by end-2021.
We forecast that global real GDP will contract by 5%, year on year, in 2020. We believe that trade disruptions will remain severe and forecast that global trade will contract by 22.6% this year. We assume that oil prices will decline by about 37% this year, to average US$40.5/barrel, before they recover to US$45/b next year. Real GDP will contract in all regions this year, but the drop in output will be especially severe in OECD countries, at 6.3%. All G7 countries and all but two G20 countries (China and Indonesia) will experience a full-year recession, and the US's output will contract by 5.3%, while China will record real GDP growth of 1.4%. Asian countries will recover the fastest, with some (including India and South Korea) returning to pre-coronavirus GDP levels in 2021. Of the G7 countries, Germany's output will also be back to 2019 levels in 2021, but others will recover more slowly, with GDP returning to 2019 levels in either 2022 (Canada, France and the US), 2023 (the UK) or 2024 (Italy and Japan). Most countries have responded with fiscal programmes to support businesses and households, raising the risk of sovereign debt crises in the medium term. Central banks have cut interest rates and, more importantly, have stepped up as buyers of last resort for government and corporate debt.
Asia and Australasia will experience a recession in 2020 for the first time since 1998, with regional real GDP forecast to contract by 1.8%. All countries in the region will see their economic performances affected by demand slumps caused by lockdowns within their own borders and those introduced in other countries. Among the region's major economies, India is forecast to experience the steepest economic contraction, at 8.5% for 2020/21, followed by Singapore, Thailand and Japan. Some trade-dependent economies, such as South Korea and Taiwan, will evince a degree of economic resilience because their early response to the pandemic allowed them to avoid costly nationwide lockdowns. Parts of Asia are still expected to post GDP growth in 2020, although at a much less rapid rate than normal. Vietnam will grow by 3.3% this year, while China is forecast to expand by 1.4%, despite a steep economic contraction in January-March. While the pace of recovery will be sequentially weak in Asia in 2021, with many countries still forced to implement localised (if not national) lockdowns, a low base of comparison will help ensure real GDP rebounds to growth of 5.5% that year.
The political and geopolitical effects of the crisis will be significant. The pandemic has resulted in an extraordinary expansion of executive powers, with limited parliamentary oversight. Elections have been cancelled or delayed in some countries. When the pandemic has passed, governments' handling of the response will undergo scrutiny. Failure to address the humanitarian crisis triggered by the coronavirus could further erode trust in national institutions. A severe global economic crisis, followed by large-scale unemployment, could fuel a new wave of popular protests. The crisis may encourage support for the nation state, and a backlash against globalisation and open borders. It will also intensify the competition for global leadership between China and the US, and a realignment of geopolitical spheres of influence may ensue in Europe, Africa and other regions.
The Indian government closed the country's borders to international visitors on March 12th, in a bid to stop imported cases. Domestically, following a Janata ("people's curfew") on March 22nd, the administration declared a formal 21-day lockdown on March 25th, which stopped all non-essential services from operating. As the number of cases continued to rise, the government extended the lockdown to May 31st, with relaxation permitted before this date if certain epidemiological standards were met. The government eased movement restrictions between states on July 1st. The economic impact of the stringent containment measures has been severe, but the pandemic has still spread. The healthcare system in India suffers from a chronic shortage of beds and personnel, making it extremely vulnerable to the pandemic. We expect the government to seek a regional containment strategy to cope with a sudden rise in cases, and to try to cushion the economic impact through various relief packages.

We expect real GDP to contract by 8.5% in 2020/21-the sharpest contraction in economic activity since India's independence in 1947. The headline GDP number will be pulled down primarily by a 21.1% year-on-year contraction in April-June (the first quarter) of 2020/21, reflecting the impact of India's stringent lockdown measures. The economy will continue to contract in the second and third quarters, by 8.4% and 4.1%, respectively, as the administration is unable to control the spread of the virus and intermittent local lockdown measures are put in place. We do not expect the economy to register growth on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of 2020/21, as job losses, business closures and social distancing measures depress activity. Sectors such as travel, hospitality and tourism will be the most affected.
On a GDP expenditure basis, we expect private consumption to contract sharply in 2020/21, as people's economic activities are constrained during lockdown and as consumption remains low, even after the restrictions are lifted. Investment spending is also expected to decline steeply, as firms postpone activity amid high uncertainty around the virus. We also expect increased loan liabilities to be taken up by corporates and banks to further discourage new investment. We maintain our view that the government will continue to bolster the economy through increased expenditure, but the effect will be limited. We expect exports to fall as a global recession sets in.
Real GDP growth is expected to rebound sharply in 2021/22, but the headline forecast of 9.1% is exaggerated by an extremely low base of comparison in 2020/21. Economic growth will remain weak on a quarter-on-quarter basis, because of increased bankruptcies and as fiscal support is pared back. Economic growth in 2022/23-2024/25 will average 5.9% a year. Incremental progress on structural reform will provide support for growth in the latter part of the forecast period.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends In 2020 the rural economy will recover more quickly than its urban counterpart, which helps the share of agriculture in GDP to grow. However, as the economy moves up the value chain and productivity improves, the share of agriculture in total output will continue to decline gradually; we expect it to fall from 20% in 2020/21 to 17.6% by 2024/25. The primary sector will remain important, as it will continue to employ around half of the population. As employment opportunities open up in the secondary and tertiary sectors, however, there will be a gradual shift in employment away from agriculture. Reforms to bolster supply-chain efficiency, as well as efforts to liberalise the food market, will support the sector's outlook in 2020-24.
There is significant scope for investment to enhance the sector's productivity, as almost half of all cultivable land remains dependent on annual monsoon rainfalls, rendering the sector vulnerable to poor or unevenly distributed rains. The government has recognised this vulnerability and has increased funding for irrigation schemes and crop insurance. As agriculture faces growing risks related to the availability of water, the success of these efforts will prove crucial to ensuring long-term sustainability. However, capital investment into the sector will be inadequate, and the bulk of public funding will continue to come in the form of populist short-term subsidies aimed at securing political support from farmers. We forecast that the agriculture sector will grow by 3.3% a year on average in the forecast period.
The industrial sector will expand at a robust pace after the coronavirus pandemic, as the business environment improves and the country's strong economic growth outlook attracts investment. We expect the sector to grow by an average rate of 4.1% a year in the forecast period. However, the share of industry in total GDP will remain relatively stable, increasing slightly from 27.5% in 2019/20 to 28.1% in 2024/25. Manufacturing will remain particularly concentrated in a few sectors, such as the automotive industry, and in a few geographic locations. This will render it vulnerable to sectoral swings, such as the downturn in demand for cars in 2019.
Government efforts to lift manufacturing employment and output are highly ambitious but will miss their targets; these include the "Make in India" initiative (which targets 100m additional jobs in manufacturing and a rise in its share of GDP to 25% by 2022), the "self-reliant India" package and the administration's special economic zone strategy, which is intended to develop manufacturing hubs throughout the country. In the absence of greater liberalisation of laws governing land acquisition and the labour regime, industrial expansion will lag behind potential, which will weigh on employment opportunities.
Accounting for 47.2% of GDP in 2019/20, the services sector will continue to be the main engine of economic expansion. Apart from the severe disruption caused by the pandemic, the sector has shown itself to be resilient and not entirely dependent on buoyancy in external markets. The sector's expansion will continue to be driven by already strong areas of activity such as telecommunications, as well as by services in numerous high-potential but currently underserved areas, including healthcare, retailing, hospitality and education. Information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services will remain a major source of export revenue, even as growth slows in the face of increased competition from countries such as the Philippines. Services will form a key sector of the economy in the forecast period, expanding by 3.5% a year on average, and its share of GDP will rise to 46.8% by 2024/25.

Economic forecast: Inflation % 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024
Consumer prices 3.7 5.1 3.8 4.5 4.2 4.4
Average wages 7.7 4.1 6.9 9.5 9.4 9.6
Real wages 3.8 -1.0 3.0 4.8 5.0 5.0
Unit labour costs (US$) 3.1 5.1 3.4 3.9 4.3 3.4
We expect consumer prices to increase by an average of 5.1% in 2020 as a whole. While food price inflation has remained elevated during the lockdown, we expect it to moderate once supply-side constraints ease, towards the end of the third quarter. Non-food inflation will continue to lag behind food inflation, helping to prevent a rapid pick-up in the overall consumer price index (CPI). Our forecast assumes a normal monsoon this year (and in every year of the outlook period).
Relatively subdued inflationary pressures in 2021 will afford the RBI scope to keep its policy rate unchanged in 2021 as it continues to support the economy. The adoption of a tighter monetary policy stance in 2022 will offset the inflationary impact of strengthening oil prices. The central bank will accord higher priority to containing inflationary pressures towards the end of the forecast period; consumer price inflation is expected to average 4.4% in 2024.
Low oil prices and reduced domestic demand will generate producer price deflation of 0.4% in 2020. As prices for oil and other commodities strengthen, producer price inflation will firm to an annual average of 3.6% in 2021-24.

The RBI's adoption of a fairly aggressive loosening stance in 2020, along with a sharp contraction in economic activity, will weigh on the exchange rate. We forecast that the rupee will depreciate by 6% on an annual average basis, to Rs74.9:US$1 in 2020, as the domestic economic situation worsens and investments move to safe-haven currencies. While some support will be provided to the currency by a current-account surplus, the central bank's efforts to build-up foreign-exchange reserves will more than offset it.
In 2021 we expect the rupee to appreciate slightly, to an average of Rs73.9:US$1, as foreign investment returns. The rupee will depreciate in 2022-24 amid rising oil prices and a persistent current-account deficit.

Lower oil prices and extremely weak domestic demand will contribute to India registering a current-account surplus equivalent to 0.9% of GDP in 2020, the first since 2004. The contraction in merchandise imports is expected to be sharper than that in exports because of the rampant spread of the virus domestically, leading to the surplus. However, merchandise imports are expected to rebound in 2021 amid a pick-up in domestic demand, returning the current account to a deficit.
Increased competition from other countries and changing industrial trends will weigh on the pace of growth in India's main service export sectors, particularly business-process outsourcing (BPO) and information technology (IT). Nevertheless, the services balance will remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, making a positive contribution to the current account. Owing to the large shortfall on merchandise trade, however, the current account will remain in deficit from 2021, averaging 1.1% of GDP in the remainder of the forecast period.
Significant foreign investment into Reliance Jio, a telecom operator, will support inward investment in 2020. However, foreign investment in the overall economy will be depressed in 2020-21. Inward investment will pick up from 2022 onwards, as the expanding economy and growing consumer demand provide opportunities for businesses and the business environment improves under the government's reform agenda.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in India Stocks and flows India's large market and growing economy make it a favourable destination for foreign investors. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into India have been strong in recent years, and in 2019 the country received US$50.2bn in FDI inflows. This compares favourably with an average of US$17.8bn in 2005-07, before the outbreak of the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Owing to an attractive growth outlook and significant market opportunities, the stock of inward FDI has been expanding rapidly, standing at US$426.9bn in 2019 (markedly higher than in 2010, when it stood at US$205.6bn). The 2019 figure was also higher than the corresponding stock in Indonesia (US$292bn) but significantly lower than in China (US$1.8trn) and Brazil (US$819.5bn).
Origin and distribution According to the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), the largest source of FDI is Mauritius, which accounted for 30.4% of FDI inflows between April 2000 and March 2020. (Many foreign companies investing in India are incorporated in Mauritius for tax reasons.) Singapore is catching up quickly, as a similar tax treaty is reached and rates of taxation are among the lowest in Asia. Singapore surpassed Mauritius in fiscal years 2018/19 and 2019/20 (April-March), while it was the second most important foreign investor between April 2000 and March 2020, accounting for 20.8% of cumulative inflows. It is followed by the Netherlands (7.2%), Japan (7.1%) the US (6.3%) and the UK (6.0%). The most important sector for FDI is services, which attracted US$82bn between April 2000 and March 2020 and accounted for 17.5% of cumulative inflows, according to the DIPP. The computer software and hardware sector is the second-largest recipient, attracting US$44.9bn in the same period. The state of Maharashtra, which boasts the country's financial centre, Mumbai, is the largest recipient of FDI, garnering 30% of the total between April 2000 and March 2020. This was followed by Karnataka, which includes Bangalore, the nation's information technology hub, and received 18% of total FDI in the same period.
Determinants India's skilled, English-speaking workforce has been a significant attraction for FDI, particularly in the information technology (IT) sector. Since coming into office the current government has liberalised the FDI regime in a number of areas, including defence, pharmaceuticals, civil aviation and single-brand retailing. It has also done away with the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, an agency that was tasked with considering and recommending FDI on a case-by-case basis. The current administration will continue to open up the economy to foreign investors. However, more minor bureaucratic restrictions are often left unaddressed. Difficulty in acquiring land and laying off workers persists, along with other legal uncertainties, impeding the inflow of investment and hampering the ease of conducting business in India for foreigners.
Impact FDI has had the greatest impact on India's software industry and IT-enabled services. Call centres and other forms of back-office administration have become important industries, but India is moving up the value chain. The financial, pharmaceutical, telecommunications and power sectors have also been influenced significantly by FDI. The online retail sector is likely to be similarly transformed, with US-based Amazon and Walmart (through its Flipkart subsidiary) now having a significant presence in the e-commerce sector. Many online start-ups have been able to attract attention from venture capitalists and internet giants in the West. However, in offline retail, a significant relaxation of regulations for multi-brand retailers is unlikely to occur during 2020-24.
Potential Given the size of its market and rapid economic growth, India is attracting a significant amount of FDI, but the potential for even stronger inflows is reduced by relatively poor infrastructure, excessive bureaucracy and wrangling between government departments. The infrastructure, energy, telecoms, IT and insurance sectors are likely to be the key areas for FDI in 2020-24. Biotechnology and vehicle manufacturing (including parts) could also attract significant interest over the next five years. However, the serious economic contraction in 2020 will make some producers wary of entering the local market in the short term.

The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that the population will grow by 0.9% a year on average in 2020-24, down from 1.1% in 2015-19. This slight slowdown is linked to an improvement in living standards, urbanisation and generally improving economic conditions for women, which are resulting in women having fewer babies. According to data from the World Bank, the total fertility rate fell to 2.2 children per woman in 2018, from 3.3 in 2000. India is likely to reach the replacement level of fertility-2.1 children per woman-very soon. In the coastal states, the fertility rate is already below the replacement rate. However, poor and populous states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar will continue to record strong population growth, adding to social tensions and exerting further pressure on the already overloaded infrastructure.
High levels of gender disparity will increase the risk of social unrest By 2024 men will outnumber women by almost 50m. According to the latest census, held in 2011, there were just 919 girls for every 1,000 boys under the age of six, marking a decline from the previous census, which showed that there were 927 girls for every 1,000 boys. More recent research from the National Family Health Survey, conducted in 2015-16, shows that a skewed sex ratio exists across almost the entire country (the gender disparity is more pronounced in urban regions than rural areas). Historically, countries with wide gender disparities have tended to suffer from higher levels of social disorder, and we do not expect India to be an exception. Social tensions will be more notable in urban areas, fuelled partly by the inability of many men to find suitable employment opportunities.
Caste factors will be another important source of social strain within India in 2020-24. The Hindu-nationalist populism promoted by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government will have complex effects. On one hand, it is likely to re-energise Hinduism, which could lead to renewed emphasis on traditional caste roles. On the other hand, the government appears supportive of affirmative action policies that favour caste-based "reservations" (quotas) for jobs and public services such as education, which may help those in low-status castes. Caste groups (including higher-status castes) that do not currently enjoy special job quotas, especially in public-sector jobs, will push for them in the next five years. Regardless of the government's policy approach, the ongoing trend of workers moving from conservative rural regions to more metropolitan urban areas will help to slowly weaken the roots of the caste system.
The agriculture sector will continue to employ the bulk of the labour force Growth in the working-age population will remain relatively strong, at 1.1% a year on average in 2020-24. However, unlocking the economic benefits from population growth will prove challenging. In the 1990s and 2000s China was able to transfer workers from agriculture to more productive work in the cities, thereby boosting economic growth and exports. However, India's manufacturing sector has failed to take off in a similar manner. The manufacturing sector in India boasts more success in capital-intensive industries than labour-intensive ones. Although the sector is set to grow, it is unlikely to provide enough jobs for all the migrants from rural areas, particularly because of advancing automation. Services will also provide new jobs, but many of these will not be suitable for low-skill workers. Many of those employed in the informal sector in urban areas will lose their jobs amid stringent containment measures, and will have to return to rural areas in 2020-21. Agriculture will thus remain the mainstay of employment.
A key challenge for the country's long-term development is the poor state of primary-level education. While enrolment rates have risen, educational outcomes remain abysmal, especially in the public sector. This reflects multiple factors, including underqualified and undisciplined teachers, the impact of caste within the education system, a lack of proper evaluations and bad infrastructure within schools. The situation has resulted in strong demand (even among poor households) for private education, including online courses.
Weaknesses in other parts of the education system will also come to the fore as more students seek secondary and tertiary education. Few universities operate at world-class levels, and most graduates are unequipped for the demands of employers-even in sectors such as engineering, which are crucial for long-term growth. The growing politicisation of the tertiary education sector and the authorities' lack of focus on improving educational standards mean that Indian universities will broadly continue to underperform. A few clusters of excellence will gradually emerge, however.

The middle class will continue to grow after the pandemic Even though The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the economy to shrink at a record pace in fiscal year 2020/21 (April-March), we still expect the country to post rapid rates of growth once the coronavirus (Covid-19) passes. A sustained economic recovery from 2021/22 will help to lift personal disposable income back to levels seen before the pandemic took hold. India's huge population will become an increasingly important market for consumer goods. Household consumption expenditure will rise from US$1.6trn in 2020 to US$2.3trn by 2024. However, GDP per head (at market exchange rates) will remain low at just US$2,606 in 2024, compared with US$14,142 in China and US$8,040 in Brazil in the same year. This will limit the bulk of consumer spending to food and basic necessities. This low average nevertheless masks the presence of a growing number of middle-class households, which offers considerable potential for suppliers of higher-value products and services. The rapid growth in personal incomes from 2021, combined with a more open domestic market, will make India an increasingly attractive market for foreign companies. Significant regional economic disparities exist, and the levels of opportunity for retail businesses will vary greatly across the country in the forecast period.
Growth in the e-commerce segment will be robust Opportunities for e-commerce will grow rapidly in urban areas, owing to their increasingly well-educated populations and growing penetration of broadband and smartphones. Foreign firms are positioning themselves to take advantage of this trend. In 2018 Wal-Mart (US) acquired a controlling stake in Flipkart, an Indian e-commerce company, and it competes aggressively with the local unit of Amazon (also US). Reliance, a local conglomerate, opened an e-commerce business, Jiomart, in April 2020. As India returns to a solid growth path in 2021-24, and as internet penetration rises, the share of e-commerce in the country's consumer market will rise, creating opportunities for both domestic and foreign firms. Nevertheless, regulation will provide some obstacles to their competitive capacity. The administration has imposed strict restrictions on retail-related e-commerce businesses, and even during the March-June lockdown, e-commerce businesses were banned from selling non-essential goods. Foreign firms see these measures as discriminatory, and the government will come under pressure to revise them in 2020-24.
As Indian consumers become more aware of international brands, imports of electronics and consumer goods will rise. Urban consumers tend to display more brand loyalty, especially to high-end brands, than their rural counterparts and value loyalty programmes. For most Indians price will remain the main determinant of the level of demand. Companies in the fast-moving consumer goods sector tend to address affordability by offering products in smaller sizes. This practice serves as a way to develop brand loyalty among new consumers.

As in most developing countries, food constitutes by far the largest category of consumer expenditure. Indeed, spending on food as a percentage of income will remain relatively stable during 2020-24, as households increase the share of more expensive foods, like meat, in their diets. Spending on transport and communications will increase as mobility around India rebounds from the virus-induced slowdown in 2020. The relatively poor state of government-provided services means that as Indians become richer, they will spend an increasing amount on private education.
Local factors will continue to shape consumer preferences Several non-income-related factors must be weighed carefully when assessing prospects in the Indian market. First, purchasing power is as location-specific as it is income-sensitive, and prices can vary to a considerable degree even from city to city, let alone between urban and rural areas. Second, cultural factors matter to a significant degree. Third, Indian consumers, including those who are moving up the income scale, are highly price-conscious. Fourth, it is important to note that there is hardly a single characteristic that applies across the entire country. India is a widely varying collection of markets, necessitating region-specific strategies. Finally, the steady expansion of consumer finance and the growth of a credit-card culture will increase the number of consumers in the forecast period.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Initial conditions: The Indian economy began to move away from a state-directed socialist model in the early 1990s, when a balance-of-payments crisis triggered the first round of economic reform and market liberalisation. Since then, India has recorded rapid rates of expansion, with annual real GDP growth of 5% in fiscal years 1991/92-2019/20 (April-March). However, India's share of world GDP (at market exchange rates) remains low, at around 3.3% in 2019, compared with its 17.9% share of the world's population. This highlights the fact that there is still significant scope for further economic development. Low average productivity in India remains a key reason for widespread poverty. The gap in productivity between the agriculture sector and high-growth industries such as information technology (IT) is vast. Corruption is still endemic among local authorities, despite the fact that attempts to reduce graft have made progress at the higher levels of government under the Bharatiya Janata Party (which has led the ruling coalition since 2014). India's courts have long suffered from crippling understaffing, and a case backlog has built up over decades. However, the judiciary is largely independent of the government.
The skills mismatch will persist as education and training remain poor Demographic trends: Continued growth in the working-age population over 2020-50 will support India's economic expansion. However, even as the economy grows, a large proportion of the workforce will not find employment in productive formal-sector jobs. A mismatch between the skills offered by the country's workers and the demands of employers will persist for at least the next two decades, as the quality of teaching provided by the country's education and vocational training systems remains poor. Meanwhile, the rise of automation and growing use of artificial intelligence will dampen employment gains, even as India-based enterprises capture a larger market share of global manufacturing. Reaping the demographic dividend will prove immensely difficult in this environment. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the vast majority of the workforce to be absorbed by low-productivity occupations in the urban services sector in 2020-50. Still, opportunities for better-educated Indians will proliferate amid rapid growth in professional services, manufacturing and high-technology areas such as telecommunications, IT and pharmaceuticals.
Continued migration to prosperous areas could stoke social tensions Divergence in economic fortunes within the country will result in strong pressure for Indians from poorer states to move into more prosperous areas. In the absence of major governance improvements, states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar will be a source of internal migrants, putting pressure on scarce resources in more prosperous and economically dynamic cities such as the capital, New Delhi, and the financial hub, Mumbai. There is strong divergence in fertility rates between states, with Bihar and Uttar Pradesh recording high total fertility rates (TFR) of 3.2 and 3 respectively in 2017; the more prosperous state of Kerala had a TFR of 1.7 in the same year. This diversion will continue in the long run, and the population of Uttar Pradesh alone could surpass 400m by the middle of the century. Significant levels of internal migration will be a source of political and social tensions. Meanwhile, workers will continue to look abroad, to areas such as the Gulf region and the US, for economic opportunities. Inflows from their remittances over the next few decades will be an important driver of economic activity in some states.
The unequal gender distribution of India's population will remain a threat to social stability over the outlook period. According to the latest census, conducted in 2011, for every 1,000 boys under the age of six there were only 919 girls. Child mortality rates are higher for girls than boys, and female foeticide is practised. As this trend continues, a major imbalance between the numbers of men and women will undermine social stability.
India's diplomatic, economic and military power will increase External conditions: As its economy expands in size, India will become an increasingly important diplomatic, military and economic power. Successive governments will seek to ensure India's primacy within South Asia and to cultivate ties with regional neighbours-excluding Pakistan, India's long-standing rival. We expect India's relationship with Pakistan to remain tense, as the two countries will struggle to reconcile political and strategic differences, especially on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir. Temporary bouts of high tension are likely. However, the growth differential between India and Pakistan will remain high, suggesting that India's military advantage over its rival will increase. Over time, this should deter Pakistan from initiating conflict. China's presence in South Asia (especially in Pakistan) will push India towards adopting a more defensive posture to shield its domestic market from China. Shared strategic and economic interests will bind India more closely to Japan and the US. Still, even as it becomes a major diplomatic power, India will remain hesitant to align itself fully with the West. This is partially related to India's complex relationship with Russia, which has been a major source of military equipment. Long-standing links with the Gulf region and Africa and deepening investment ties will provide India with the opportunity to expand its political, economic and cultural engagement in these regions over the period to 2050.
Institutions and policy trends: Although political power will be centralised under the current prime minister, Narendra Modi, in the 2020s, we expect this trend to reverse once he leaves office. Differences in policy approach at state level will thus have a significant impact on economic outcomes. Reform-minded states will see growth accelerate, while poorer states will demand increased funds from the central government to balance economic disparities. Despite state-level differences, India's democratic political system will remain firmly entrenched. The country's legal system will generally remain impartial (if slow) and the constitution will be respected (apart from a trend away from secularism). Pledged reforms on labour law and land acquisition will make incremental progress, if at all. India's integration into regional and global value chains will nonetheless be constrained by a lingering tendency towards protectionism. New technologies and the emergence of an increasingly vocal middle class will help the authorities to curb graft, particularly at the local level.
Services will continue to dominate the economy in the longer term Long-term performance: We forecast that India's real GDP growth will average 4.2% a year in 2020-50. The country's economic progress is premised on a shift up the value chain in IT, manufacturing, business and information services, as well as other sectors. Continued government-led investment to upgrade infrastructure will improve the business environment and help to enhance the performance of the economy. Improvements in agricultural procurement practices and greater supply-chain efficiency will make rural India more resilient to weather shocks. A stronger agricultural sector will temper the movement of Indians from rural to urban areas, and the urban population will overtake its rural counterpart only by the middle of this century. However, the shift of the workforce from rural labour into more productive urban jobs will remain the main driver of India's economic expansion in the period to 2050. One major concern over the country's long-term economic performance is the extent to which the government can manage this transition. Upgrading the quality of public education will be crucial if the government is to achieve this successfully. We expect gradual progress on this front in the decades ahead, which will enable the country to expand the low-skilled manufacturing sector that will be crucial to its medium-term growth prospects. A gradual improvement in the quality of education will also lay the groundwork for the development of the higher-value-added sectors that will be necessary to sustain the country's growth momentum in the longer term. A much faster pace of improvement in education and much deeper reforms in business regulations would produce a much faster pace of economic growth over the long term; however, this is not part of our central forecast, and the economy will thus expand at a slower pace than its long-term growth potential.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability India will be highly vulnerable to climate change, and adverse changes in monsoon patterns could severely affect its agricultural sector, which remains greatly dependent on monsoon rain. More generally, water scarcity will become a challenge. Frequent floods have also led to massive disruption of business activity. The government has taken steps to manage the effects of climate change. However, given the scale of the environmental challenges that India faces, policy measures are unlikely to reduce the country's vulnerability to climate change significantly.
India is already the world's third-largest consumer of energy, and demand will continue to grow over the forecast period. The government is making efforts to diversify from conventional sources of energy, such as coal-fired thermal power stations. India is one of the most active members of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), which promotes the transition to solar energy, and the ISA has established its headquarters in Gurgaon, near the country's capital, New Delhi. India is likely to use the platform to leverage funding and assistance from developed nations and multilateral agencies to develop its own solar farm sector.
The country has also been making strides in developing wind energy. The National Institute for Wind Energy has estimated India's wind-power potential at 302 GW, with the states of Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Rajasthan having the greatest potential. Serious efforts in this regard have started; India's installed capacity in wind energy is now the world's fourth largest. According to the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog, the government's policy think-tank), around 304m people in India lived without electricity in 2017. Consequently, even as renewable sources of energy will make advances, the significant gap between supply and demand in energy will mean that coal-fired thermal power plants remain critical to India's energy mix.
In 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth, and we find that the Indian economy will be 3.7% smaller in 2050 than it would have been otherwise without this hit to growth.
Migration and urbanisation India will continue to see an influx of immigrants to urban areas, as workers move to cities for better-paid jobs. Public policy, which has long been rural-oriented, will increasingly have to tilt towards resolving overcrowding, poor housing conditions, anaemic infrastructure and declining sustainability in urban centres. The construction of urban mass-transit systems will increase sharply, along with other urban infrastructure such as roads, sanitation and power grids. However, the enormous scale of these challenges and limited government effectiveness will temper the pace of progress.
The biggest challenge for policymakers will be skilling and training the workforce of rural migrants, as they will largely move from the low-skilled agriculture sector and will be less proficient in the expertise required for productive employability in services and industry. Meanwhile, emigration to Western countries, particularly the US and Canada, as well as to the prosperous states of the Gulf, such as the UAE, will remain strong. As a consequence, India will remain one of the largest recipients of remittances in the coming years.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2015-19) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2020-24). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2015-19. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2020-24 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2015-19 ranges are then used to derive 2020-24 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2020-24, not to the likely situation in 2024 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2017 or 2022). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - Sebastián Piñera of the centre-right Chile Vamos coalition won the 2017 presidential election and took office in March 2018. A change to a more pro-portional electoral system challenged the traditional domination of centre-left and centre-right coalitions; as a result, no coalition currently holds a majority in either house of Congress. This has culminated in legislative gridlock, which will slow the legislative agenda, although the need for consensus-building has kept policy centrist to date. The social unrest of 2019 resulted in a shift to more socially orientated, left-leaning policies, and this is likely to persist in the medium term. As a result, market-friendly reforms will be put on the back burner, although The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect a significant break away from existing business-friendly policies.

- Chile remains in top position in our business environment rankings for Latin America over the 2020-24 forecast period, despite the social crisis observed last year, and improves moderately in the global ranking. Although its economy will be hit by the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the policy stance towards foreign investors is not expected to deter-iorate and this will facilitate a relatively firm recovery in foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly later in the forecast period. Chile's strengths will continue to lie in an open foreign investment regime, a broadly level playing field, open trading relationships, and deep and sophisticated capital markets. Improvements to education and infrastructure-including renewable energy supply during the forecast period-will further underpin the environment for business.

- Annual real GDP growth will average 1.9% in 2020-24. This is a softer pace of growth than in the previous five-year period, mainly owing to the sharp contraction in real GDP (6.4%) expected in 2020 amid the pandemic. This will be followed by a strong recovery process relative to regional peers, although output will not reach pre-coronavirus levels until 2022. The current account will spring into surplus temporarily in 2020, as exports and copper prices recover faster than demand for imports and oil prices. It will return to a deficit thereafter, owing to higher debt repayments and profit repatriation by multinational firms, but it will remain manageable. Deficits will be financed through capital inflows, particularly foreign direct investment (FDI).

- At an estimated 19m in 2019, Chile's small population is growing, but at a slower rate than most of its neighbours. Chile's birth rate has fallen steadily in recent years, from 16.4 per 1,000 people in 2002-07 to 13.9 per 1,000 in 2014-18. Chile also has an older demographic profile than most in the region, with those aged 65 years and over accounting for more than 10% of the total population-a proportion that is set to rise to 14% by 2023. As a result, the dependency ratio has been rising and stood at 45.7% in 2019. The labour force is forecast to grow by an average of 0.6% in 2020-24. Health indicators are broadly comparable with those of other OECD economies.

- Retail services and import demand will remain sluggish in the near term, reflecting the hit to consumer sentiments stemming from the pandemic, but will pick up thereafter as the economy steps out of the crisis and income losses are recuperated. Ample government infrastructure concessions and expansion in the renewables sector will provide opportunities. Chile's market opportunities are constrained by its relatively small population; however, free-market policies, relative political stability and effective economic management, will continue to attract investment.

Free-trade agreements within and outside the region will help to attract foreign investment. Average annual GDP growth is forecast to reach 2.4% in 2020-30, accelerating to 3.5% in 2031-50. The capital stock will continue to grow and investment will reach 27.3% of GDP by 2050. However, as growth in the working-age population slows, so will the increase in labour supply, causing economic growth to become more dependent on productivity gains.

a Actual.
Background: In 1988 the military ruler, Augusto Pinochet, lost a referendum that would have allowed him to stay in office. Instead, the centre-left Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia coalition (later Nueva Mayoría-NM) won the December 1989 general election and the next four presidential elections. A realignment of forces helped the centre right t0 win the 2010 election. Since then there has been alternation between governments on the right and the left. Michelle Bachelet of the NM, who was first elected president in 2006-10 before being succeeded by Sebastián Piñera (2010-14), was re-elected in 2014. Ms Bachelet was again succeeded by Mr Piñera, who took office in March 2018.
Political structure: The political system is presidential, with a bicameral legislature that comprises a 43-seat Senate (the upper house) and a 155-seat Chamber of Deputies (the lower house). The presidential term is four years and consecutive re-election is not permitted. This structure may be subject to change-possibly towards a more prime-ministerial model-as part of ongoing constitutional reform. The judiciary is independent, but the executive exerts some influence through the nomination of temporary judges and the control of promotions to the Supreme Court. Monetary policy is directed by the autonomous Banco Central de Chile (the central bank). Chile has 15 regions, 54 provinces and 346 municipalities.
Policy issues: The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, combined with growing public discontent with long-standing issues of inequality and a high cost of living, will result in the centre-right Chile Vamos coalition putting efforts at fiscal consolidation on the back burner and adopting a more expansive fiscal stance than before. This will be accompanied by accommodative monetary policy to contain the hit to the economy and financial system stemming from the pandemic.
Taxation: Corporate income tax is assessed at two stages. Declared profit is subject to a 27% first-category tax (FCIT). When profit is distributed to shareholders or partners, a 35% second-category tax applies, minus a credit for FCIT. The tax rate on dividends and interest payments to non-banks is 35%. Royalties and fees transferred abroad are subject to a 30-35% withholding tax. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at 19%.
Foreign trade: The general import tariff rate is 6%, but the trade-weighted effective average rate is less than 2%, owing to preferences granted through trade accords. In 2019 goods exports totalled US$69.9bn; goods imports stood at US$65.7bn.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Sebastián Piñera of the centre-right Chile Vamos (CV) coalition, who served as president in 2010-14, won the December 2017 presidential run-off and took office for a new four-year term on March 11th 2018. CV is chiefly composed of the conservative Unión Demócrata Independiente and the centre-right Renovación Nacional (Mr Piñera's party), but also includes the smaller Evolución Política (Evópoli). No party holds a majority in either the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) or the Senate (the upper house), but CV holds the largest number of seats in both chambers. The centre-left opposition is comprised of the parties of the former Nueva Mayoría (NM) coalition, which led the previous government (2014-18), and under a previous configuration the Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia governed Chile from 1990 to 2010. After the last election, the left-wing Frente Amplio emerged as the third-largest force in Congress. The centrist Partido Democracia Cristiana (PDC) broke from NM in April 2018, and currently forms the fourth-largest bloc in the lower house and third-largest in the upper house. Independent parties, which are largely on the centre-left, also have a congressional presence.
CV holds 19 of 43 seats in the upper house and 72 of 155 in the lower house. It relies on votes from other coalitions or dissident members of the opposition to pass legislation. In recent times-especially after the social unrest in 2019-internal conflict within CV has grown, with some elements shifting to support more populist, left-leaning policies, as with the pension withdrawal bill. The need to win back support from within CV and from the opposition will keep policymaking broadly centrist.

Political outlook: Political stability The president faces a turbulent year ahead, with the global coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic bearing down on Chile at a time of substantial domestic political uncertainty. A referendum on a landmark constitutional reform is due this year, and a presidential election is set for next year. In the meantime, the pandemic is having serious political consequences for a country that has been in the grip of protracted social unrest since protests broke out in October 2019. Although Mr Piñera's approval ratings saw a slight uptick in March-May, owing to a robust policy response by his administration to counter the economic fallout stem-ming from the pandemic, but even this modest boost has proved short-lived, amid criticism of the government's lax handling of the pandemic (the country has lacked a nationwide quarantine, and compliance with quar-antine measures in the capital, Santiago, has been poor. According to the latest poll by Cadem (a local pollster), approval ratings for the Piñera administration sunk to 16% on July 20th-from 23% in the first week of July.
Although Chile seems to have begun a flattening of its coronavirus curve and is bracing for a step-by-step reopening plan announced by Mr Piñera on July 19th, the government is far from out of the woods. Recent events, in the form of a popular, opposition-sponsored pension bill (which has secured congressional approval in line with our expectations), that allows early pension withdrawals of up to 10% of assets under management, suggest that the government will be susceptible to concerted opposition to its agenda, and will be powerless to prevent an element of populism creeping into policymaking. The pension bill had strong public support and was a trigger for renewed public protests. The bill even garnered the support of 13 lawmakers from CV, reflecting internal fissures within the ruling coalition, which could hinder governability and policymaking during the remainder of Mr Piñera's term.
Given that Mr Piñera has campaigned strongly against the passing of the bill, its approval in the Senate comes as a major political defeat for his administration, which will further undermine his political standing. His position will remain weak right up until the presidential election. Even assuming that the disease is brought under control (which The Economist Intelligence Unit expects to happen in the second half of 2020), there will be strong pressure on the government to fulfil its social agenda; we expect some hurdles in achieving this as fiscal resources have been increasingly stretched in the wake of the pandemic, and although some fiscal space is still left, this is less than what was available before the outbreak of the coronavirus. Although there is a strong possibility that regular protests will resume once the disease is under control, for now we assume that these will be smaller in scale than they were during the peak observed in October-November 2019. Although we expect policy-making to remain largely orthodox during the rest of Mr Piñera's term, there are increasing risks to this outlook, as highlighted by the opposition's bid to pass more populist reforms that could work towards undermining Chile's long-standing, business-friendly economic model.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Chile's system of government has been considered the most effective and technically adept in Latin America, owing in part to a relatively high degree of political stability and a highly professional bureaucracy. Political stability, however, has been under threat since October 2019, when mass protests broke out across the country against long-standing issues of inequality and a high cost of living. Since the peaceful transition to democracy in 1990, successive admin-istrations have operated amid a broad consensus around maintaining the open and liberal economic model instituted by the military regime of Augusto Pinochet (1973-90), while also strengthening democratic institutions. However, the 2017 election, under new electoral rules, resulted in a more fractured Congress, returning Chile to its pre-dictatorship political landscape of coalitions of the right, left and centre. This has slowed the legislative process and will continue to do so. Although so far consensus policymaking has resulted in broadly centrist policies, some polarisation could crop up over time, with extremes on the right and left gaining more power vis-à-vis the centre.
Political engagement and turnout remain low, posing a challenge to long-term confidence in the system. Although no coalition holds a majority (a situation that could continue in future governments), dramatic policy shifts are unlikely. That said, the social movement of 2019 and the coronavirus pandemic have pressured the centre-right government into relenting to more populist policies and a shift in policy to focus more on social trends could continue with future governments. Changes to organic constitutional provisions require a four-sevenths majority in both houses, while passing bills to reinterpret or modify the constitution require a three-fifths and two-thirds majority, respectively.
Corruption in Chile remains low, even compared with OECD standards-it is the 27th least corrupt country in the world-according to the 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index prepared by Transparency International (a global anti-corruption watchdog). Nevertheless, recent years have seen several prominent scandals in both the public and private sectors, which have fuelled public resentment. The scale of wrongdoing, however, is not equivalent to current scandals in other countries in the region, and public prosecutors have so far proved energetic in bringing a number of perpetrators to account.
A civil-service reform in 2003 helped to increase meritocracy by reducing the number of political appointees at the head of government agencies by over 80%, and by making civil servants accountable to an independent directorate. Official transparency and efficiency has also been fostered by the centralisation of the procurement tenders of all government departments and public-sector agencies into a single online platform. Chile's judicial system is relatively efficient and transparent. The criminal justice system was modernised over a period of six years, following reforms in 1999 that created an office of public prosecutions and established a legal aid service, as well as a new code for penal procedures. Chile ranks highly in most measures of rule of law, protection of private property and overall institutional effectiveness.
Political outlook: Election watch Crucial votes are approaching in Chile, including a referendum on constitutional reform that was one of the major outcomes of last year's social protests, as well as the presidential election late next year. The electoral schedule has been pushed back slightly as a result of the pandemic, in a measure that has received unanimous support. The constitutional referendum was also delayed to October 25th (from April 26th), the local primaries to November (from June), and the local, gubernatorial and constituent assembly elections to April 2021 (from October 25th 2020). We do not currently expect the postponement of the 2020 electoral calendar to delay the legislative and presidential elections that are due in November 2021.
We will be watching the presidential campaign closely for signs that the broad policy consensus, which has dominated Chilean politics, is fraying and raising the chances of a political outsider. For now, our forecasts are based on an assum-ption that, broadly speaking, the orthodox policy framework that has served Chile in past decades will remain in place in the next government, although we also assume a greater focus on social welfare in the aftermath of last year's protests and, more recently, Covid-19.
From the ruling CV itself, Senator Felipe Kast from the centre-right Evópoli has emerged as the strongest candidate for the presidency. However, public support has been the highest for Joaquin Lavín of the Independent Democratic Party-61% approval, according to a June 15th Cadem poll, with 12% of respondents believing that Mr Lavín will become the next president. Mr Lavín, who is considered a traditional right-wing politician, has veered to the centre in terms of his stance on social issues, as well as the much-debated pension with-drawal bill, which he supported. However, it is still too early to make a decisive election call, especially given that Mr Lavín has made no official statement about his intention to stand for presidency. The situation will become clearer once the dust surrounding the coronavirus settles.
Political outlook: International relations Although the government will direct its focus from foreign policy issues-such as regional and global integration efforts-towards policies aimed at tackling the pandemic and restoring domestic stability, some progress is still being made on the front of digital integration. For instance, on June 14th Chile signed a three-way agreement with Singapore and New Zealand, called the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement to enhance digital connectivity to ensure business continuity during the pandemic. The deal could give impulse to the recovery of certain industries that are integrated into the digital economy (such as retail services), promoting consumer confidence, enhancing productivity and compet-itiveness, and boosting job growth in Chile. In the long term, the deal could serve as the example for future international agreements on digital economies.

Many of the countries covered in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings (BER) will see some deterioration in the overall invest-ment climate during the 2020-24 forecast period. This reflects sharp economic recessions led by the coronavirus (Covid-19) crisis, which prompts govern-ments to turn inwards, prioritising domestic over foreign investors and pausing business-friendly reforms. Chile is one of the few countries that is expected to register an improvement (albeit slight) in its underlying BER score, which boosts the country's global ranking from 23rd to 19th place and consolidates its position as the most attractive investment climate in Latin America.
Chile's investment regime will benefit from a long-standing and well-functioning market economy, with an open investment regime, sophisticated capital markets and a large network of free-trade agreements (FTAs). A low public debt burden relative to the region provides the authorities with greater scope to tackle the coronavirus pandemic through large fiscal support packages for both businesses and households. The government's policy stance is unlikely to shift dramatically in any of the main categories comprising the overall BER. Chile's policies towards foreign investment, private enterprise and competition will therefore remain its greatest strengths in terms of the business environment. Foreign investment will be affected by a broader global downturn as business confidence weakens in 2020, but Chile's skilled labour force, firm rule of law and solid regulatory framework will entice foreign investors once global sentiment picks up.
A constitutional reform and populist policies would undermine business Our baseline forecast remains positive, but there are several factors that pose some downside risk in 2020-24. The first relates to the coronavirus outbreak. If the virus does not come under control and the economy sustains deeper and more prolonged damage than we expect, the government may come under pressure to change the policy stance, to the detriment of private-sector investors. Since the October 2019 protests, the government has been under significant public pressure to put business-friendly policies on the back burner and shift focus towards enhancing social security measures, reducing inequality and the cost of living. Additional risks stem from a possible reform to the constitution. The public is likely to vote in favour of rewriting the constitution in a national referendum scheduled for October. There is currently little indication of proposed amend-ments; this would be the responsibility of a committee that would also be selected in October. We believe that the reforms would respond to key social concerns that spurred the unrest in late 2019. Although we do not expect a significant rollback of existing business-friendly policies, the focus on new measures to improve the business environment will be less of a priority than before the unrest in 2019. Some opposition-backed populist reforms, such as the early withdrawal of pension funds, could seep into the policy framework, which would work towards undermining the business environment. Another major risk stems from next year's presidential elections, which could bring a major shift away from policy orthodoxy.

Chile's macroeconomic environment shifts from being one of its strongest areas of the business environment in the 2015-19 historical period to one of its weakest areas in 2020-24. This reflects the impact of both the late 2019 protests and the coronavirus pandemic on economic activity. Real GDP will contract sharply in 2020 as a result of suppressed domestic and external demand, and although we are forecasting a partial recovery in 2021, real GDP will not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2022 at the earliest. Although copper prices fell sharply at the start of the coronavirus outbreak, they have since recovered, providing some respite to the external accounts. We expect a faster recovery of exports coupled with continued import compression to result in a temporary movement of the current account into surplus in 2020. This will be followed by a gradual return to deficit as oil prices recover and import demand picks up.
Countercyclical policy will increase the fiscal deficit sharply
- A sharp widening of the fiscal deficit is also a key factor behind the deter-ioration in Chile's score. The public finances were in excellent shape before the pandemic, with a very low public debt burden and ample savings in sovereign wealth funds, which have enabled the authorities to implement a counter-cyclical fiscal policy in response to the crisis. Although extensive financial support will help to prop up comp-anies operating in Chile in 2020-21 (and is major factor driving the country's BER scores in other areas), the increase in the fiscal deficit has a significant negative impact on Chile's score in this category. Other areas of the macro-economic environment will continue to score strongly. A solid institutional framework and a general consensus over orthodox policy, free markets and integration in the world economy will remain unchanged.
- The Banco Central de Chile (BCCh, the central bank) has been indep-endent for over three decades, and its autonomy is unlikely to come under threat in the forecast period. The BCCh is complemented by an efficient banking supervisory body, the Superintendencia de Bancos e Instituciones Financieras, which has helped to maintain a modern and well-capitalised banking sector.

Decades of consistent market-friendly policy and reforms have kept Chile in pole position in Latin America, while it jumps two places in the global ranking for government policy towards private enterprise and competition. Following various privatisation programmes-mostly in the late 1980s under the military regime of Augusto Pinochet (1973-90)-Chile has only a small number of firms left in state hands (most notably Codelco, the world's largest copper producer). Governments on both the right and left have pursued market-orientated solu-tions to economic problems, which we expect to continue in 2020-24. In recent years red tape has been significantly reduced-for instance, since 2013 a firm can be created online in a single day and without high cost. Competition law is robust and is backed by an independent agency with broad powers to invest-igate and prosecute violations. A separate tribunal investigates claims of mono-polistic practices, including collusion and abuse of a dominant market position.

- In an effort to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy, in May 2018 the govern-ment launched the Oficina de Grandes Proyectos Sustentables (GPS), which is located in the economy ministry and serves as a one-stop shop for investors. As at July the GPS was co-ordinating 226 investment projects, representing US$68.5bn in investment in the next five years, and with the potential to create 77,780 new jobs. The GPS has been tasked with identifying and removing other investment bottlenecks.
- The platform "empresa en un día" (company in a day) was launched by the first government of Sebastián Piñera (2010-14) in 2013 to spur entrepreneurship. Since then, more than 550,000 companies have been created in Chile. In 2019 nearly 110,000 new businesses were created-a 7.3% increase from 2018. The total number of firms registered in Chile now exceeds a million, of which almost all are either small or medium-sized, and 1% are large. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) generate about 65% of all jobs.
- The state directly controls a handful of companies and holds stakes in another 22 businesses (as at end-2019) operating under the nominal oversight of the Sistema de Empresas Públicas (Public Enterprise System). State-owned firms are meant to generate value through fiscal transfers from their profits and by pursuing initiatives that improve social welfare, but are more or less unattractive to private-sector investors. They contribute to development targets in areas such as communications, defence, energy and natural resources, geographical integ-ration, and transport. There have been no major sales of government holdings since 2012; given the state's generally minor stakes, there is also little scope for further privatisations.

Chile's outlook for FDI inflows remains positive despite the pandemic Chile's score for policy towards foreign investment remains unchanged, despite the impact of the coronavirus on investor sentiment as first-quarter foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows have so far grown substantially in 2020, representing its strongest area of the BER. It also reflects the expectation that the impact of the pandemic on investment will not prompt a change in the govern-ment's underlying policy stance towards foreign investors. The country ranks second globally and will remain the top-ranked in Latin America (by some margin) during 2020-24. The foreign-investment regime is based on non-discrimination between local and foreign investors, as mandated by the constitution. The country grants foreign investors virtually unrestricted access to develop new ventures and acquire existing ones, which over the years has meant that the country has attracted substantial flows of FDI. Inward FDI rose to US$11.9bn in 2019 (from US$7.3bn in 2018), and we expect it to rise in 2020 despite the effects of the pandemic, owing mainly to a strong first-quarter performance. Our outlook for FDI remains positive for the remainder of the forecast period. A solid track record in terms of inward FDI in recent years, particularly during 2011-15 (when inflows averaged US$24.7bn per year), means that the stock of inward FDI per head is high, at just under US$12,000 in 2019 (compared with just over US$14,000 in the US). The country's natural resources and its long track record of economic and political stability, along with its openness to foreign invest-ment, means that FDI will recover faster than other countries in the region.

- Chile will remain one of the world's top destinations for copper mining investment. Before the coronavirus pandemic, the Comisión Nacional del Cobre (Cochilco, the state copper authority) had indicated that it believed mining investment would total US$72.5bn in 2019-28, with firms attracted by Chile's vast mineral wealth and close proximity to coastal ports. Cochilco has conceded that weaker demand will affect the copper sector in 2020, but has emphasised that it expects a rebound from 2021 and that it does not envisage a significant interruption to longer-term investment plans. We broadly share this interpret-ation, on the assumption that there are not damaging future waves of the pandemic, which would severely impact on demand for copper from China-a key importer. Copper prices are expected to recover from 2021, with China's longer-term infrastructure and urbanisation plans boding well for firmer demand. In turn, this will support firmer investment in Chile's copper sector.
- The Corporación de Fomento de la Producción (Corfo, the government's development-promotion agency,) and InvestChile (a new investment-promotion office) will continue to manage various industry-specific incentive programmes. Until now, these have aimed to promote investments in energy, forestry, marine activities, mining and tourism, but efforts may shift to focus on those sectors where a firmer recovery is anticipated. A separate government fund will also target the development of infrastructure projects. Corfo provides affordable financing, subsidies and tax credits for research and development, among various other incentives. InvestChile will continue to offer personalised advisory services to navigate the government's many investment-promotion programmes. We expect this broad structure to remain in place under the next administration.

Chile has more FTAs than any other country Chile's trade and foreign-exchange regime will remain broadly open during the forecast period, with the underlying score remaining unchanged and its global ranking improving by seven places in 2020-24. Although the coronavirus crisis will prompt a fall in foreign trade as a share of GDP, export and import volumes will not drop substantially enough to affect the underlying score in this category. Moreover, underlying policy will remain supportive and we do not expect the government to respond to the crisis by raising tariffs or veering away from a long-running commitment to free trade. We also do not expect any exchange restrictions to be introduced that would affect capital or trade flows.

- Chile has one of the simplest and most transparent trade regimes in the world. The country opted for unilateral trade liberalisation in the 1970s and has actively pursued FTAs to promote export-led growth. Chile has a single import-tariff rate, with very few exceptions, and has signed trade agreements with a broad network of international partners. As at July these totalled 29 agreements and involved 65 countries, which account for 88% of global GDP and 67% of the global population. Around 95% of Chile's trade is conducted on a preferential basis. The most important are FTAs signed with the EU (2003), the US (2004), China (2006) and Japan (2007). Chile also has FTAs with South Korea, Malaysia, Turkey, the European Free-Trade Association, Canada, Central America, Australia, Vietnam, Hong Kong and Mexico. Chile is also a member of the Pacific Alliance free-trade bloc-together with Mexico, Colombia and Peru-and has more limited agreements with India, New Zealand, Singapore and Brunei.
- The Piñera government signed an FTA with Brazil in 2018, just before the former Brazilian president, Michel Temer (2016-18), left office. The Chilean legislature ratified the agreement in July 2020, but the FTA has not been ratified yet by Brazil. Ratification is unlikely in the short term in the context of the coronavirus pandemic; at best it might come be ratified and come into force towards the end of the 2020-24 forecast period.
- With the failure of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) following the decision of the US president, Donald Trump, to pull the US from the deal, Chile and the ten other remaining countries signed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in March 2018. Mr Piñera submitted it to Congress in November and it was approved in the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) after a lengthy debate in April 2019. Ratification by the Senate (the upper house), however, was held up in late 2019 by mass protests and, in early 2020, by the coronavirus outbreak. However, we expect eventual ratification within the forecast period.

The government is seeking to simplify the current tax system Chile's score for tax policy improves slightly in the forecast period, allowing it to rise to 14th place globally in the ranking, with the country remaining best-ranked in the Latin American region. Total taxes paid remain relatively low by international comparison, but filing procedures are onerous. According to the World Bank's Doing Business 2020 report, it takes 296 hours per year to prepare, file and pay corporate income tax, value-added or sales tax, and labour taxes, compared with an OECD high-income average of 159 hours.

- There have been several reforms to the tax system in recent years. A major reform passed in 2014 raised corporate taxes and created a dual-taxation system that for many in the private sector was too complicated to implement fully. As a result, the government signed into law a "reform to the reform" in February 2016 that left only one system in place, the so-called semi-integrated system, in which companies pay a 27% corporate tax rate, and shareholders also pay income tax, but with businesses permitted to deduct some earnings if these are reinvested. In 2018 the administration introduced another reform proposal that aimed to simplify the corporate tax code and create a unified system that integrated the corporate and personal tax regimes. However, following nationwide protests that began in October 2019, the bill underwent extensive changes in the Senate, where the idea of a unified system was rejected. The revised proposal simplifies and lowers taxes for small businesses, and introduces a variety of new levies including a new income tax bracket for the wealthiest individuals, a 40% tax rate for those earning above Ps15m (about US$19,000) per month and a surcharge on the property tax for those with properties valued above Ps400m.
- Public frustrations about meagre pension benefits (which often come in at below the monthly minimum wage of US$400) was one of the factors behind the bout of social unrest that erupted in October 2019. The government had already tabled a pension reform bill, but as a result of the unrest the authorities amended the bill, increasing the mandatory contributions paid by employers by 6 percentage points and beefing up a solidarity component of transfers to the poorest pensioners. Regulatory changes are also proposed that would incentivise competition among providers and increase returns on investments. The govern-ment estimates that these changes will collectively increase pensions by nearly 30%. The government pledged to speed up discussions around the bill during March, but since then the coronavirus pandemic has slowed progress. In mid-July, the government confirmed that a legislative commission will shortly assess the bill; we expect approval and ratification before the end of the current administration's term.

Corporate access to finance will weaken in 2020, before recovering from 2021 Chile remains the leader in Latin America in terms of securing corporate finance, and its global ranking is set to improve by one place in 2020-24. Although the impact of the coronavirus pandemic will affect corporate access to finance in Chile, the fact that the banking sector was in solid shape before the crisis will mean that the impact on companies operating in Chile will be less severe than elsewhere in the region. A US$24bn credit line approved by the IMF will help the BCCh to ease monetary policy (through non-conventional means as the policy rate is already extremely low), which will feed through to the domestic banking system. Corporate bond issuance has dropped sharply in recent months on the back of the pandemic, but Chile continues to boast a sophisticated capital market with high levels of stockmarket capitalisation, and corporate issuance is likely to recover from 2021.

- Conservative lending practices helped Chile to avoid a credit bubble in the years leading up to 2008, and its low reliance on wholesale markets (even for subsidiaries of foreign US and European banks) enabled it to escape relatively unscathed from the 2008-09 global financial crisis and subsequent euro zone crisis. Nevertheless, the coronavirus pandemic has raised credit risks for lenders that are most exposed to the business cycle. We expect the system to be resilient, even in the context of the sharp deterioration in global conditions, with previous stress tests conducted by the BCCh showing that the banking system has enough capital and reserves buffer to deal with even a severely adverse scenario. That said, the cost of credit may rise in 2020-21, particularly for Chilean companies who operate in sectors most exposed to the downturn.
- Once underlying conditions improve, we expect large firms to benefit from easier access to long-term finance through credits and leasing, while some will also take advantage of other financing options, such as stock and bond issues, as well as what has been until now a competitive and flexible syndicated loan market for maturities of up to ten years.

Financing conditions for smaller firms will be even tighter, owing to Covid-19
- In contrast to larger firms, many small companies will find it more difficult to obtain bank credit, particularly in 2020-21. According to OECD data, just 18.6% of commercial lending goes to SMEs, one of the lowest levels in the OECD and well below other countries in the region; the level is 26% in Colombia and nearly 40% in Brazil. Small companies have often had to rely on 30-day credit lines, which have been more difficult to secure in the current environment. Part of the government's coronavirus support package is designed to improve the availability of credit for SMEs, while the Financial Market Commission has permitted the use of mortgage guarantees to safeguard SME loans. This will help to ease the problems facing SMEs, but overall financing conditions for these companies will still be tighter, making obtaining credit more difficult during 2020-24.

Chile performs less well in the labour market category, which despite some improvement in the score, remains one of the weaker areas of Chile's business environment in 2020-24. The improvement reflects the passage of education reforms, which will increase the supply of educated and skilled workers in the forecast period. These were introduced under the second government of Michelle Bachelet (2006-10; 2014-18) but will have more of an impact during the 2020-24 forecast period, owing to a gradual rollout of measures designed to address long-running deficiencies in the country's education system, which-although better than that of many neighbouring countries-lags behind that of the developing Asia region and other countries in the OECD (of which Chile is a member). The measures expand access to pre-school, university and vocational education. Businesses will continue to complain that the labour regime is too rigid and that it offers overly strong worker protections through restrictive regulations and high firing costs (one month's wage per year worked in the company). However, following social unrest in late 2019, no moves to pass legislation to scale back this protection are likely. On the contrary, measures such as a rise in the mini-mum wage and a reduction in the number of working hours will form part of a greater social agenda that is designed to placate restive public opinion.
Labour reform is in its early stages of implementation
- A labour reform approved in 2017 strengthened unions, as it expanded the categories of workers who can join a union, set a floor for negotiations (not permitting the weakening of workers' benefits) and prohibited the replacement of striking workers. It also prohibited the extension of benefits to non-union members. So far, the impact of the reform has been muted (only 9% of workers belong to a union, although the level is higher in the mining sector).
- Unemployment is forecast to virtually double as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, rising from 7.1% in 2019 to 15.2% in 2020. However, many of the jobs lost will be in low-skilled areas, meaning that skills shortages will remain a problem in some sectors.

Chile retains first place in the regional ranking for infrastructure in 2020-24 and climbs by two places, to 27th, in the global ranking. Chile's telecommunications and technological infrastructure is modern, particularly by regional standards, as the regulatory system for telecoms encourages competition and the early adoption of new technologies. The transport infrastructure is resilient and mostly withstands regular seismic events and other natural disasters. A series of natural disasters have impacted the country since 2010, including: an earthquake and a tsunami in 2010 in the centre-south region; earthquakes, tsunamis and floods in the north in 2014-15; the Calbuco volcano eruption of 2015; and wildfires in the centre-south in 2017. Virtually all damaged infra-structure has since been restored. Although a weakening of the public finances in 2020-21 will complicate ambitious plans for accelerated investment in a long-term infrastructure plan, we expect greater progress in 2022-24.

- Significant funding will continue to be channelled into transport infra-structure. A new underground railway line in the capital, Santiago, opened in November 2017. The government is planning to complete three new lines (numbered 7, 8 and 9), as well as extend three existing lines, but the timetable has already slipped and none of the new lines are now expected to begin operation within the 2020-24 forecast period. Additional transport funding will be allocated to the two largest metropolitan areas outside the capital, Gran Valparaíso and Gran Concepción, aimed at alleviating some of the congestion that these areas have been experiencing. Chiloé Island is also likely to be finally connected to the mainland via a 2.8-km bridge within the forecast period, despite repeated delays to construction.

New infrastructure plan aims to accelerate progress
- Chile's robust infrastructure is largely attributable to a successful con-cession system that was launched in the 1990s. Since the late 2000s, however, the number of new infrastructure investment projects has waned as the original group of projects reached completion. The government is trying to reverse this trend; in late June, it unveiled an ambitious US$50bn infrastructure programme that will cover the period 2020-50. The plan is front-loaded, with 45% of planned investment targeted for 2020-29. It focuses on the country's transport network, with over 60% of the plan dedicated to improving the road network. The plan also anticipates significant investment in the railway, airport and port provision. Most projects will be developed in public-private partner-ships (PPPs) with private-sector firms, although the authorities have not given a detailed breakdown of how much public money will be channelled into the projects. However, the government will struggle to make progress on this agenda at least in the near term; planning for the 30-year project started in early 2019 and its broad structure has not undergone significant change as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The authorities believe that improving transport infra-structure is necessary in the long term, but attracting private-sector investment in some of these projects (particularly those relating to airport expansion) will be difficult in the current environment.

The completion of a key transmission line will reduce costs further
- Although energy infrastructure has been seen as the weakest part of Chile's infrastructure matrix, this has changed since Ms Bachelet's second term (2014-18), with the implementation of a long-term strategy (Energía 2050) that extends beyond our forecast period. Other improvements include a decrease in the price of renewable energy-which helped to spur an increase in clean energy sources-and the connection between the north and central energy grids. These efforts have helped to contain the price of energy, which for years was a major hindrance to invest-ment.

Chile's ranking for technological readiness is the highest in the region, improving by six places, to 35th, in the global ranking. Its score is supported by strong internet usage, and efforts by successive governments to improve technological and innovative capacity. Chile is one of Latin America's most advanced telecommunications and IT markets, and is supported by a regulatory system that seeks to promote competition and IT sector development. Mobile and internet penetration levels are high, while smartphone ownership is the highest in the region. Nevertheless, investment in research and development (R&D) is low. According to the latest OECD data, R&D investment in Chile was less than 0.4% of GDP in 2017, compared with an OECD average of 2.4%.

- E-commerce has been growing rapidly in recent years and will accelerate further in 2020 on the back of the coronavirus pandemic. The Santiago Chamber of Commerce estimates that online sales exceeded US$6bn in 2019, up by 27% from 2018; online sales have reached US$4bn in the first half of 2020 alone. This partly reflects the closure of many non-essential retailers during the second quarter of the year, but more customers are likely to continue to make purchases online even as all shops reopen.
- Chileans are among the most avid smartphone users in the region, with about 85% of access to the internet carried out using a mobile phone. Nearly all mobile internet users use smartphones, which account for 80% of total internet access. Fourth-generation (4G) connections account for 85% of total mobile internet connections and continue to rise rapidly. Together with government investment, funding by internet service providers for the development of fibre-optic networks (which currently account for about 30% of fixed broadband connections) will continue to increase internet use, as well as facilitate faster upload and download speeds.

The science ministry will lead national science and technology policy
- The Ministry of Science, Knowledge, Technology and Innovation was created in December 2018 and oversees all policies, programmes and plans designed to strengthen innovation in science and technology. The ministry has a technical advisory committee, which will periodically review its policies, and an inter-ministerial committee-comprised of the ministers of science, finance, economy and education-tasked with developing a national science policy.
- As part of the tax reform bill currently before Congress, the government is proposing the imposition of a value-added tax (VAT) on digital services provided by international companies such as Spotify (Sweden), Netflix (US) and the accommodation site AirBnB (US).

Economic forecast: Policy trends The government is focused on tackling the health and economic crisis created by the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, and its policy focus has temporarily shifted from the social agenda to increasing the capacity of the healthcare system and bolstering the economy more broadly through policy stimulus. As Chile has slowly begun to flatten its infection rate curve in some places, the government is contemplating a step-by-step reopening plan for the economy, involving five phases-quarantine, transition, preparation, initial opening and advanced opening.
In the Santiago Metropolitan Region, the most-affected region in the country, reopening will depend on agreements with mayors and on epidemiological statistics. The economic policy response of the government has been the most robust in Latin America; the government has rolled out three rounds of fiscal stimulus, worth a total of US$28.8bn (12.1% of forecast 2020 GDP), aimed at improving primary health-care, supporting the incomes of the unemployed and informal workers, and providing loan support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the middle class.
Perhaps the most important piece of reform has been the early pension withdrawal bill, which, if approved (and The Economist Intelligence Unit expects this to be the case), will allow individuals to withdraw up to 10% of their savings from Administradoras de Fondos de Pensiones (AFPs, private pension funds). In order to prevent its passage, Mr Piñera offered a one-off cash grant of Ps500,000 (US$650) for workers who have seen their income decline by more than 30%, as well as an enhancement of the US$1.5bn support announced for the middle class in July, as part of the third stimulus package.
Although no mechanism has been established thus far to compensate individuals for their reduced future pension payouts, there is a risk that the government will be asked to compensate savers for lower savings and the interest lost on withdrawn amounts (the government estimates withdrawals to reach US$20bn or 8.4% of GDP). This could severely strain the country's increasingly stretched coffers.
We expect the stimulus package to soften the blow to domestic activity and help to increase the healthcare system's capacity to better combat the spread of the coronavirus. Conventional monetary policy has been stretched out to the maximum (with an interest rate at virtually zero) and the Banco Central de Chile (BCCh, the central bank) will rely more on non-conventional measures to boost liquidity in the financial system.
Once the disease is brought under control and Congress resumes operations at full pace, policymaking will shift back to the social agenda. Failure to do so would prompt a renewed bout of protests and unrest, which would be detri-mental to an economy already hit hard by the coronavirus crisis.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy Fiscal indicators

  2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024
Central government expenditure 24.1 32.4 28.7 27.8 26.3 25.5
Central government revenue 21.3 18.4 20.7 21.4 22.3 23.2
Central government balance -2.8 -14.0 -8.0 -6.4 -4.0 -2.3
We expect the central government deficit to balloon to 14% of GDP in 2020, in view of three rounds of expansive fiscal stimuli, totalling almost 12.2% of GDP, although some of the funds will be distributed over 2020-21. A gradual rollback of stimulus measures (amid economic recovery from 2021) will produce an incremental narrowing of the deficit, to 5.2% of GDP on average in 2021-24.
We expect government expenditure to spike to 32.4% of GDP in 2020, from 24.1% of GDP in 2019, in view of the large spending measures announced during the pandemic. Social spending will remain higher during the forecast period than before the protests, as the government seeks to address the concerns of protesters who have highlighted a problem of income inequality and inequality of access to public services in Chile. We therefore do not expect expenditure to fall to levels seen before the social crisis within our 2020-24 forecast period.
Government revenue will drop to 18.4% of GDP in 2020, from 21.3% of GDP in 2019, as revenue from tax collection will be substantially lower in 2020 than expected before the virus outbreak, owing to income losses and tax deferrals announced as part of the fiscal support package. We expect an expansion in revenue over the forecast period to be driven mainly by revenue from copper (as global demand and copper prices recover). The government's tax modern-isation bill, which was approved by Congress in January, also aims to generate an additional US$2.2bn per year (0.9% of GDP in 2020) in funds from tax collection.
In addition, opposition lawmakers have proposed a new wealth tax to the executive branch, of 2.5%, to be levied on those with more than US$10m in wealth. The executive has the authority to introduce new taxes without consulting Congress. Assuming that it is introduced (we expect this to happen), the new tax will raise about US$6bn and will be used to fund the Emergency Family Income plan. Based partly on new sources of revenue from the prop-osed wealth tax and the tax modernisation bill passed earlier this year, and partly on modest economic recovery post-coronavirus, we expect government revenue to increase from 2021, to reach 23.2% of GDP in 2024.
The higher deficit throughout the forecast period will drive up the central government debt/GDP ratio, from 27.9% of GDP in 2019 to 38% of GDP in 2020. The ratio will continue to increase throughout the forecast period and will reach 40.6% of GDP in 2024. We expect debt financing to come from a mix of sovereign wealth funds and bond issuance. Chile's two sovereign wealth funds hold a combined value of US$20.9bn (8.9% of GDP) as at April 2020.

Having taken rates to their technical minimum, the BCCh is now turning towards non-conventional monetary policy to support the economy, and we expect policy to remain quite loose for the rest of this year. The central bank has introduced a range of non-conventional measures to boost liquidity, including (but not limited to) a six-month conditional financing facility and a purchasing programme for bank bonds in the open market.
We expect a tightening cycle to begin later in 2021, based on the economy recovering as projected. This will result in real interest rates returning gradually to positive territory over the forecast period.

We expect the Chilean economy to enter recession this year-the first time since the global financial crisis in 2009-and to register a steep 6.4% decline in real GDP, owing to the coronavirus pandemic. However, among Latin America's major economies, we expect Chile to register the smallest decline and the strongest economic recovery (relatively speaking), owing to its robust policy response coupled with a strong institutional capacity to implement stimulus measures (in contrast, we currently expect GDP to contract by 12% in Argentina, 9.7% in Mexico, 7.7% in Colombia and 7.5% in Brazil). The difference can also be attributed to less stringent lockdown measures compared with many other countries in the region-with only the Santiago Metropolitan Region entering full quarantine.
The sharp projected downturn in 2020 is also a result of a strong negative carryover effect from the last quarter of 2019, when GDP contracted by 4.1% quarter on quarter. The lower base of comparison resulted in stronger than expected sequential growth-of 3% quarter on quarter-in the first three months of 2020. The economic brunt of the pandemic will be felt more clearly in the second quarter; activity contracted by 8.7% month on month in April-the sharpest downturn in activity on record-and by 3.3% in May. We therefore expect a real GDP contraction of 13.9% quarter on quarter in April-June.
An anticipated recovery (albeit incomplete) in the second half of 2020 should result in positive carryover in 2021, when we expect GDP to grow by 5.2%. This solid growth rate masks the fact that real GDP will not return to 2019 levels until 2022, although Chile's recovery will be faster than the Latin American average (we do not expect agg-regate regional GDP to recover to 2019 levels until 2023).
In 2022-24 we expect real GDP growth to stabilise at an average of 3.5%. This reflects an expected recovery in global growth and rising copper prices, which will contribute to recoveries in the external sector and domestic demand. We expect the contraction in GDP to be driven mainly by declines in consumption and investment demand. We expect consumption to fall by 4.8%, owing to income losses amid a rise in the unemployment rate.
We expect the passage of the pension withdrawal bill to severely strain the country's domestic financial system, as it will require AFPs to liquidate their long-term investments at a time when asset prices have been severely hit by the pandemic-thereby affecting the AFP's soundness-and will also erode the pool of capital available in the economy to carry out further investments. This will, in turn, weigh on already pessimistic investor confidence.
The erosion of pension funds will lower investment capacity and the liquidation of assets at lower prices (owing to the pandemic) by pension funds to finance withdrawals will deter investors further. We expect fixed investment to contract by 16.5% in 2020.
Industries operating away from urban centres (which are the biggest hotspots of the virus)-such as agriculture and mining-will manage to continue operations at near-full capacity. Mining activity has remained largely resilient to the pandemic-induced economic fallout, as most mines operate in isolated areas. Industries such as construction, manufacturing, and services (retail, restaurants and hotels, and financial services) will be the worst hit components of output.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends Mining will remain among the largest economic sectors and contributors to growth over the forecast period. With about 200m tonnes in proven high-grade copper reserves (24% of the world's total in 2019)-which are advantageously situated close to the sea-Chile has been the favourite global destination for copper mining investment over the past two decades. This has made it by far the world's largest copper producer, with output of 5.8m tonnes in 2019, equal to 28% of the global total. The mining outlook in Chile appears slightly brighter, but the sector will continue to face structural pressures owing to cost-cutting measures and falling ore grades.
Although copper prices are projected to be lower than in the 2006-13 boom years (especially in 2020 when copper prices are forecast to fall by 9%, with the coronavirus pandemic bearing down on global demand and trade flows), the country will remain a competitive mining investment destination because of its favourable geological conditions, as well as its relative economic stability. The market is divided between Codelco (the state copper firm) and private mining companies, with private firms accounting for two-thirds of output. Codelco was nationalised in 1971 and is the largest copper-producing and exporting company in the world. By law, the company is required to hand over all of its profits to the state. Major multinational mining companies with a presence in Chile include BHP Billiton (Australia), Rio Tinto (UK-Australia), Xstrata (Switzerland), Anglo-American (UK), Freeport McMoRan (US) and Grupo México (Mexico). There are also numerous local private companies, such as Antofagasta.
Output has weakened in recent years, mainly reflecting the decline of copper prices and ore grades. Output fell in 2016 and 2017, owing to a 43-day strike at Escondida, the country's largest mine, as well as flooding in several northern mines. Growth returned in 2018, as prices and investment recovered, but was short-lived in 2019, as strikes broke out in major copper mines amid the protest movement of October 2019. Copper production has remained more or less resilient-and in fact, has even grown slightly-so far in the face of the corona-virus outbreak, as most copper mines are located in isolated areas. With copper prices recovering, we expect copper production to cross the 6-tonne mark by 2021, with further gains thereafter.
Codelco has continued operations at near normalcy in the wake of the coronavirus. A proposal to privatise the company to generate funds in order to finance the country's coronavirus response was rejected by the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house), and we do not expect the company to be privatised during the forecast period. Declining ore grades have forced mines to invest heavily in order to maintain output and extend their lifespan. Codelco's output will decline in 2020-21 as the transition to exploit deeper ore reserves temp-orarily harms production. Codelco plans to invest US$40bn until 2026 as it seeks to maintain mine production-by extending the life of ageing mines and exploring for new ores inside and outside Chile-and meet tighter environ-mental standards at its smelting facilities. In order to support huge investment in Codelco, the government has moved to eliminate the Ley Reservada del Cobre (copper reserve law), under which Codelco hands over 10% of its gross export sales for the acquisition of weaponry and munitions by the military. Transfers to fund military purchases were required irrespective of the copper price and the impact on Codelco's finances, which has undermined its capacity to invest and the company's debt has risen to above US$16bn. However, these payments will be phased out gradually over 12 years and improvements to Codelco's investment capacity will occur in the medium term.
Codelco's investment plan comprises five major projects: the underground transformation of Chuquicamata (launched in August last year); construction of a new mine level at the company's underground El Teniente mine (with start-up due in 2023), which has been halted temporarily in the wake of the pandemic; the expansion of processing capacity at its Rajo Inca and Andina mines (due in 2021 and 2025 respectively); and an expansion at the Radomiro Tomic mine (due for completion in 2021). Codelco's production was 1.7m tonnes in 2019, down by 5.5% from the previous year. Although production during the pandemic has remained largely resilient (with output growing by 4.7% in the first half of 2020), the economy will struggle to boost output in 2020-21 to 2017-18 levels, owing to temporary investment delays, but will steadily ramp up production from 2021 onwards.
We expect global demand for copper to contract by 2.9% in 2020, owing to the coronavirus pandemic, but we expect China's copper consumption in 2020-21 to grow as manufacturing and services sector activity have already begun to recover. China accounts for more than 50% of world's copper demand and as Chile's main trading partner (accounting for 48% of its exports) it will support steady growth in copper production in Chile in 2020-21, although not at the scale observed before 2019. Once the global economy emerges from the pandemic, we expect stronger growth in copper production to set in.

We expect inflationary pressures to remain subdued in 2020, despite an initial spike observed in the first four months of the year, as currency weakness has dissipated to some extent. The annual inflation rate will average 2.5% in 2020, before returning close to the middle of the BCCh's 2-4% target range in 2021, where it will remain for the rest of the forecast period.

After a period of sustained depreciation earlier this year, the peso has regained ground and we expect some further nominal appreciation that will leave the peso at Ps725.7:US$1 by end-2020-still weaker than the rate observed at end-2019, amid the social crisis. After depreciating in the first quarter, by 13.7%, the peso regained some strength in the second quarter when it appreciated by a cumulative 3.5%. We expect the peso to stabilise at current levels in the coming months, before steadily appreciating towards year-end. We forecast that the currency will then continue to appreciate in the remainder of the forecast period, averaging Ps694.1:US$1 in 2021-24.

We expect the current-account to temporarily spring into surplus, albeit small, at 0.2% of GDP in 2020 (from a deficit of 3.9% of GDP in 2019), primarily driven by a sharp expansion of the trade surplus to 5.8% of GDP in 2020 (from 1.5% of GDP in 2019), in view of expected export recovery (which began in June) and continued import compression (albeit at a slower rate) in the rest of the year.
Compounding the uptick in the current account is the primary income deficit, which we expect to narrow in 2020 to 3.6% of GDP (from 3.8% of GDP in 2019), owing to a decline in profit repatriation abroad by companies working in Chile amid the pandemic. The primary income deficit will then widen throughout the remainder of the forecast period, entrenched by rising debt-service oblig-ations and a pickup in profit repatriation abroad. The former follows a rise in external debt to finance higher public spending during social unrest and the pandemic. This will lead the current account to return to a deficit from 2021 onwards, averaging 2.9% of GDP in 2021-24.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Chile Stocks and flows Despite its small size, Chile has historically been an important destination for foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly in its mining, energy and transport infrastructure sectors. FDI flows can fluctuate widely from year to year, often reflecting the fortunes of the copper mining industry. FDI fell dramatically between 2015 and 2017, from US$20.9bn to US$6.1bn. However, the decline bottomed out in 2018, and FDI inflows recovered in 2019 to US$11.9bn. Chile's favourable climate for foreign businesses pushed the stock of FDI to US$215.7bn in 2019, according to IMF data, resulting in an FDI stock/GDP ratio of 76.4%, compared with much smaller ratios for Brazil (44.6%) and Mexico (50%). Chile's importance as an investor in other regional markets has also increased in recent years, with a focus on the airline, shipping and retail sectors. However, outward flows have declined considerably in recent years, and totalled just US$8.4bn in 2019, down from an annual average of US$15.9bn in 2011-15. This reflected a global decline in crossborder mergers and acquisitions activity, and also political uncertainty throughout Latin America (where most Chilean outward investment flows) ahead of a busy election season in the region. A large stock of outward FDI in 2019 valued at US$152.2bn, equivalent to 52.9% of GDP (IMF data), is testament to the success of Chilean firms abroad.
Origin and distribution According to the latest data from the Banco Central de Chile (the central bank), Chile's largest source of accumulated FDI stock in 2018 was the US, which accounted for 13.4% of the total stock. Spain, Canada, the Netherlands and Italy accounted for another 36% combined. FDI broadly supports major investments in the mining, energy, agrarian (especially wine), wholesale and retail, telecommunications, financial services, and construction and infrastructure sectors. The last is driven by foreign firms finding opportunities under the government's public-private partnership concessions. However, much of the FDI flowing into Chile is routed through tax havens such as the Bahamas, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Luxembourg and Panama-which between them contributed a further 12% of the debt stock in 2017-making it difficult to ascertain the true countries of origin.
Regarding the sectoral distribution of FDI stocks, financial services accounted for almost 40% of the total in 2018, followed by mining (26.6%) and utilities (electricity, gas and water, at 8.4%). Other important sectors that have attracted significant foreign investment in recent years include manufacturing, transport, communications, real estate and business services, and retail.
Determinants Chile's foreign investment regime, which has been in place for three decades, is one of the most liberal in the world. There is a well-respected principle of non-discrimination between local and foreign investors, who also enjoy additional protection as a result of the rapidly expanding network of investment-protection accords and double-taxation treaties signed with other countries. Generally sound regulation, combined with political and economic stability, and firm growth, have helped to support FDI inflows since the early 1990s. Moreover, Chile's managerial talent and well-qualified labour force (by regional standards), together with a strong rule of law, low crime rates and a large network of free-trade agreements (FTAs), have attracted a growing number of multinationals to use Chile's capital, Santiago, as a headquarters for Latin America. Moreover, the entry of Chile into the OECD in 2010 made it subject to various investment-related provisions and guidelines relating to liberalisation of capital movements and trade in services (including business and financial services, insurance, culture, tourism, and travel).
Impact FDI had funded a growing share of gross fixed investment in Chile since the 1990s. In 2001-06 FDI funded 26% of gross fixed investment, contributing to the modernisation of infrastructure, including telecoms. The ratio rose to an annual average of 38.4% in 2007-15, owing to large mining and energy investments. Although it has slipped significantly since, reaching just 11.5% in 2019, it is expected to rise modestly to an annual average of 27.2% in 2020-24. FDI has made a major contribution in terms of the transfer of technology and managerial expertise, and has helped to foster competition between local and foreign firms in most major consumer markets, thereby providing Chileans with wider product ranges and lower prices than in neighbouring countries. Outward FDI has also grown as Chilean businesses expanded abroad, which has helped to establish many local firms as important regional players in their respective sectors. Although outward FDI flows dropped to a lowly US$580m in 2018, from an annual average of US$11.7bn in 2008-17, this is still a robust level (outward FDI stock totalled US$139.3bn in 2017, according to the IMF). The fact that Chilean firms operated in a competitive domestic environment, well before regional peers had liberalised their own economies, has enabled businesses to position themselves successfully in neighbouring countries. This has been most evident in the retail sector, where firms such as Ripley, Paris and Falabella have aggressively expanded into other markets such as Peru, Argentina, Colombia and Brazil.
Potential Chile will continue to attract large FDI inflows, owing to its transparent business operating conditions, political stability, a fundamentally sound economy, a huge network of FTAs, double-taxation and investment-protection accords, the most modern infrastructure in Latin America, and a growing pool of skilled labour. Nevertheless, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects FDI inflows to average a modest 5.5% of GDP annually in 2020-24 well below the level of 9% of GDP recorded in the bonanza years of 2008-15, during the commodities supercycle. The major acquisitions that have been common in the banking, telecoms and utilities sectors over the past two decades are unlikely to be repeated at the same pace, given already near-complete levels of economic openness and liberalisation. Nevertheless, the services sector (for example) will have ample opportunities in a market in which incomes are expected to continue to grow steadily. Renewable energy and related industries (such as lithium extraction) will also attract significant investment.

Working-age population grows slowly while overall demographic profile ages Chile's annual population growth rate is forecast to decelerate gradually, from 1.2% in 2019 to less than zero by 2024. This will bring the total population to 19.2m in 2024, leaving Chile as the least populated of Latin America's seven largest economies, and the only one of the seven with a population below 20m in 2024. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística de Chile (the national statistics office) forecasts that the rate of natural population growth-the crude birth rate minus the death rate-will continue to slow, from 8.6 per 1,000 people annually in 2010-15 to 7.4 per 1,000 in 2015-20, and to 6.2 per 1,000 in 2020-25. Although Chile displays a maturing demographic profile, the share of the working-age population will remain roughly stable, at 68% of the total, in 2020-24. The rise in the share of the population above working age (14.1% will be 65 or older by 2024) will bring this figure to one of the highest in Latin America.
Chile has traditionally been an immigrant-receiving country, although not to the same extent as other South American nations such as Argentina or Brazil. Since the 1970s most migrants have come from neighbouring Peru and Bolivia, with migrants often working in low-skilled jobs. However, the pace of inward migration has accelerated since 2005, with the number of foreigners in the country increasing by 123% between 2005 and 2014, to about 416,000, and in 2017 the government estimated that there were around 1m foreigners living in the country, of which roughly 300,000 were undocumented.
The surge in immigration is a consequence of the arrival of large numbers of Venezuelans and Haitians, prompted by humanitarian crises in their countries-and a rise in economic migrants from countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic-attracted by the higher wages and quality of life. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects net inward migration to continue, given Chile's relative prosperity, but it will proceed at a more moderate pace than in 2015-17 as the government has instituted new laws to control the inward flow. Outward migration from Chile peaked during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet (1973-19), but has slowed since then. The government estimates that 850,000 Chileans live abroad, largely in Argentina, the US, Brazil and Sweden.
Inward immigration will not boost overall population growth Chile's basic health indicators are similar to those of other OECD countries; life expectancy at birth in 2019 stood at 80 years (82.4 years for women and 77.6 years for men) and infant mortality stood at 6.2 per 1,000 live births, as per data from the World Bank. Infectious diseases and problems such as malnutrition are largely under control except in small pockets of extreme poverty. However, age and "lifestyle-related" conditions associated with sedentary living and increased consumption of processed foods-such as obesity (75% of the popul-ation are overweight or obese-the second-highest among the OECD countries), heart disease, colon cancer and diabetes-are on the rise.
Public healthcare policies will increasingly target obesity and unhealthy lifestyles. Only 2.5% of children under six years old were at risk of malnutrition in 2010, but 13.1% were overweight and 9.7% were obese. A universal healthcare plan, the Plan de Acceso Universal con Garantías Explícitas, was created in 2005 and offers fixed-price treatments for 80 conditions, including many expensive illnesses. The policy is sold at a fixed price and guarantees a maximum waiting time for medical attention for each condition. The public system covers around 80% of the population, against 17% covered by private insurance. During the social protests of late 2019, health sector reforms emerged as one of the key demands of protesters and this led to a slew of reforms to the health sector, including a reduction in waiting time, increased coverage of healthcare costs, lower cost of medication and increased spending per head on primary care.
The unemployment rate will soar amid the pandemic and fall slowly thereafter The economy was close to full employment in 2013-15, with average unemployment, at a historic low of 5.8%. However, furloughs and layoffs during the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic resulted in the unemployment rate reaching an all-time high of 11.9% in the second quarter. We expect the unemployment rate to continue to rise in 2020, before beginning a gradual decline over 2021-24. Informal sector workers are estimated to account for 36% of the labour force, according to the OECD; a low figure by Latin American standards (it is frequently more than half, even in large economies). However, the informal sector represents a large pool of untapped labour, which could-if brought into the formal market-boost long-term growth and tax revenue.

After contracting, income per head in US dollar terms will grow in 2017 Chile's market opportunities are constrained by its small population, at 18.9m in 2019 (forecast to grow modestly to 19.2m by 2024), but its high income-along with a legacy of political stability and effective economic management-will continue to make the country an attractive destination for investment in the region. In the past three decades it has generally outperformed all of the other economies in Latin America in terms of GDP growth and, amid the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, is expected to undergo the softest decline in output in 2020, relative to the other major economies in the region. The Economist Intelligence Unit also expects economic recovery from the pandemic to be among the strongest and fastest in Chile, with real GDP growth averaging 4% in 2021-24, owing to its robust policy (especially fiscal) response to the crisis and otherwise strong macroeconomic fundamentals. Income per head at purchasing power parity will take a serious hit in 2020, sliding to US$23,421 per person (from US$25,159 per person in 2019) as the unemployment rate and, thus, income losses rise amid layoffs and furloughs during the Covid-19 crisis. However, the deterioration in the living standards will be temporary as a recovery is expected to set in from 2021 onwards, with GDP growth outstripping population growth throughout 2021-24. Despite declining over the past decade, inequality will remain pronounced, with income discrepancies between metropolitan and northern regions, and less affluent regions in the centre-north and centre-south.
Potential for more exports and imports will remain strong Chile's productive potential is limited by its small manufacturing base, which is dominated by agro-industrial output. As a result, a large share of consumer goods-such as electronics, cars and clothing-are imported. Consumer confidence in Chile has been declining since 2018 and reached record-low levels in end-2019 at the height of the social unrest. According to the University of Chile's consumer confidence index, consumer confidence slid below levels observed during the 2008-09 financial crisis, coming in at 85.1 (with March 2001=100), and is expected to decline further amid the coronavirus pandemic. This, combined with a forecast decline in income per head, will decrease household expenditure on imports drastically in 2020. We expect it to increase thereafter in 2021-24 as the economy emerges from the pandemic.
Retail sales in real terms dropped by 1.4% in 2019 and declined further in the first half of 2020, owing to stoppages in activity and demand weakness during the health emergency. We currently forecast that the volume of retail sales will drop by 45.2% in 2020, growing thereafter by 3.4% on average in 2021-24, supported by a well-contained inflation rate, low real-interest rates and rising income levels. Export earnings have already started to pick up as copper prices recover, and a recovery in demand from China will boost export volumes.

The Chilean market is competitive, with a strong foreign presence Consumer markets in Chile are well developed and competitive, owing to a free-market-orientated economy that has encouraged participation by foreign firms, as well as import penetration for a wide range of consumer goods. This has helped to bring prices down and attract a large number of participants, despite the small size of the economy, in effect turning it into a showcase market for firms wishing to expand in the region. Some highly competitive sectors include telecommunications and retail. A deep and sophisticated financial sector, which has historically benefited from ample credit supply, relatively low interest rates and narrow loan-deposit spreads, supports consumer expenditure. Large foreign and local firms co-exist in the banking and insurance sectors, with the insurance sector enhanced by high and rising statutory obligations. Despite this, the conservative lending practices of the banking system mean that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often find it difficult to obtain financing; these conditions will worsen during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, despite fiscal measures and government-backed loan programmes. These constraints do not present a problem for larger blue-chip firms, however, which can access a wider range of financing options. Private financing for large companies will be forthcoming during the current crisis, as illustrated by the case of Chile's LATAM Airlines, which filed of Chapter 11 bankruptcy but managed to secure funds from private sources for its debt restructuring.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Once the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic subsides, Chile's long-term outlook will benefit from a return to adherence to prudent monetary and fiscal policies, coupled with a commitment to the rule of law and protection of property rights. A wide network of bilateral free-trade agreements (FTAs) and a liberal foreign-investment regime will continue to help Chile to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), while simultaneously assisting local firms to expand abroad. It has also helped to diversify the economy into areas in which the country previously lacked comparative advantages, although a pronounced bias towards mining (the country's single largest industry and source of exports), and in particular, copper, will persist. Chile's efforts to become a regional platform for multinational corporations will continue, facilitated by its reputation for relative economic stability and security, its well-developed financial system, and the quality of its transport and communications infrastructure, as well as a comprehensive network of FTAs, double-taxation agreements and investment-protection accords. Chile's track record in raising real incomes has made progress, with GDP per head-in US dollars at purchasing power parity (PPP)-increasing from 20% of US GDP per head in 1990 to 38.6% in 2019. This gradual convergence will continue as growth outpaces that of the US, to reach a forecast 63.1% by 2050.
Initial conditions: Chile is a small country, representing only a 0.25% share of the world population in 2019, but it overachieves in its share of world GDP (0.35% at PPP), and global exports are strong (0.4% of the total). Chile's GDP per head (at market exchange rates) of US$14,891 in 2019 was the highest among Latin American economies (excluding the Caribbean). In PPP terms, GDP per head was US$25,159 in 2019, which was also the highest among non-Caribbean Latin American countries. In 2010 Chile was the second country in the region (after Mexico) to become a member of the OECD. Chile will continue to attract manufacturing investment, but its competitiveness as a global manufacturing centre will lag behind that of its Asian rivals, mainly owing to its small size. Chile will continue to find success in non-traditional production such as agro-industry and fisheries, and possibly some consumer goods, once Asia's labour-cost advantages erode. As a commodity producer, Chile faces more volatile terms of trade than its Asian competitors, whose comparative advantage is founded on low-cost manufacturing rather than raw materials. This implies that Chile's growth will remain strongly linked to international copper prices for the foreseeable future, notwithstanding a substantial diversification away from copper and commodities in general. The peso remains weak against its 20-year average, which will help to boost competitiveness for non-mining exports.
Demographic trends: Although Chile's population is still young by international standards, its demographic profile is ageing. Annual population growth will average just over 0.2% in 2020-30; the working-age population is expected to continue to grow, owing to a drop in young-age dependency. However, the working-age group will start to shrink from 2022, which will bring a rise in the dependency ratio. Despite Chile's relative affluence and the quality of its social services, immigration has not significantly contributed to overall population growth in recent decades. Although it may begin to do so over the next decade, the effect will not be significant. As a result, the demographic outlook will be dominated by trends among the native-born population, whose birth rates will continue to fall.
External conditions: Growth in export industries will be boosted by Chile's large network of FTAs. However, the single most important external factor affecting the Chilean economy is the international price of copper. Prices have fallen substantially, from a peak of 400 US cents/lb in 2011 to a low of 196 US cents/lb in December 2015, owing to the global slowdown and the end of the so-called commodities supercycle. The copper price has since recovered to average 272 US cents/lb in 2019, but after taking a small hit during the coronavirus pandemic, is forecast to average 248 US cents/lb in 2020, and will remain at the mercy of global sentiment. In the long term, however, demand growth from China and India, as well as other emerging economies, will keep copper prices high by historical standards. Chile has diversified its export base over the past 15 years, notably into non-traditional sectors such as fruit, salmon and wine. Nonetheless, mining (mainly copper) still accounts for approximately half of total exports, and The Economist Intelligence Unit expects this dominance to diminish only marginally, given Chile's unique geological and geographical advantages in natural-resource extraction. Service exports will also grow, benefiting from Chile's position as a regional business hub. Open and liquid capital markets make the country the most developed financial centre in the region-and smaller in size only than Brazil and Mexico-with ample crossborder opportunities in banking, insurance and securities markets arising from deeper regional integration. Finally, growing international aware-ness of the country's significant natural beauty will provide a major boost to tourism in the medium and long term.
Institutions and policy trends: Chile will maintain its strong pro-market policy direction of the past three decades. However, social pressures and rising expectations of the middle classes will lead to an increase in public-sector participation in certain sectors. Governments will drastically extend state funding of university places (tertiary education currently remains highly market-orientated) and renewable energy. Civil-service reforms will support bureaucracy efficiency and transparency, and reducing red tape will benefit the business environment as administrative procedures are simplified. Modern-isation of the judiciary will accelerate legal procedures, which already benefit from one of the most independent and least corrupt judicial systems globally.
Long-term performance: Chile's tradition of policy continuity, abundant natural resources, a favourable investment climate and modern infrastructure will be supportive of firm economic growth in the long term. The Chilean economic model will remain investment- and export-led, based on solid macroeconomic fundamentals, monetary stability and countercyclical fiscal management. Productivity growth will be helped by investments in new technologies and a gradual move towards higher value-added activities (made evident by the shift from agriculture to agro-industry). The financial sector will remain competitive, owing to a large pool of institutional investors (private pension funds, mutual funds and insurance companies), providing businesses and households with ample financing through credit and capital markets.
In the long term, modernisation of the education system and a more flexible labour market will be necessary to unlock higher potential growth; both of these issues are being slowly tackled by the current government led by Sebastián Piñera. The linking of Chile's north and central-south electricity grids could prove the catalyst for a revitalisation of the country's fragile energy matrix, which has resulted in Chile having some of the highest energy costs in the region. The lack of major fossil fuel reserves will provide an impetus towards developing renewable energy sources, and the country is on course to meet a target of 20% power generation via renewables in 2020, five years ahead of schedule (a long-term objective of 70% by 2050 appears more than feasible). At the same time, there is significant opposition to major hydroelectric projects on environmental grounds, and some green alternatives such as solar energy remain expensive, suggesting that Chile will be burdened by energy insecurity in the medium term. Overall, The Economist Intelligence forecasts that average annual GDP growth will reach 2.8% in 2019-30, falling to 2.3% in 2031-50. As growth in the working-age population slows, economic expansion will become more dependent on productivity gains and less so on the contribution of labour.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Chile's long coastline and diverse topography leave it highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Changing climate dynamics will increase the likelihood and severity of natural disasters. These will directly disrupt agriculture and tourism, and glacial retreat will especially affect water resources. According to climate change projections by Chile's meteorological office, Chile's south-central area and the northern part of Patagonia should see temperatures rise and precipitation fall by around 60% between 2030 and 2059. Given that this is the heart of Chile's agricultural region-and also its farmed salmon industry-this will have a serious impact on the Chilean economy. Temperature rises affecting the oceans will also affect sea life, leading to a reduction in both the abundance and the diversity of species. This has been felt to some extent already in recent years, with an El Niño effect in 2016 disrupting the fishing industry, and a major drought affecting the country in 2018; this resulted in a water and agricultural emergency in the country. The Universidad de Chile says that at least 25% of the factors contributing to that year's drought reflect human action.
In January 2020 the government presented a draft climate change bill to Congress that sets a national target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, meaning that the country would emit no more heat-trapping carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions than can be absorbed in its forests. The bill will set a total greenhouse gas emissions budget for 2030 and 2050, along with adaptation goals for each sector, which must be met within ten years of the bill's passing. The bill secured approval from the Senate Environment Committee on July 9th and awaits a general discussion in the Senate (the upper house). If approved, the law is expected to establish a medium- and long-term framework for climate impact reduction, and to create the institutions to manage climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. In 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit has developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth, and we find that the Chilean economy will be 2.5% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth.
An ageing demographic profile Chile's demographic profile shows an increasing proportion of the population over 65 years old. In 2019 approximately 11.9% of the population was over 65 years old. This is expected to climb to 17% of the population by 2030. This makes Chile one of the oldest populations in Latin America and the Caribbean (behind only Cuba and Uruguay). In addition to a lower birth rate, this also reflects an increase in life expectancy in the past 20 years as Chile has become a more affluent society. The ageing of the population presents a unique challenge for a developing country, where (until recently) providing sufficient economic growth and jobs for a working-age population was the biggest task.
The effect of Chile's ageing population has already been seen in the country's politics, with the state of the country's pension system becoming a major issue in the 2017 election, as well as during the 2019 protests. The government has also had to address the fiscal costs of an ageing population by promoting the hiring of senior citizens (to keep them in the workforce) and incentivising the postponement of retirement. The government has also sought to increase the number of doctors specialising in geriatrics working in the public health system, and to adapt urban infrastructure to accommodate the needs of the elderly. The shrinking working-age population as a percentage of the overall population has also made immigration more attractive to Chilean policymakers. The country has bowed to political pressure to standardise its immigration system after a large inflow in 2015-17, but still remains committed to welcoming regulated inward immigration
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2015-19) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2020-24). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2015-19. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2020-24 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2015-19 ranges are then used to derive 2020-24 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2020-24, not to the likely situation in 2024 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2017 or 2022). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - Despite Venezuela's socioeconomic collapse and a public health crisis triggered by the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19), The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the civic-military regime led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela to retain power throughout the 2020-24 forecast period. Mr Maduro's position will be supported primarily by his grip over a complex security apparatus and the opposition's lack of de facto power. On this basis, we expect continued deterioration of the economy, sustained outward migration, and a poorer and more violent Venezuela. Despite US sanctions (and their impact on oil production), the Maduro regime has managed internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through its strict control over the security forces.
- The scale of the socioeconomic collapse and the elevated level of political instability will ensure that the Maduro regime continues to be challenged economically and politically. Low international crude prices, combined with US sanctions on the regime, mean that Venezuela is struggling to place its oil exports abroad. We therefore forecast domestic crude production to average about 400,000 barrels/day in the coming months. Moreover, given that it will lose control of the legislature in 2021, the opposition will be under strong pressure this year to step up its efforts to oust the regime. Mr Maduro will continue to face challenges to maintain the current patronage system and remain in control.
- De facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding. Concurrently, the government has taken measures that have allowed the official exchange rate to float. These measures have so far aided price stability and therefore increase the availability of some basic goods. However, the measures are not a product of economic orthodoxy, but of policy decisions to ensure the regime's survival. We do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that will be required to resolve the economic crisis within the forecast period.

- Venezuela is ranked 82nd of 82 countries in the global business environ-ment rankings for 2020-24, having been in 80th place in the 2015-19 historical period, as the economic crisis deepens despite minor improvements. Reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment are unlikely.

Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: Expansion of interventionist measures, including price controls. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and continue to undermine free competition.
2022-24: Contract rights remain weak, and red tape and ad hoc interventionism continue.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Most attempts to attract investment prove unsuccessful, owing to political and economic instability.
2022-24: Actual investment flows remain low amid ongoing economic volatility. Intellectual property protection and private property rights deteriorate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: Currency controls are weakened, but access to foreign currency remains limited.
2022-24: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, and de facto dollarisation advances. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves as oil prices rise, albeit slowly.
Taxes 2020-21: Risk of further unrest and political instability reduces probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major rise in public spending.
2022-24: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2020-21: Inflation remains high and concerns surrounding economic instability restrict financing to only short-term.
2022-24: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2020-21: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Past emigration of skilled labour aggravates skills shortages.
2022-24: Labour-market rigidities persist, despite some increase in flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2020-21: Underinvestment in water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts.
2022-24: Investors remain highly cautious of committing to long-term capital projects. Infrastructure deteriorates even further.
Technological readiness 2020-21: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment, but with little interest.
2022-24: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to restrict internet and mobile coverage.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013 proved unsuccessful. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his own popularity plummet as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices, combined with strict sanctions on trade from the US, has plunged the country into a severe economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly (AN). In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature to be in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017, a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the AN.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country) has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports, and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$20.9bn in 2018 as the destruction of domestic supply led to increasing import dependence. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates the 2018 current-account surplus to be 3.6% of GDP.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit considers that the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak and diminished oil rents-resulting from existing US sanctions and low international oil prices-present hefty challenges for the survival of the military regime led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV). Owing to the bleak state of its healthcare system, Venezuela faces an uphill battle against the coronavirus, and there is a high risk that the ongoing socioeconomic crisis could evolve into a humanitarian calamity. The govern-ment's mandatory social distancing measures will be a source of unrest-as many workers simply lack the savings they need to survive without continuing to work-as will Mr Maduro's decision to remove some petrol subsidies in the face of fuel shortages.
Despite these compounding social and economic shocks, we expect Mr Maduro to retain power throughout 2020, ruling over what is becoming a much less populous and much poorer country. Mr Maduro has two main factors in his favour. First, the opposition led by the head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, has lost the momentum that it held in 2019. Secondly, the regime retains strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces. Although the risks to our forecasts are very high, we assume that this control-together with the complexity of the security apparatus and the recurrent purges within it-will allow the regime to manage internal dissent.
Mr Maduro' recent actions show that he has the upper hand against the opposition. The new electoral council, inaugurated on June 12th, was packed with Mr Maduro's allies, while opposition members loyal to the regime were appointed as heads of two major opposition parties-Primero Justicia and Voluntad Popular. These actions set the stage for rigged parliamentary elections in December as opposition forces are now effectively disabled. The brazenness of these actions show that Mr Maduro is unperturbed by potential retaliation by the opposition and that political pressure against him is wavering.
Although it is not part of our baseline forecast, we recognise that there is a high risk of some sort of political transition. There are three main paths to this: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We assess the prospect of military action by the US or Colombia as low, and we consider that a negotiated transition would also be difficult. In early March the US outlined a transition framework in which both Mr Maduro and Mr Guaidó would allow a new state council to be created and fresh elections to be held. However, the appointment of Maduro loyalists to the new electoral council demonstrated that this proposal has failed, as trust issues between the two sides are insurmountable.
We believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The regime's main weakness is the fragility of its internal finances. Its patronage system is crucial for sustaining its security apparatus and resisting social unrest. Low international crude prices, US sanctions and the dampening effect of a global recession on workers' remittances will shrink US dollar inflows further. The regime will continue to benefit from funds from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities, but a lack of hard currency could prove fatal to the patronage system and will test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks. The regime's liquidity problems, and a rapidly worsening socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis, could prompt putsch attempts in the near term.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch Legislative elections will take place on December 6th, assuming that Mr Maduro clings to power and that the polls are not cancelled (Mr Maduro has hinted that they could be suspended owing to the coronavirus pandemic). These elections would be neither free nor fair, and the opposition would lose control of the National Assembly. If the opposition were to secure some sort of political change in 2020, the interim government would pursue deep-seated reforms to the electoral authority and attempt to hold a vote within 12 months of its formation, although achieving this would be a major challenge.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations Mr Guaidó has marshalled strong support from the international community, but efforts by most governments in Latin America to support him have reached an impasse. Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, the US, has instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions-most recently placing severe restrict-ions on the Venezuelan operations of Chevron (a US oil company)-and has openly called for the Venezuelan military to accept Mr Guaidó in place of Mr Maduro. The US expects sanctions to put enough pressure on the regime's finances (and therefore on its patronage system) to force Mr Maduro to hold free and fair elections. The US also warned of additional sanctions in the near future. The US administration will remain hawkish in its approach to foreign policy, but we believe that a military intervention is unlikely, given the aversion of the US president, Donald Trump, to such adventurism. If tensions rise and political violence increases, the possibility of smaller-scale interventions cannot be discounted. Looking ahead, regardless of whether Mr Trump or his opponent, Joe Biden of the Democratic Party, wins the US election (our baseline forecast is for a Biden victory), we expect US sanctions to remain in place owing to strong bipartisan support. That said, efforts to reach a negotiated exit for Mr Maduro would increase under a Biden administration.
Mr Maduro's main global backers are Cuba, Russia, China and-more recently-Iran. Russia is helping Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA, the Venezuelan state-owned oil company) to circumvent US sanctions; in March the Venezuelan assets of Rosneft (a Russian energy firm) were transferred directly to Russia, representing a step-up in the US-Russia diplomatic crossfire over Venezuela. Nevertheless, Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the financing-amounting to tens of billions of US dollars per year-required to stabilise the economy and secure PDVSA's long-term future. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries, but has had little success in securing finance for investment. If a transition from the regime were to come about, we believe that Russia and China would be willing to work with Mr Maduro's successor to protect their current investments. Iran recently sent 1.5m barrels of petrol to Venezuela in exchange for gold shipments and is helping to fix the Paraguaná oil refinery.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends The Maduro regime will focus on weathering the fuel shortages and containing the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Despite community spread and an accelerating number of Covid-19 cases, Mr Maduro has eased nationwide quarantine measures to some degree. A "7/7" system is currently in place, whereby seven days of more flexible social distancing measures are followed by seven of tighter restrictions. Measures will remain in place over the short to medium term, as Venezuela's health system is simply unprepared to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. The country's medical infrastructure is poor and hospitals face significant shortages of water, soap, medicines and electricity.
Given the risk that fuel shortages pose to the regime, Mr Maduro has taken some steps to alleviate fuel scarcity. On May 31st the regime announced a two-tiered petrol distribution system. Drivers will be subject to a monthly quota of subsidised petrol. When this has been reached, petrol will be available at internationally indexed prices. The regime will also designate 200 fuel stations across Venezuela, which will be operated by independent or private companies, with petrol in these stations costing a fixed US$0.50/litre. These measures seek to regularise black-market activity so that the regime (rather than a third party) benefits from the gains. Nonetheless, this will only work to an extent, as arbitrage opportunities are still possible under the new subsidy system.
Based on our view that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout our 2020-24 forecast period, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that are required to resolve the economic crisis. De facto dollarisation is expanding; although this was not a tacit goal for the regime, Mr Maduro now welcomes it. Other under-the-radar adjustments are possible in the coming years, as long as these benefit the regime's survival. Such efforts alone are unlikely to bring about economic stability, owing to the absence of a comprehensive microeconomic reform or improvements in the rule of law, and policy predictability will not be forthcoming under the current regime.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy The authorities have not published complete data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect the non-financial public-sector deficit to narrow in 2020, and the public debt/GDP ratio to remain high in the coming years. The sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will curb govern-ment spending. The regime relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Money printing will continue to finance the government's deficits in 2020-24. However, in the medium term, growing remittance inflows will partly offset the need to monetise budget deficits. We currently assume no debt restructuring in 2020-24. Venezuela's weak fiscal position is complicated by the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing-mainly PDVSA-issued debt and development funds from China-that understates the true size of total public liabilities.
All of the sovereign's outstanding global bonds are in arrears. However, bond-holders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy shifts or a change in government. The key PDVSA 2020 bond, which was secured using 50.1% of the shares of Citgo (PDVSA's US subsidiary) as collateral, fell due at end-October 2019 and was not paid. A US court ruled that PDVSA is an "alter ego" of the Venezuelan government; this will have far-reaching implications, as some international firms are seeking to seize shares of Citgo stock. However, the US considers Citgo to be under the purview of Mr Guaidó, thus currently shielding Citgo assets from seizure by creditors.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy The government's financing needs will force the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) to ramp up money printing in the short term. Growing dollarisation and a strong contraction in domestic demand slowed hyper-inflationary pressures in 2019. However, we expect hyperinflation to return in the coming months, owing to monetisation of large fiscal deficits and severe goods shortages.
Overall, hyperinflation will continue until its underlying causes are addressed. Hyperinflation has quickened the pace of dollarisation of the economy (more than 50% of transactions are now thought to be conducted in US dollars). We believe that Venezuela is heading towards overall de facto dollarisation. Monthly inflation will rise again in the short term and will remain substantial. However, given the effect of dollarisation on price stability, we do not expect a return to the extremely high annual inflation rates of more than 1,000,000% experienced in 2018.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 36.2% in 2019 (and cumulative contraction of almost 70% since 2013), we expect an additional decline of 30.3% in 2020. The contraction reflects plummeting oil exports and the adverse effects of the government's quarantine measures, which will further dent domestic demand. Fuel scarcity will also hit the non-oil economy indirectly, through a scarcity of inputs and hyperinflation. From a demand-side perspective, the GDP contraction will be driven by falling real incomes and continued mass emigration (which is fuelled by unemployment, violence and social instability).
Low crude prices and weak oil exports will put significant pressure on the country to slash crude production. Venezuela's average break-even price is about US$15-20/barrel. US sanctions on the regime raise the risks involved in dealing with Venezuela, forcing the country to offer a hefty discount on its crude. This means that, at current market prices, Venezuela is making only a limited profit (its oil basket traded at an estimated US$25/b by end-July). The current circumstances have inevitably led to production cuts; oil output fell to 393,000 barrels/day (b/d) in June, according to OPEC, from 870,000 b/d in June 2019 and 1.3m b/d in the same month in 2018. We believe that output will average about 400,000 b/d over the coming months.
In 2021 we expect the economy to stabilise somewhat (contract marginally), owing to a stabilisation of domestic demand as social distancing measures are lifted. In 2022 economic growth will return on the back of a surge in oil prices. Despite serious operational problems (such as difficulties in obtaining equip-ment for repairs or finding qualified staff) and a limited pool of suitable buyers of Venezuelan crude, oil output will recover somewhat in the medium term as producers become more accustomed to the new post-sanctions export markets. Furthermore, relative macroeconomic stability will allow the non-oil economy to recover marginally in the medium term. There are substantial risks to our forecasts, which assume that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout 2020-24. In the event of a transition, there would be upside risks to our medium-term baseline; the degree of improvement would depend on the characteristics of the transition and on the new government's macroeconomic programme.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation Severely reduced domestic supply, constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits will continue to stoke hyperinflation this year. Dollarisation and the regime's heavy restrictions on credit helped to subdue hyperinflation in the second half of 2019. Nevertheless, consumer prices rose by 19.5% month on month in June-the second weakest monthly increment in more than a year. This deceleration owes to subsiding effects of social distancing measures on demand-side inflationary pressures. However, as the economy reopens inflationary pressures will strengthen, owing to fuel scarcity, price controls and the ramping up of government money printing.
In the medium term, inflation will remain high for as long as the Maduro regime is in power, given huge fundamental imbalances between supply and demand, and the need for the regime to monetise its fiscal deficits. Weather-related shocks are a perennial risk to the inflation outlook.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates Hyperinflation will sustain bolívar depreciation in 2020. Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency denomination (as in March 2018) or a new currency is a strong possibility, although the exact nature of such a move is hard to forecast. In mid-2019 the regime announced a loosening of currency controls. Although this was a positive move, significant barriers limit access to US dollars via formal means. We still believe that the government will maintain a number of indirect controls on the foreign-exchange market. In this environment, a black-market exchange-rate premium is inevitable. On July 30th the official exchange rate was BsS258,000:US$1, compared with a black-market rate of BsS268,000:US$1. The premium (currently 4%) is small by historical comparison.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector Venezuela will post a small current-account deficit of 2% of GDP in 2020, owing to lower oil exports and limited remittance inflows resulting from the global recession. The BCV's official figures for 2017-18 show that Venezuela posted current-account surpluses in this period. In 2019 the collapse of goods export earnings (owing to US sanctions on the oil trade) hit the trade balance hard. Nevertheless, based on the latest data, we estimate that the current account remained in surplus owing to growing inflows of workers' remittances and the non-payment of interest on bonded debt (saving in excess of US$5bn in 2019).
We expect the current account to return to surplus in the medium term, averaging 4.6% of GDP in 2022-24. Goods exports will recover as international oil prices increase and the country steps up trade with Asian markets. This recovery will be supported by continued weakness in domestic demand, rising remittances from abroad and the fact that the sovereign will remain in default throughout the forecast period.

Full text: - The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the current government to serve out its second term, which will expire in 2024. We expect the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to run a highly centralised administration and to make some progress on pushing through structural reforms.
- A deadly clash between Indian and Chinese troops in a disputed border region in June 2020 will cause a deterioration in diplomatic and economic ties, but we do not forecast large-scale military clashes. The incident will cause India to seek warmer relations with the US and its allies. Bilateral relations with Pakistan will also remain strained, but we do not expect outright hostilities.
- As a result of economic pressure, we expect the government to continue to unwind gradually the lockdown measures introduced in March. The ongoing spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) may overwhelm India's healthcare system.
- The budget deficit will widen to 7.8% of GDP in fiscal year 2020/21 (April-March) as the government falls short on revenue and launches stimulus to keep households and firms afloat during the lockdown. The deficit will narrow but nevertheless remain wide during the remainder of the forecast period.
- We expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) to cut interest rates by another 100 basis points in the remainder of 2020: its main policy rate will be cut to 3%. The RBI will also tweak its policy tools and regulatory framework to facilitate the transmission of accommodative monetary policy.
- Real GDP will contract by 5.8% in 2020/21. While the recovery in 2021/22 will be sluggish on a sequential basis, we expect the economy to grow by 8%, owing primarily to a low base of comparison.
- The rupee is forecast to depreciate against the US dollar in 2020, averaging Rs74.7:US$1 as global investors flee to safe-haven markets. It will strengthen slightly in 2021 before depreciating again for the rest of the forecast period.
- The trade deficit will narrow in 2020 amid a slump in global oil prices. It will widen from 2021 as India increases imports of capital goods. Business outsourcing and information technology will remain the key service export sectors in 2020-24.

Country forecast overview: India's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: The government takes steps towards partial privatisation of some state-owned companies in 2021.
2022-24: The government continues to rationalise liquidation and bankruptcy laws to simplify the closure of insolvent businesses or merger and acquisition activity involving other corporate entities.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: The government liberalises foreign direct investment (FDI) policy in several sectors, as it also encourages the use of locally made products. Investment from China will be heavily scrutinised.
2022-24: Foreign investment in export manufacturing increases markedly, albeit in only a few regions.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: India remains reluctant to join major regional trade deals and pivots towards protectionism by raising tariffs.
2022-24: Full capital-account convertibility remains off the policy agenda.
Taxes 2020-21: The government provides only marginal tax rebates and breaks to businesses and individuals affected by the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak.
2022-24: Alcohol and petroleum products remain outside the scope of the goods and services tax.
Financing 2020-21: The Reserve Bank of India (the central bank) relaxes regulatory norms for debt-laden banks and non-bank financial companies, raising risks in order to incentivise lending and support economic growth.
2022-24: Private-sector banks account for a rising share of total lending, while bad debt issues persist in public-sector banks. Major consolidation and privatisations within the public-sector banks will continue.
The labour market 2020-21: Unemployment soars because of the lockdown; the government expands the national employment guarantee scheme. Labour laws are liberalised temporarily in some provinces through state-level ordinances.
2022-24: Some state-level liberalisation of labour laws is made permanent through legislation by the central government.
Infrastructure 2020-21: The government increases its budgetary allocation for infrastructure spending to support the economy through the coronavirus crisis.
2022-24: The construction of a high-speed rail link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad continues, but the project misses its targeted completion date of August 2022.
Technological readiness 2020-21: Most technological innovation continues to be concentrated in a few clusters, such as Bangalore and Hyderabad. Expenditure on research and development as a proportion of GDP remains low by international standards.
2022-24: The government makes efforts to digitise the delivery of public services, in an effort to cut corruption and promote the efficiency of "last-mile delivery" for such services.

Background: India gained independence in 1947 after two centuries of British colonial rule. Partition at the same time created the state of Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars (two of them over the disputed territory of Kashmir). India is the second-most populous country in the world, with an estimated 1.37bn people in 2019, according to the UN. Its economy was the third-largest in the world in 2019 (measured in nominal US dollars at purchasing power parity exchange rates).
Political structure: India has been a democracy since independence. At federal level, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) holds a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), although it governs in a broader coalition, the National Democratic Alliance. India follows the UK model of parliamentary government, with a prime minister as head of government. It has a president as the head of state. The country has a quasi-federal structure, with state governments having their own legislatures and enjoying a fair degree of freedom.
Policy issues: We expect the ruling BJP to undertake policy reforms once the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic passes. The government has already announced measures to privatise or merge public-sector units in many industries to promote competition. The government will also make modest progress on the liberalisation of regulatory requirements and foreign investment. However, the primary focus of the government will be on structural reform, particularly the contentious labour and land laws. We expect only incremental progress on these issues. The current administration has made headway in speeding up infrastructure projects, and this will also remain a priority in the next five years.
Taxation: The government will maintain efforts to broaden the tax base in 2020-24, including by further digitising tax departments. This, coupled with strong economic growth, will support a pick-up in tax collection. Despite some reforms, including the introduction of a nationwide goods and services tax in 2017, India's tax system will remain highly complex.
Foreign trade: India's merchandise trade deficit narrowed to US$157.7bn in 2019, from US$186.7bn in 2018, while the surplus on the country's services account rose from US$80.8bn to US$84.2bn in the same period.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the majority of seats in the election for the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) that took place in April-May 2019. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the central government to remain in power for its full term, which ends in 2024. The results of the 2019 election were a testament to the popularity of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, who will remain the dominant figure in the government. Decision-making will remain centralised among the prime minister's office (PMO) and key ministers.
In late March the government began to implement what have been among the most stringent lockdown measures around the world, designed to stem the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19). These measures were initially welcomed by the public as an effective method of halting the spread of the virus. However, the unabated spread of the epidemic and the extensive economic damage caused by the restrictions highlight the risk of social unrest. High levels of unemployment and the government's inability to provide income support will challenge the administration. We expect the government's reform agenda, especially the liberalisation of labour laws, to be another source of tension. Nevertheless, we do not expect these developments to unseat the government; this is because of the formidable support it enjoys from a large part of the citizenry and the lack of a strong opposition.
Over the medium term, protests by religious groups and communal clashes will pose a threat to political stability. Large-scale protests tied to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) were only cut short by social distancing measures introduced to slow the spread of the virus. In contrast to the country's current secular constitution, several far-right groups, including some affiliated with the BJP, have long been pushing for India to be recast as a Hindu nation-a view that puts them at odds with minority groups in the country, notably Muslims. The risk of social instability is high in the latter part of the forecast period, particularly in the two-year period prior to the 2024 general election, if the ruling party moves ahead with its Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) agenda.
The security situation in the state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) will remain a central concern throughout the forecast period. We expect security risks in the area to remain high. Any attempt by protesters to destabilise the region is likely to face a heavy-handed response from the government, including the use of internet shutdowns, curfews and riot-control forces. The government's move has also increased the risk of terrorist attack by separatist forces in major Indian cities such as Delhi and Mumbai. A deadly border clash with Chinese troops in June 2020 will also affect political stability. Vocal domestic demands for a strong response pose political risks for Mr Modi, who will be reluctant to risk military escalation.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch The next general election is expected to be held around May 2024. The focus before then will be the state assembly elections. The results of recent state elections suggest that voters treat state and national elections differently, and that local issues tend to be more important in the former. We expect the BJP coalition to gain power in the upcoming Bihar election, to be held in late 2020, but only with the help of its coalition partner in the state.
In the Rajya Sabha (the upper house), the BJP and its allies form the largest grouping, although they command fewer than half of the seats. Assuming that the BJP retains control of key state assemblies and wins control of more in the next few years, the party and its allies within the larger National Democratic Alliance (NDA) will secure a simple majority in the upper house from end-2020. This will enable the alliance to pass legislation without opposition approval. However, it will struggle to win the two-thirds majority needed to make constitutional changes unchallenged.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations Tensions with Pakistan have persisted amid the dispute over J&K. We expect relations to remain strained, but do not anticipate a complete breakdown of diplomatic ties. We believe that Pakistan's military will increase its support for militant groups in Indian-controlled Kashmir. This will raise the risk of terrorist attacks by non-state actors. Although small-scale military exchanges between the two countries are likely to occur in 2020-24, the nuclear arsenal of the two countries will act as a powerful deterrent against full-scale conflict.
A deadly border clash between China and India in June has led to a substantial deterioration in bilateral relations. India has taken steps to retaliate economically against China, such as toughening the approval process for Chinese investments and increasing tariff and non-tariff barriers on Chinese exports to India. Economic retaliation by China will focus primarily on tit-for-tat tariff increases rather than more detrimental export restrictions that could disrupt supply chains for Indian firms. We also expect further skirmishes tied to infrastructure development in border regions disputed by the two countries. However, large-scale military clashes are not within our core forecast.
Souring ties with China will encourage India to improve relations with the US, Japan and Australia, among other countries. India's foreign policy within South Asia will also focus on countering increasing Chinese influence in Nepal and Sri Lanka. India's relations with Bangladesh will remain cordial.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends The government's majority will give it considerable flexibility in determining the economic policy agenda. Its key near-term priority is to contain the coronavirus outbreak, to which India is particularly vulnerable, given its large population and weak healthcare infrastructure. The widespread and stringent lockdown measures imposed from March were only partially successful in reducing the spread of the virus, which has accelerated since such measures were relaxed gradually from May. Despite the spread of the virus, we believe that the government will continue to take steps towards reopening the economy, adopting localised quarantine policies where necessary.
We expect the government to take up policy reforms after the crisis as it looks to support growth. The government plans to open up more sectors of the economy to private firms, by privatising or reducing the number of public-sector units. The government will undertake piecemeal changes to legislation, such as a relaxation of regulatory requirements and a modest liberalisation of foreign direct investment (FDI) rules. In terms of improving the business environment, one area of attention will be the liberalisation of contentious labour and land laws. Progress on this will be limited and the benefits will only be seen in the latter part of the forecast period.
The lockdown will amplify the mounting non-performing loan (NPL) issue in the banking sector. Slow progress will be made towards policy changes to improve the health of the sector. Infrastructure projects-particularly pet projects of the Modi government, such as the National Infrastructure Pipeline-remain a priority, in response to the rapid pace of urbanisation and to boost the business environment. However, we expect a revival in infrastructure spending only from the fourth quarter of 2020, once the coronavirus outbreak is brought more under control.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy The coronavirus outbreak will force the government to rewrite its approved budget for 2020/21, which was conservatively expansionary. It will suspend the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act temporarily to allow for more flexibility in supporting the economy. The lockdown has prompted an unbudgeted increase in social spending programmes, especially the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, as well as an extension of existing financial support schemes for businesses.
The government has announced an Rs20trn package (equivalent to around 10% of GDP) to support the economy. However, this headline figure includes liquidity measures provided by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) and advances by banks under the government's measures. The actual amount of additional budgetary spending announced equates to around 1.4% of GDP. We expect the government to announce another fiscal package, worth 1-1.5% of GDP, in the third quarter of 2020, including an infrastructure development programme. In view of a fall in revenue and lower nominal GDP, the budget deficit is forecast to widen to the equivalent of 7.8% of GDP in 2020/21.
As the economy recovers, the government will look to consolidate the public finances gradually. This will narrow the budget deficit to the equivalent of 6.7% of GDP in 2021/22. The authorities will look to deepen the tax base and increase low levels of tax compliance. However, the need to support welfare payments and infrastructure spending will maintain upward pressure on fiscal expenditure. We also expect subsidies to remain in place for labour-intensive, small-scale businesses-particularly those that are export-focused.
This federal fiscal picture does not reflect the true level of the deficit. The deficits of many states and part of the expenditure of public-sector units represent implicit liabilities for the central government.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy The coronavirus epidemic will prompt further monetary-policy loosening by the RBI. The central bank has lowered its policy repo rate by 115 basis points to 4% since March, while also widening the monetary-policy corridor by lowering the reverse repo rate (the "floor" of the corridor) by 155 basis points, to 3.35%. With inflationary pressure expected to moderate and economic growth under strong downward pressure, we expect a further 100-basis-point reduction in the policy repo rate over the remainder of 2020. We also expect the adoption of unconventional policy instruments, including long-term repo operations to lend to banks, which will include further long-term refinancing operations.
Monetary policy will aim to support businesses as the coronavirus pandemic suppresses household spending and business investment. However, the outcome may be far from satisfactory, as monetary policy transmission is not smooth. While banking-sector lending to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises will improve, as the government has provided a sovereign guarantee for those loans, banks will be reluctant to lend to other parts of the economy, given increased risk. The level of non-performing assets in the financial sector is alarming, and the coronavirus outbreak will only exacerbate the issue, with more firms forced out of business. Policy support from the central bank and the government will be needed to support the recovery of the banking sector once the pandemic passes.
The RBI has maintained inflation-targeting as the cornerstone of its monetary policy framework. It seeks to contain consumer price inflation within a 2-6% range, and close to a target of 4%. However, strong political pressure on the RBI-which has forced out two hawkish heads of the bank under BJP rule-has complicated the achievement of these objectives.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth We expect real GDP to contract by 5.8% in 2020/21-the sharpest contraction in economic activity since India's independence in 1947. The headline GDP number will be pulled down primarily by an 18.1% year-on-year economic contraction in the first quarter of 2020/21, reflecting India's stringent lockdown measures. The economy will continue to contract on an annual basis in the second and third quarters of 2020/21, as job losses and business closures depress activity. Sectors such as travel, hospitality and tourism will be the most affected.
On a GDP expenditure basis, we expect private consumption to contract sharply in 2020/21, as people's economic activities are constrained during lockdown and as consumption remains low even after the restrictions are lifted. Investment spending is also expected to decline steeply as firms postpone activity amid high uncertainty around the virus. We also expect increased loan liabilities to be taken up by corporates and banks to further discourage new investment. We maintain our view that the government will continue to bolster the economy through increased expenditure, but the effect will be limited. We expect exports to fall as a global recession sets in.
Real GDP growth is expected to rebound sharply in 2021/22, but the headline forecast of 8% is exaggerated by an extremely low base of comparison in 2020/21. Economic growth in 2022/23-2024/25 will average 5.9% a year. Incremental progress on structural reform will provide support for growth in the latter part of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation We expect consumer prices to increase by an average of 3.4% in 2020 as a whole. While food price inflation has remained elevated during the lockdown, we expect it to moderate once supply-side constraints ease. Furthermore, a collapse in non-food demand will lead the fall in the headline number. Inflation will be pushed down further in the second half of the year by a higher base of comparison in 2019. Our forecast assumes a normal monsoon this year (and in every year of the outlook period).
The RBI will keep its policy rate unchanged in 2021 to bolster the recovery, which will lead to stronger inflation. The adoption of a tighter monetary policy stance in 2022 will offset the inflationary impact of strengthening oil prices. The central bank will accord higher priority to containing inflationary pressures towards the end of the forecast period; consumer price inflation is expected to average 4.4% in 2024.
Low oil prices and reduced domestic demand will generate producer price inflation of just 0.1% in 2020. As prices for oil and other commodities strengthen, producer price inflation will firm to an average of 3.5% in 2021-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates The RBI's adoption of a fairly aggressive loosening stance in 2020, along with a sharp contraction in economic activity, will weigh on the exchange rate. We forecast that the rupee will depreciate by 6.1% on an annual average basis to Rs74.7:US$1 in 2020, as the domestic economic situation worsens.
In 2021 we expect the rupee to appreciate slightly, to an average of Rs73.7:US$1, as foreign investment returns. The rupee will depreciate in 2022-24 amid rising oil prices and a persistent current-account deficit.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector The lower oil price and weaker domestic demand will contribute to a narrowing of India's current-account deficit in 2020, to the equivalent of 0.4% of GDP. Merchandise exports will contract sharply because of disruption caused by the pandemic, but are expected to rebound in 2021 amid a pick-up in global demand.
Increased competition from other countries and changing industrial trends will weigh on the pace of growth in India's main service export sectors, particularly business-process outsourcing and information technology. Nevertheless, the services balance will remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, making a positive contribution to the current account. Owing to the large shortfall on merchandise trade, however, the current account will remain in deficit, averaging -1.2% of GDP in the remainder of the forecast period.
The coronavirus outbreak will also weigh on inward investment in 2020-21. Inward direct investment will recover in the rest of the forecast period, as the expanding economy and growing consumer demand provide opportunities for businesses and the business environment improves under the government's reform agenda.

Full text: - The outbreak of the coronavirus resulted in the imposition of significant restrictions on economic activity and population, generating a recession in 2020, with output contracting by 5.5% for the full year. Fiscal stimulus measures, as well as a substantial decline in oil sector revenue, will generate a looser fiscal stance that will persist throughout the forecast period (2020-24).
- Norway has a history of coalition governments and cross-party consensus, delivering high levels of political stability. The constitution does not allow for the dissolution of parliament. The ruling coalition comprises the Conservatives, the Liberals and the Christian Democrats (KrF) as a minority government, with 61 seats in the 169-seat parliament. The next election is in September 2021, and The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the centre-right bloc to re-enter government, owing to its competent handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
- We expect real GDP to contract by 5.5% in 2020, owing to the fallout from the virus. We do not expect a reimposition of a lockdown even in the event of a revival of infections. The economy will recover from 2021 to 2024, with growth averaging 2.4% as restrictions on trade and mobility gradually recede.
- We estimate that inflation will fall to 0.8% on average in 2020, from 2.2% in 2019, owing to worsening economic conditions, but pressures on core inflation from rising food prices pose an upside risk to price growth. Economic recovery will generate a rebound in inflation throughout the forecast period, generating inflation averaging 1.3% in 2021-24.
- In March Norges Bank (the central bank) reversed much of its monetary tightening, lowering interest rates by a total of 125 basis points, to 0.25%. Core inflation is falling as demand declines, and rates are expected to remain stable until the end of 2020. A steady policy of normalisation will follow, with policy rates reaching 1.5% by 2024.

- Norway's business environment score rises slightly for 2020-24, as the economy has become more resilient following oil industry reforms. Backed by vast oil wealth, the political and economic environments are robust, and financing opportunities should remain firm. Norway lags regional peers owing to limited market opportunities, tight labour market regulation and high wages.

Country forecast overview: Norway's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: Low regulatory burden, but probable rise in already high level of state influence in the economy, following emergency policy measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic and related temporary lockdown.
2022-24: A strategic plan guides the Norwegian Competition Authority to raise sectoral competition and procurement rules.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Generally positive attitude towards attracting foreign direct investment, but capital inflows constrained by weak global economy and new domestic investment screening regime that can block investment on national security grounds.
2022-24: The economy further diversifies investor countries beyond Europe, although to limited effect.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: Absorbing the shock to global trade from the coronavirus will be a major theme, with a discussion around "reshoring" strategic industries away from China likely to follow the immediate crisis.
2022-24: No change in policy towards joining the EU or leaving the European Economic Area (EEA). A reassessment of EEA membership is possible, but unlikely. Efforts to promote bilateral trade deals continue.
Taxes 2020-21: Temporary stimulus measures and easing of tax-payment requirements for firms in response to coronavirus.
2022-24: Government investigates reform of subsidy regime for oil and gas exploration. Expansion of environmental taxes to meet climate change goals.
Financing 2020-21: Significant expansion of central bank liquidity to support functioning of financial markets. Policy interest rates remain at record-low level. Private-sector balance sheets weakened by economic fallout from the crisis.
2022-24: Credit demand likely to remain subdued following the crisis, but opportunities could emerge for growth of non-bank financing channels, including private equity and venture capital. Tighter anti-money-laundering rules.
The labour market 2020-21: The coronavirus shock leads to a substantial reversal in labour market performance.
2022-24: Improvements in employment and wages follow the crisis. Skills shortages remain an issue in some sectors.
Infrastructure 2020-21: Government applies 12-year transport plan (2018-29) and raises funds available for maintenance and construction of infrastructure projects. Gradual roll-out of fifth-generation (5G) mobile services.
2022-24: Investments in new road and rail transport links are made. Digital infrastructure upgrades continue.
Technological developments 2020-21: Implementation of Norway's cyber-defence strategy, after cyber-attacks on national infrastructure.
2022-24: The Open Artificial Intelligence (AI) lab grows in size and importance, underpinning AI preparedness.

Background: The Labour Party governed almost continuously in 1935-65, dominating until 2001, when a minority coalition comprising the Conservatives, the Christian Democrats (KrF) and the Liberals swept to power. In 2005 Labour returned to office in a centre-left coalition with the Socialist Left Party (SV) and the Centre Party-the first majority government in two decades-lasting until 2009. The September 2013 election led to a regime change, with a minority right-of-centre coalition of the Conservatives and the Progress Party (FrP) taking office. The centre-right coalition was re-elected in 2017. The Conservatives and the FrP were joined by the Liberals in January 2018 and by the KrF in January 2019.
Political structure: There is no right of dissolution between elections. Norway uses a modified proportional representation system: 150 out of the 169 members of the unicameral Storting (parliament) are "district mandates" elected by open-list proportional representation. The remaining 19 seats, the "levelling mandates", are distributed only between the parties that get more than 4% of the national vote and whose initial seat count (out of 150) is not proportional to their share of the vote.
Policy issues: The centre-right government will try to implement additional business-friendly policies and tax cuts, focused on further reducing the negative spillover effects of lower oil prices on wider economic activity and on strengthening the mainland economy. Spending from Norway's oil fund is expected to rise, but it will remain comfortably within the country's fiscal guidelines. Despite a cross-party agreement on tackling climate change, tension will persist in the Storting over the balance between industrial development and environmental protection.
Taxation: At the start of 2016 most parties agreed on a multi-year corporation tax reduction (from 27% to 23% by 2018) to improve competitiveness in the economy; it has since been reduced to 22% in 2019. Oil companies pay an additional flat-rate tax of 50% on income derived from the extraction, processing and transport of oil, but benefit from a 78% tax refund on the costs of exploration for oil and gas. The capital-gains tax was cut from 28% to 27% in 2014. The ordinary rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 25%. The top marginal income tax rate is 54.3% (including employers' social security contributions).
Foreign trade: Oil and gas output and prices greatly affect Norway's trade flows. The petroleum industry contributes about half of total goods export revenue. In 2016 the trade account registered its lowest level since 1999, but has been recovering since. The current-account surplus increased to US$16.1bn in 2019, down from US$31.1bn in the previous year. The trade and current-account balance will remain in surplus throughout the forecast period (2020-24).

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The current ruling coalition, comprising the centre-right Conservatives and two small centrist parties-the Liberals and the Christian Democrats (KrF)-is coming to the end of its term in September 2021. The coalition rules as a minority government, with just 61 members in the 169-seat parliament, after the far-right Progress Party (FrP) withdrew from government in January 2020 after a coalition dispute over infrastructure. Given the nearing of the next general election, scheduled for September 2021, and a strong tradition of political consensus, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect a change in government.
Despite the government being a minority in parliament, it is able to pass legislation with the backing of the FrP (which has pledged to support it in significant parliamentary votes). The ruling coalition can also rely on the support of other opposition parties (such as the centre-left Labour Party). Although the FrP will probably withdraw its support for the government on some matters (preventing the proposal of some legislation), the damage to political stability would be low, as the constitution prohibits a pre-term dissolution of parliament, and therefore a snap election.
In the near term the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has strengthened the stabilising influences on the political outlook. The government has mostly unwound its restrictions on social interaction, after being among the first group of European countries to experience a outbreak of the disease. Public support for the ruling parties has strengthened markedly during the crisis, and political support for the lockdown was wide-ranging. Despite the economic disruption caused by the lockdown, there has been no increase in support for populist parties in Norway. Populist movements have historically had limited electoral appeal in the country, as the far-right FrP takes a largely pragmatic approach to government, in contrast with other European populist movements. Their presence has only a marginal impact on political stability, as the domestic political culture is highly consensus-driven, with frequent collaboration between the government and opposition parties on a range of issues.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch The next general election will be held in September 2021. The Storting cannot be dissolved before completing a full four-year term, meaning that there is no risk of a snap election. A change in government is also not part of our forecast.
Although the handling of the coronavirus crisis is likely to shape political preferences in the run-up to the election, it is unclear how much of an effect it will have by September 2021. The governing bloc of right-wing parties (excluding the FrP) have seen their popular support increase in the wake of the pandemic, a feature common to most countries. We expect the government's competent handling of the coronavirus crisis to place the right-wing bloc in a good position before the election in 2021, although the decline in support for the FrP since 2017 means they may not be able to produce a stable majority.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations EU relations will remain a significant foreign policy issue, and may steadily encroach on domestic politics as environmental affairs become increasingly prominent. As a member of the European Economic Area, Norway has access to the single market (in exchange for contributions to the EU budget), but must accept relevant EU regulations while having limited influence over them. This has historically been accepted as a substitute for outright EU membership (which has been rejected twice in national referendums in 1972 and 1994), but mounting concern over economic diversification and a reduction in carbon emissions has pushed environmentalist parties (the Greens and the Liberals) to support outright EU membership. Although we do not expect Norway to join the EU without a national referendum, political pressure for a third plebiscite on the matter may grow in tandem with environmentalist influence in the government.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends Having passed the first stages of the pandemic ahead of neighbouring countries, the government's chief policy objective has been to steadily unwind the controls imposed in early March. Government policy has followed the broad European pattern, with enforced closures of schools, businesses and public events, alongside restrictions on movement (specifically from urban to rural areas).
As one of the European countries to act the earliest, Norway was also among the first to exit controls when it did so on June 15th. Restrictions on economic activity have been mostly withdrawn, with bars, gyms and restaurants allowed to fully reopen (under some social distancing measures) and all public events under 200 people are permitted. Internationally, controls on cross-border movement between other Nordic states (except Sweden) have been fully lifted, and restrictions on travel from EU states have been substantially reduced. Although the policy response in a renewed outbreak remains uncertain, early indications are that a renewed nationwide lockdown is unlikely, as the associated economic costs would be too great.
Nevertheless, a revival in infections as controls are lifted remains a substantial risk to our economic forecast in 2020-21 and will probably generate another contraction in activity, as fear of infection will supress demand. Countervailing this, a rise in infections is likely to be met with a more robust public response. Although the lockdown has proved economically costly, it has given time for improvements in the capacity of the healthcare system and in a trace and quarantine system that will reduce the spread of the virus even without a vaccine.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy Like other European countries, Norway has announced fiscal stimulus in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, although this is much smaller than in peer economies. Total discretionary stimulus has amounted to about Nkr160bn (US$16bn), or about 5.5% of mainland GDP. The budget that the government presented in October 2019 has been abandoned as the disruption from the coronavirus generates a dual shock to both the mainland and oil sectors. The government's new budget, presented in mid-May, targets a substantial with-drawal from the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG; 4.2% of its value) to fund further expenditure, in breach of the government's fiscal rule to not withdraw more than 3% of the fund's value in any year. We expect that the government will have to lean on the fund for further fiscal support in the coming years, but this will not diminish its vast size. For the first time since 1993, this will not be enough to prevent a deficit in 2020, which we forecast at just 0.9% of GDP.
Existing government support for the labour market is similar to the measures implemented in response to the coronavirus in neighbouring countries. Under the system of permittering, the government temporarily pays a large portion (more than 60%) of the wages of workers who are placed on furlough. Expanded take-up of this scheme, although it will preserve much of the existing labour market for the duration of the pandemic, will leave the government liable for a significant increase in spending.
On the employer side, fiscal support has expanded rapidly. The government has deferred tax payments and purchased corporate bonds on the secondary market, reducing borrowing costs for businesses. About Nkr20bn has been set aside as a crisis fund to cover fixed costs for businesses during the coronavirus pandemic, modelled on the Danish fund set up for this purpose.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy In response to the substantial disruption caused by the pandemic, Norges Bank (the central bank) has lowered the policy rate by 150 basis points since February, to 0%-the lowest rate in modern history. This unprecedented mone-tary easing was completed over three meetings of the monetary policy committee. The central bank also lowered countercyclical capital buffers for major banks from 2.5% to 1% to ensure bank solvency and expand credit growth.
We expect Norges Bank to maintain its highly accommodative policy until the end of 2021, given the lingering uncertainty around the evolution of the pandemic, which will continue to weigh on business and consumer confidence. There are likely to be substantial scarring effects on both output and employment from the virus, with major risks to Norway's oil sector, with looser monetary policy required to accelerate the recovery in the near term. Looking ahead, Norges Bank targets inflation of "close to 2% over time", and the policy rate should rise steadily after 2021 when economic conditions improve. The steady rise in oil prices, the gradual recovery of the domestic economy and the revival in global trade should all generate a steady normalisation of interest rates over the forecast period.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth Despite the shift in policy towards a steady easing of lockdown restrictions, the gradual pace of withdrawal throughout the second quarter of 2020 will guarantee a contraction in the second quarter of the year, after an initial decline of 1.6% in the first quarter. With most forms of the lockdown extending from March 12th to June 15th we judge that the bulk of the decline will take place in the second quarter, as 11 of the 14 weeks of restrictions took place in that time. The economy will rebound only in the latter half of 2020 as control measures subside and economic activity improves, bringing full-year output down by 5.5% from 2019. There remains a high risk that the rate of viral infection will increase as the social distancing measures are withdrawn, prompting a reimposition of controls later in the year. We judge that long-term scarring from the crisis will be significant, but modest compared with peer economies, as government support for short-term disruption to the labour market will remain substantial.
The coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent lockdown will primarily affect consumer spending and export demand in Norway, which we expect to decline by 6.9% and 11.8% respectively. On the consumption side, the imposition of social-distancing measures damages consumer spending both directly, through the prevention of consumer activities such as services spending, and indirectly, through a decline in total employment and consumer spending power. On the external side, similar lockdowns among major trading partners (namely the UK and Germany) will weigh on demand for major exports, such as energy goods and shipping.
The export-oriented oil and gas sector will be especially damaged by the outbreak. Demand for both gas and oil globally is strongly pro-cyclical and Norway's entrenched exposure to markets in Europe (the region worst hit by the crisis) implies a substantial contraction in real exports this year. Although firms within Norway's oil sector (especially Equinor, the state-backed oil firm) are in good shape, real exports and the outlook for investment in the sector have worsened significantly.
Investment in both the oil and non-oil sectors will also weaken, as uncertainty around a possible recurrence of the virus (at least until a vaccine is produced) will chill investor appetite for risk, and cuts in oil sector production will weigh on the returns of offshore projects. Growth will recover more substantially from 2021 onwards as economic life returns to normal and the risk of a reimposition of controls steadily abates. However, the prospect of lasting damage to household balance sheets (with household debt at 110% of GDP in December 2019), business confidence and oil investment will keep real GDP below pre-crisis levels until 2023.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation The inflationary effects from the coronavirus lockdown have been broadly negative, with the collapse in energy prices and demand for non-essential goods pulling down price growth . Headline inflation initially fell from 1.8% in January to 0.7% in March, before rising to 1.3% in May. Nevertheless, now that restrictions are being lifted, inflation has started to pick up pace again. Rising core inflation, owing to a depreciating currency and a rise in food price inflation, to over 3% in May, will erode consumer purchasing power.
Looking ahead, we expect that the disruptive effects of the coronavirus on consumer demand and oil prices will drag down inflation in 2020, to an average of 0.8%. This trend will be supported by an easing in household stockpiling as controls on social distancing abate, and as the fall in oil prices (which we expect to average US$40/barrel this year) ripples through the economy. The downward movement in the krone and a stronger than expected recovery in consumer spending continue to pose upside risks for inflation.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates The krone has largely matched the substantial changes in global energy markets since January. Between end-2019 and end-June, it depreciated by roughly 8% on a trade-weighted basis, as the price of oil has collapsed from US$65/b to US$39/b and economic activity has slowed.
Although the krone has strengthened from its nadir in March (when it had depreciated by over 17% since December), conditions of subdued demand and slower growth are likely to prevent the krone from fully returning to its December value until 2024, when oil prices have recovered, and production is restored. Further downward shocks to oil prices, chiefly from shocks to global demand, remain a risk to our exchange-rate forecast.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector Norway's current-account surpluses are structurally supported by large inflows on the trade and primary income accounts, respectively reflecting the economy's position as a major oil exporter and the size of the GPFG.
Although inflows in both of these components will be damaged by the economic fallout from the coronavirus, we do not expect either of these accounts to fall into deficit. Oil exports will be damaged by the proposed cuts to production, but we expect that this will be balanced by the reduction in goods imports, keeping the trade balance in surplus despite the fall in oil prices.
As the coronavirus abates, steady rises in oil prices from 2021 onwards will further support the trade balance, and increases in production (barring any government intervention) will continue throughout the forecast period. We expect that this, combined with a revival of growth in major trading partners (particularly the UK and Germany), will support a rise in the current-account surplus over the forecast period, to 5.3% of GDP in 2024.

Full text: - Despite Venezuela's socioeconomic collapse and a public health crisis triggered by the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19), The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that the civic-military regime led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela will retain power throughout the 2020-24 forecast period. Mr Maduro's position will be supported primarily by his grip over a complex security apparatus and the opposition's lack of de facto power. On this basis, we expect continued deterioration of the economy, sustained outward migration, and a poorer and more violent Venezuela. Despite US sanctions (and their impact on oil production), the Maduro regime has managed internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through its strict control over the security forces.
- The scale of the socioeconomic collapse and the elevated level of political instability will ensure that the Maduro regime continues to be challenged economically and politically. Low international crude prices, combined with US sanctions on the regime, mean that Venezuela is struggling to place its oil exports abroad. We therefore forecast a reduction in domestic crude production in the coming months. Moreover, given that it will lose control of the legislature in 2021, the opposition will be under strong pressure this year to step up its efforts to oust the regime. Mr Maduro will continue to face challenges to maintain the current patronage system and remain in control.
- De facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding. Concurrently, the government has taken measures that have allowed the official exchange rate to float. These measures have so far aided price stability and therefore increase the availability of some basic goods. However, the measures are not a product of economic orthodoxy, but of policy decisions to ensure the regime's survival. We do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that will be required to resolve the economic crisis within the forecast period.

- Venezuela is ranked 82nd of 82 countries in the global business environment rankings for 2020-24, having been in 80th place in the 2015-19 historical period, as the economic crisis deepens despite minor improvements. Reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment are unlikely.

Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: Expansion of interventionist measures, including price controls. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and continue to undermine free competition.
2022-24: Contract rights remain weak, and red tape and ad hoc interventionism continue.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Most attempts to attract investment prove unsuccessful, owing to political and economic instability.
2022-24: Actual investment flows remain low amid ongoing economic volatility. Intellectual property protection and private property rights deteriorate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: Currency controls are weakened, but access to foreign currency remains limited.
2022-24: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, and de facto dollarisation advances. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves as oil prices rise, albeit slowly.
Taxes 2020-21: Risk of further unrest and political instability reduces probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major rise in public spending.
2022-24: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2020-21: Inflation remains high and concerns surrounding economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2022-24: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2020-21: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Past emigration of skilled labour aggravates skills shortages.
2022-24: Labour-market rigidities persist, despite some increase in flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2020-21: Underinvestment in water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts.
2022-24: Investors remain highly cautious of committing to long-term capital projects. Infrastructure deteriorates even further.
Technological readiness 2020-21: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment, but with little interest.
2022-24: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013 proved unsuccessful. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his own popularity plummet as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices, combined with strict sanctions on trade from the US, has plunged the country into a severe economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly (AN). In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature to be in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017, a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the AN.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports, and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$20.9bn in 2018 as the destruction of domestic supply led to increasing import dependence. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates the 2018 current-account surplus to be 3.6% of GDP.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit considers that the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak and diminished oil rents-resulting from low international oil prices and existing US sanctions-present hefty challenges for the survival of the military regime led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV). Owing to the bleak state of its healthcare system, Venezuela faces an uphill battle against the coronavirus, and there is a high risk that the ongoing socioeconomic crisis could evolve into a humanitarian calamity. The government's mandatory social distancing measures will be a source of unrest-as many workers simply lack the savings they need to survive without continuing to work-as will Mr Maduro's decision to remove some petrol subsidies in the face of fuel shortages.
Despite these compounding social and economic shocks, we expect Mr Maduro to retain power throughout 2020, ruling over what is becoming a much less populous and much poorer country. Mr Maduro has two main factors in his favour. First, the opposition led by the head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, has lost the momentum that it held in 2019. Secondly, the regime retains strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces. Although the risks to our forecasts are very high, we assume that this control-together with the complexity of the security apparatus and the recurrent purges within it-will allow the regime to manage internal dissent.
Mr Maduro' recent actions show that he has the upper hand against the opposition. The new electoral council, inaugurated on June 12th, was packed with Mr Maduro's allies, while opposition members loyal to the regime were appointed as heads of two key opposition parties-Primero Justicia and Voluntad Popular. These actions set the stage for rigged parliamentary elections in December as opposition forces are now effectively disabled. The brazenness of these actions show that Mr Maduro is unperturbed by potential retaliation by the opposition and that political pressure against him is wavering.
Although it is not part of our baseline forecast, we recognise that there is a high risk of some sort of political transition. There are three main paths to this: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We assess the prospect of military action by the US or Colombia as low, and we consider that a negotiated transition would also be difficult. In early March the US outlined a transition framework in which both Mr Maduro and Mr Guaidó would allow a new state council to be created and fresh elections to be held. However, the appointment of Maduro loyalists to the new electoral council demonstrated that this proposal has failed, as trust issues between the two sides are insurmountable.
We believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The regime's main weakness is the fragility of its internal finances. Its patronage system is crucial for sustaining its security apparatus and resisting social unrest. Low international crude prices, US sanctions and the dampening effect of a global recession on workers' remittances will shrink dollar inflows further. The regime will continue to benefit from funds from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities, but a lack of hard currency could prove fatal to the patronage system and will test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks. The regime's liquidity problems, and a rapidly worsening socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis, could prompt putsch attempts in the near term.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch Legislative elections will take place on December 6th, assuming that Mr Maduro clings to power and that the polls are not cancelled (Mr Maduro has hinted that they could be suspended owing to the coronavirus pandemic). These elections would be neither free nor fair, and the opposition would lose control of the National Assembly. If the opposition were to secure some sort of political change in 2020, the interim government would pursue deep-seated reforms to the electoral authority and attempt to hold a vote within 12 months of its formation, although achieving this would be a major challenge.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations Mr Guaidó has marshalled strong support from the international community, but efforts by most governments in Latin America to support him have reached an impasse. Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, the US, has instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions-most recently placing severe restrictions on the Venezuelan operations of Chevron (a US oil company)-and has openly called for the Venezuelan military to accept Mr Guaidó in place of Mr Maduro. The US expects sanctions to put enough pressure on the regime's finances (and therefore on its patronage system) to force Mr Maduro to hold free and fair elections. The US also warned of additional sanctions in the near future. The US administration will remain hawkish in its approach to foreign policy, but we believe that a military intervention is unlikely, given the aversion of the US president, Donald Trump, to such adventurism. If tensions rise and political violence increases, the possibility of smaller-scale interventions cannot be discounted. Looking ahead, regardless of whether Mr Trump or his opponent, Joe Biden wins the US election (our baseline forecast is for a Biden victory), we expect US sanctions to remain in place owing to strong bipartisan support. That said, efforts to reach a negotiated exit for Mr Maduro would increase under a Biden administration.
Mr Maduro's main international backers are Cuba, Russia, China and-more recently-Iran. Russia is helping Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA, the Venezuelan state-owned oil company) to circumvent US sanctions; in March the Venezuelan assets of Rosneft (a Russian energy company) were transferred directly to Russia, representing a step-up in the US-Russia diplomatic crossfire over Venezuela. Nevertheless, both Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the financing-amounting to tens of billions of US dollars per year-required to stabilise the economy and secure PDVSA's long-term future. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries, but seems to have had little success in securing finance for investment. If a transition from the Maduro regime were to come about, we believe that Russia and China would be willing to work with Mr Maduro's successor to protect their current investments. Iran recently sent 1.5m barrels of petrol to Venezuela in exchange for gold shipments and is helping to fix the Paraguaná oil refinery.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends The Maduro regime will focus on weathering the fuel shortages and containing the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Despite community spread and an accelerating number of Covid-19 cases, Mr Maduro has eased nationwide quarantine measures to some degree. A "7/7" system is currently in place, whereby seven days of more flexible social distancing measures will be followed by seven of tighter restrictions. Measures will remain in place over the short to medium term as Venezuela's health system is simply unprepared to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. The country's medical infrastructure is poor and hospitals face significant shortages of water, soap, medicines and electricity.
Given the risk that fuel shortages pose to the regime, Mr Maduro has taken some steps to alleviate fuel scarcity. On May 31st the regime announced a two-tiered petrol distribution system. Drivers will be subject to a monthly quota of subsidised petrol. When this has been reached, petrol will be available at internationally indexed prices. The regime will also designate 200 fuel stations across Venezuela, which will be operated by independent or private companies, with petrol in these stations costing a fixed US$0.50/litre. These measures seek to regularise black-market activity so that the regime (rather than a third party) benefits from the gains. Nonetheless, this will only work to an extent, as arbitrage opportunities are still possible under the new subsidy system.
Based on our view that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout our 2020-24 forecast period, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that are required to resolve the economic crisis. De facto dollarisation is expanding; although this was not a tacit goal for the regime, Mr Maduro now welcomes it. Other under-the-radar adjustments are possible in the coming years, as long as these benefit the regime's survival. Such efforts alone are unlikely to bring about economic stability, owing to the absence of a comprehensive microeconomic reform or improvements in the rule of law, and policy predictability will not be forthcoming under the current regime.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy The authorities have not published complete data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect the non-financial public-sector deficit to narrow in 2020, and the public debt/GDP ratio to remain high in the coming years. The sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will curb government spending. The regime relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Money printing will continue to finance the government's deficits in 2020-24. However, over the medium term, growing remittance inflows will partly offset the need to monetise budget deficits. We currently assume no debt restructuring during the forecast period. Venezuela's weak fiscal position is complicated by the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing-mainly PDVSA-issued debt and development funds from China-that understates the true size of total public liabilities.
All of the sovereign's outstanding global bonds are in arrears. However, bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy shifts or a change in government. The key PDVSA 2020 bond, which was secured using 50.1% of the shares of Citgo (PDVSA's US subsidiary) as collateral, fell due at end-October 2019 and was not paid. A US court ruled that PDVSA is an "alter ego" of the Venezuelan government; this will have far-reaching implications, as some international firms are seeking to seize shares of Citgo stock. However, the US considers Citgo to be under Mr Guaidó's purview, thus currently shielding Citgo assets from seizure by creditors.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy The government's financing needs will force the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) to ramp up money printing in the short term. Growing dollarisation and a strong contraction in domestic demand slowed hyperinflationary pressures in 2019. However, we expect hyperinflation to return in the coming months, owing to monetisation of large fiscal deficits and severe goods shortages. Overall, hyperinflation will continue until its underlying causes are addressed. Hyperinflation has quickened the pace of dollarisation of the economy (more than 50% of transactions are now thought to be conducted in US dollars). We believe that Venezuela is heading towards overall de facto dollarisation. Monthly inflation will rise again in the short term and will remain substantial. However, given the effect of dollarisation on price stability, we do not expect a return to the extremely high annual inflation rates of more than 1,000,000% experienced in 2018.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth Low crude prices and weak oil exports will put significant pressure on the country to slash crude production. Venezuela's average break-even price is about US$15-20/barrel. US sanctions on the regime raise the risks involved in dealing with Venezuela, forcing the country to offer a hefty discount on its crude. This means that, at current market prices, Venezuela is making only a limited profit (its oil basket reached an estimated US$25/b by end-June). The current circumstances have inevitably led to production cuts; oil output fell to 570,000 barrels/day (b/d) in May, according to OPEC. However, we believe that average output could fall to as low as 500,000 b/d over the coming months.
In 2021 we expect the economy to grow marginally, owing to a stabilisation of oil output, base effects and the lifting of social distancing measures. In 2022 economic growth will accelerate on the back of a surge in oil prices. However, in the medium term, oil output will continue to fall-albeit gradually-owing to serious operational problems (such as difficulties in obtaining equipment for repairs or finding qualified staff) and to a limited pool of suitable buyers of Venezuelan crude. Export volumes will start to recover marginally in 2022-24 (owing to moderately higher global oil prices), as producers become more accustomed to the new post-sanctions export markets. Furthermore, relative macroeconomic stability will allow the non-oil economy to recover marginally in the medium term. There are substantial risks to our forecasts, which assume that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout the forecast period. In the event of a transition, there would be upside risks to our medium-term baseline; the degree of improvement would depend on the characteristics of the transition and on the new government's macroeconomic programme.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation Severely reduced domestic supply, constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits will continue to stoke hyperinflation this year. Dollarisation and the regime's heavy restrictions on credit helped to subdue hyperinflation in the second half of 2019. Still, consumer prices rose by 15% month on month in May-the weakest monthly increment in over three years. This deceleration owes to subsiding effects of social distancing measures on demand-side inflationary pressures. However, as the economy reopens inflationary pressures will strengthen, owing to fuel scarcity, price controls and the ramping up of government money printing.
In the medium term, inflation will remain high for as long as the Maduro regime is in power, given huge fundamental imbalances between supply and demand, and the need for the regime to monetise its fiscal deficits. Weather-related shocks are a perennial risk to the inflation outlook.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates Hyperinflation will quicken the pace of bolívar depreciation in 2020. Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency denomination (as in March 2018) or a new currency is a strong possibility, although the exact nature of such a move is hard to forecast. In mid-2019 the regime announced a loosening of currency controls. Although this was a positive move, significant barriers limit access to US dollars via formal means. We still believe that the government will maintain a number of indirect controls on the foreign-exchange market. In this context, a black-market exchange-rate premium is inevitable. On June 26th the official exchange rate was BsS202,080:US$1, compared with a black-market rate of BsS210,120:US$1. The premium (currently 4%) is small by historical comparison.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector Venezuela will post a small current-account deficit of 2.1% of GDP in 2020, owing to lower oil exports and limited remittance inflows resulting from the global recession. The BCV's official figures for 2017-18 show that Venezuela posted current-account surpluses in this period. In 2019 the collapse of goods export earnings (owing to US sanctions on the oil trade) hit the trade balance hard. Nevertheless, based on the latest data, we estimate that the current account remained in surplus as a result of growing inflows of workers' remittances and the non-payment of interest on bonded debt (saving in excess of US$5bn in 2019). We expect the current account to return to surplus in the medium term, averaging 5.2% of GDP in 2022-24. Goods exports will recover as international oil prices increase and the country steps up trade with Asian markets. This recovery will be supported by continued weakness in domestic demand, rising remittances from abroad and the fact that the sovereign will remain in default throughout the forecast period.

Full text: - An economic crisis stemming from the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic will complicate policymaking for the government, led by Lenín Moreno, for the remainder of the president's term (which ends in May 2021). Commitment to fiscal discipline in the face of a deteriorating macroeconomic environment will embolden political opposition to the government ahead of presidential and legislative elections in February 2021 and will raise the risk of social unrest. Irrespective of the election outcome, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects sizeable barriers to both governing and stability to persist, considering the highly fragmented political landscape. Assuming that a centrist government is elected, these headwinds will hamper piecemeal liberalising economic reforms.
- Ecuador is one of the smallest markets in our business environment rankings. The country's mineral reserves will continue to attract oil and mining investors, but the domestic market will grow only slightly as it struggles to recover from the recession engendered by the coronavirus outbreak. We forecast that GDP per head (at market exchange rates) will rise only marginally in 2021-24, after falling by about 8% in 2020, and will remain below its 2019 level of US$6,206. As such, business opportunities will continue to be restricted by low purchasing power and a small market size.
- Under the auspices of the IMF, the government will cut public spending and investment to shore up the public finances. Despite a statistical rebound in real GDP in 2021, the country's short-term growth prospects will be curbed by soft oil prices, which will also weigh on the fiscal and external accounts. Notwithstanding political and economic uncertainties, we expect dollarisation to be maintained in the 2020-24 forecast period, as it remains popular for delivering macroeconomic stability and taming inflation.
- Ecuador's population growth is slowing but will average 1.3% per year in 2020-24; this is on a par with growth in neighbouring Andean countries. The unemployment rate will average 6% in 2020-24, but underemployment will stay high. The informal sector will remain substantial, partly owing to labour market rigidities. Although low levels of productivity and a wealth of natural resources offer scope for Ecuador to catch up with more developed countries, poor prospects for institutional improvements are likely to preclude a stable economic policy direction and OECD-like income levels in the long term.

- Ecuador scores poorly in our business environment rankings owing to its dependence on oil and the current administration's timid embrace of orthodox policymaking. Although the country's score improves slightly in the forecast period, its global ranking remains low. The government will seek more private investment, but structural shortcomings in the investment environment will not be fully addressed, hindering investors' perceptions.

Country forecast overview: Ecuador's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: Fuel subsidies are partially lifted. Implementation of anti-trust policies is subject to politicisation. Select industries (such as mining) benefit from policies promoting supply-side growth.
2022-24: Government continues to scale back state's role in development. Nonetheless, regulation and licensing continue to favour state-run companies over private-sector firms. New public-private partnership model is trialled.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Overtures to foreign firms and pro-business reforms partly offset government's continued interventionism.
2022-24: Inadequate property rights protection and questions regarding access to foreign arbitration deter investment. New mining projects attract investment.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: Government maintains capital outflows tax and increases import tariffs to protect dollarisation. Efforts to pursue free-trade agreements (FTAs) flounder amid collapse in global trade and growing protectionism by major trading partners.
2022-24: Supply-side reforms enhance national competitiveness and government begins to phase out capital outflows tax.
Taxes 2020-21: Government implements tax reform to expand tax base and improve collection. Certain exemptions are eliminated, and other burdensome regulations are simplified.

Background: Ecuador restored its presidential democracy in 1979, but its institutions remain fragile. External economic shocks have contributed to the ousting of three presidents by popular protest since 1997. The current president, Lenín Moreno, took office in May 2017, succeeding Rafael Correa (2007-17)-the longest-serving president in Ecuadorean history. In February 2018 a series of constitutional reforms introduced by Mr Moreno (including the reintroduction of a two-term limit for the presidency) were approved by referendum. Although this was a step towards deeper democratisation, persistent social and fiscal challenges will continue to weigh on governability.
Political structure: The 2008 constitution increased executive power but has done little to foster institutional capacity to tackle problems such as a politicised judiciary, powerful business lobbies, and mobilised grassroots and indigenous groups. The political system is fragmented. Mr Moreno retains strong executive powers, but his party, Alianza País, lost considerable standing after it splintered following the results of the 2018 referendum.
Policy issues: Dollarisation has provided macroeconomic stability but exposed Ecuador's underlying lack of competitive-ness. Modest oil prices during the 2020-24 forecast period, relative to the previous decade, have necessitated fiscal adjustments. The Moreno administration secured a three-year IMF agreement-along with other multilateral financing-in March 2019 to meet various objectives, including putting the public finances on a sustainable trajectory, but programme performance has been lacking. The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic will further complicate the government's reform agenda, especially given the lack of fiscal space to counter the hit to the economy and financial system.
Taxation: Taxes have been subject to frequent changes. The main taxes in Ecuador are income tax, levied at rates of up to 35%, and value-added tax (VAT), levied at 12%. Private firms must distribute 15% of their profits among their employees.
Foreign trade: Ecuador recorded a trade surplus of US$1bn in 2019; petrol export earnings averaged 39% of total export revenue, compared with over 50% during the commodity boom in the 2000s.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic presents the president, Lenín Moreno, with two immense challenges before his term ends in May 2021. First, his administration must manage the health crisis with limited resources. Despite the swift imposition (in mid-March) of strict national lockdown measures, including a daily curfew from 2pm to 5am, the virus has spread unabated, with more than 55,200 cases reported as at June 28th. A gradual, region-by-region easing of restrictions began on May 4th, but the process will be slow and the risk of a second wave of infections will persist as economic activity resumes.
The president's second challenge is to stabilise the economy as oil prices languish, lockdown measures stifle activity and external demand shrinks. With no fiscal space to mount a countercyclical response (Mr Moreno has announced aggressive cuts to public spending), the political opposition will be emboldened and the risk of social unrest will be significantly heightened.
These immense challenges will prove awkward for the president to overcome. His party, Alianza País (AP), has 42 seats in the legislature, 27 short of the threshold for a majority. Considering that a general election is approaching (due in February 2021) and that the government is implementing austerity measures amid a crisis, the opposition will offer limited support, and some members of Mr Moreno's party will be reluctant to back his policies. The conservative Partido Social Cristiano (PSC) and the left-wing Revolución Ciudadana (RC), the faction loyal to Mr Moreno's predecessor, Rafael Correa (2007-17), will be overtly obstructionist. Mr Moreno's popularity will provide little upside; his approval rating stood at 14.7% in May, down from 24.7% a year earlier.
Despite this-and although political jockeying will be a constant undercurrent as elections draw near-The Economist Intelligence Unit expects cross-party support for some government policies to materialise. In particular, the conservative Creando Oportunidades (Creo) party may yet extend further support to the government (as it did in mid-May, after Mr Moreno abandoned plans to raise taxes as part of the government's emergency economic legislation). However, even assuming that the government secures enough support to facilitate policymaking, political uncertainties will prevail (rather than dissipate) in the short to medium term as the economy enters a sharp recession.
There is a high probability that protests will occur in the next few months. Informal employment as a percentage of total non-agricultural employment is over 60%, and there is little relief coming from the government, which does not have the fiscal capacity to help to offset losses faced by informal workers, let alone formal businesses. Austerity measures on top of the worsening economic conditions will amplify the likelihood of unrest. In particular, labour unions and indigenous groups, including the Confederación de Nacionalidades Indígenas del Ecuador (Conaie, Ecuador's largest indigenous organisation), which was largely responsible for intense protests in October 2019, will pressure the government to change course.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch The February 2021 general election outlook is highly nebulous at this stage, given uncertainty regarding the course of the pandemic. Nevertheless, we do not expect any party to secure the presidency without a run-off vote; to do so, it would have to garner 50% of the first-round vote or secure 40% with a 10-percentage-point margin of victory over its rivals. Mr Moreno does not intend to run for re-election. Considering his government's commitment to unpopular economic measures, it is unlikely that a member of his centre-left AP would secure enough support to win outright. A first-round victory for Creo's leader, Guillermo Lasso, or for candidates from the PSC or RC, is equally unlikely, given the fractured nature of the political landscape. However, as Mr Correa has the enduring support of about 20% of the electorate, a candidate backed by him (probably from the RC) is likely to play a significant role and reach the second round.
In the event of a second round, we believe that a candidate pursuing broadly centrist economic policies would be most likely to take the presidency. Although a Correa-backed candidate would be well poised to reach the second round, there are factors (most notably corruption) weighing on Mr Correa's appeal; the former president was sentenced to eight years in prison on bribery charges in April. Meanwhile, the PSC performed well in municipal elections in March 2019, and Creo's appeal may grow as it attempts to improve its image through a renewed focus on governance. The vice-president, Otto Sonnenholzner of the AP, may also run, having risen to prominence through his role in spearheading the government's pandemic response. A deepening of the economic crisis, leading to political instability, is a major risk to our outlook.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations The coronavirus pandemic will encumber Mr Moreno's liberalising trade agenda in the short term. We expect only limited progress on discussions with the US about a free-trade agreement (FTA) and on the country's accession to the Pacific Alliance (a regional trade bloc) for the remainder of his presidency. The absence of an existing bilateral agreement with Mexico will present a challenge beyond the near term; before the crisis the two parties ambitiously set February 7th 2021 (the date of Ecuador's general election) as the deadline for an FTA. This appears increasingly unfeasible, and Ecuador's chances of entering the bloc by 2024 have declined considerably, despite support from the presidents in the Alliance and from Mexico's foreign minister. In addition to the coronavirus pandemic, changes in government and policy direction may hinder the accession process.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends The economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic will push Ecuador closer to a disorderly default and a balance-of-payments crisis. Having made an agreement with private creditors in April to defer interest payments of US$811m due between late March and August 15th, the government is seeking an amicable restructuring of its debt with its creditors. Although we expect the government to successfully reach an agreement with bondholders, the risk of a disorderly default cannot be discounted. Avoiding this outcome will require, more than ever, support from the IMF (and other actors), but meeting the conditions required to access funds from these sources will be extremely complicated politically, heightening risks in the coming months.
In the face of political pressure to loosen fiscal policy and suspend external debt payments, Mr Moreno will try to maintain discipline and work to improve the country's credibility. This will catalyse much-needed multilateral financial assistance. In the wake of the coronavirus crisis, the government nullified its three-year, US$4.2bn extended fund facility (EFF) with the IMF (accompanied by US$6bn in additional multilateral financing, intended to be disbursed between March 2019 and December 2021). It also accessed US$643m through the Fund's rapid financing instrument (RFI) in early May-the RFI is being extended to many emerging markets around the world and comes without the conditionalities that a fully fledged IMF programme entails. However, the RFI and other recent multilateral financing-US$500m from the World Bank and US$300m from the Development Bank of Latin America-will not be sufficient to stave off economic collapse.
A successor arrangement with the Fund will be vital in navigating the economic crisis at hand. Negotiations with the Fund will be buoyed by the passage of emergency economic legislation in May that goes beyond the immediate necessities of the pandemic. Approved reforms to public financial management will reduce discretionary budget changes considerably and establish a savings fund, improving the country's medium-term fiscal framework. However, an uncertain economic and political outlook is likely to weigh on the Fund's willingness to pledge a large amount of financing. Assuming that a centre-right or centre-left government takes office in May 2021 and provides for policy continuity, we expect that improving competitiveness, tackling fiscal imbalances, protecting the poor and fighting corruption-the primary objectives of the government's defunct EFF-will continue to be priorities. At the same time, given these political assumptions and the depth of the economic crisis, we view IMF assistance beyond 2021 as highly probable, suggesting a piecemeal advancement of business-friendly policies and complementary reforms in 2021-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy The non-financial public-sector (NFPS) deficit will widen to 7% of GDP in 2020, as the already shaky finances coming into the coronavirus crisis will be hit hard by a sudden halt in domestic economic activity and lower oil revenue than budgeted. The government will attempt to offset the erosion of revenue through sweeping procyclical spending reductions to the tune of US$4bn (about 4% of GDP and 15% of the original 2020 budget). However, even assuming that spending cuts materialise, that debt-servicing costs are reduced through bond renegotiations and that new, extraordinary multilateral and bilateral assistance is forthcoming, the damage will be substantial. We expect public debt as a percentage of GDP to rise from an estimated 46.9% in 2019 to 60% in 2020.
Assuming broad policy continuity, and without details of the government's prospective successor IMF agreement, we expect that the NFPS deficit will narrow gradually from 2021, shrinking to 1.6% of GDP by 2024, and that the public debt/GDP ratio will stabilise at about 61%. The successor programme to the government's defunct EFF will shed light on how fiscal targets and fiscal policymaking will adapt to the looming economic recession. Given the deterioration of economic conditions, we expect the Fund to be more lenient in its terms, but irrespective of the changes to the programme, implementation risks will be alarmingly high, as social and political obstacles to reform exceed their pre-crisis levels.
Although we are cautiously optimistic that the government will avoid a disorderly default, there are substantial economic and political risks to our assumptions. On the one hand, it remains to be seen whether the depth of the recession will prove too challenging for the government to navigate, even with multilateral and bilateral financing (the government estimates that it will receive about US$2bn from multilateral creditors and China) and the successful execution of debt-management operations. On the other hand, although it is not our baseline forecast, there is a risk that next year's general election will result in victory for a populist government that then cuts ties with the Fund and suspends external debt payments, despite the fact that doing so would lead to an extremely severe crisis and put dollarisation at risk. If either of these risks were to materialise, we would revise our assumptions.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy As a dollarised economy, Ecuador lacks independent monetary policy and will not be able to foment a monetary policy response to the economic crisis. Monetary conditions will continue to be determined largely by external factors, but real local rates will remain elevated, owing to Ecuador's high risk premium. Monetary growth will hinge on foreign-exchange inflows and the confidence of domestic lenders, both of which will be markedly undermined by the rapid deterioration of the economy. The threat of de-dollarisation will sustain the risk of capital flight, which in turn raises the risk of preventative measures being implemented in the short term to protect domestic liquidity levels.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth We expect Ecuador to endure its worst recession since the financial crisis that it suffered at the turn of the century; we forecast that real GDP will shrink by 11.5% in 2020, driven by a severe contraction in the second quarter. Export volumes will decrease by 15% as external demand falls markedly. However, this drop will be overshadowed by a sizeable 26% decline in import volumes, reflecting a significant deterioration in domestic demand.
Low oil receipts will lead to a retrenchment in government consumption, indirectly feeding through to private consumption, which will be constrained by a worsening labour market. Economic and political uncertainties will weigh on private investment, which will decline for a second consecutive year. Assuming that the coronavirus outbreak is more under control by end-2020-prompting a recovery in external and domestic demand-we expect growth to rebound in 2021, but real GDP will remain below 2019 levels.
Political uncertainties will be elevated ahead of the February 2021 general election, precluding a more robust pick-up in domestic demand. We expect growth to be modest in 2022 (following the 2021 rebound), but it should slowly improve thereafter as policy uncertainties wane, oil prices rise and moderate improvements to the business environment materialise.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation Softening commodity prices, weak demand and a stronger US dollar will produce deflation this year. Consumer prices were flat in 2019, and we expect them to fall by 0.6% by year-end. We expect inflation to pick up slightly, to an annual average of 0.9% in 2021-24, as import costs rise owing to renewed dollar weakness and an increase in commodity prices. Dollarisation will help to contain inflation, but the economy will remain vulnerable to increases in food and energy prices.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates Risks to dollarisation have risen and will remain elevated in the short term. The economic crisis presents major problems of financing and liquidity, as oil prices have tumbled and access to global financing is limited. These problems are likely to be exacerbated by a short-term strengthening of the US dollar (hurting competitiveness) and a dip in reserves.
Nevertheless, we currently assume that dollarisation will be retained in the 2020-24 forecast period, as the government's commitment to its IMF agreement and to fiscal discipline allows for greater multilateral financing. The real effective exchange rate will remain stronger than its long-term, pre-dollarisation average, but there will be some depreciation in real, trade-weighted terms as the US dollar begins to weaken in 2021-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector The current-account deficit will widen in 2020 as the external backdrop deteriorates. A slump in oil revenue will weigh significantly on the trade balance in the short term as oil prices and external demand recover at a tepid pace. Non-oil export earnings will slip, owing to domestic restrictions on business operations to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and a retraction of demand in major export markets, but will retain some dynamism as external demand recovers. The deterioration of the trade balance will be softened by import compression as the domestic economy languishes, but remittances are likely to suffer, as economic activity has ground to a halt outside Ecuador, widening the current-account deficit. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows will suffer in 2020-21 and remain below 1% of GDP. They will pick up thereafter and average 1% of GDP in 2022-24.
