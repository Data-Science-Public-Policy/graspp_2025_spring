Background: The political geography of Europe has been defined by two world wars. The EU's creation dates back to the Rome Treaty of 1957, which created the European Economic Community between the six founding EU member states (France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg). After four enlargements in 1973 (UK, Denmark, Ireland), 1981 (Greece), 1986 (Spain and Portugal) and 1995 (Austria, Finland and Sweden), the EU counted 15 members. The collapse in 1991 of the Soviet Union provided an opportunity to expand the EU eastwards. Ten new member states (eight from the former communist bloc) were admitted to the EU in 2004, followed by a further two in 2007, and Croatia in 2013. In June 2016 the UK electorate voted in a referendum to withdraw from the EU. The UK formally left the bloc in January 2020 and a transition period will end on December 31st 2020. The economic transition of the Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) has proceeded more smoothly than those of other east European countries. The effects of war in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and a slower pace of reform have shaped changes in south-eastern Europe. In the Commonwealth of Independent States, many countries continue to have deep economic and political ties with Russia.
Political structure: All 27 EU member states are parliamentary democracies, although in some of the newer, former communist members in particular, the substance of democracy-including a political culture based on trust and political participation-is often absent. The communist period lasted much longer in the former Soviet Union, and political developments in most parts of that region have been characterised by a drift towards authoritarianism.
Policy issues: Fiscal and monetary policy levers are currently being used to the full across Europe to counter the damaging economic impact of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and lockdown measures. Many aspects of domestic policy for EU member states-notably those relating to the single market-are decided collectively at EU level. A total of 19 EU members share the euro as their currency and are subject to a single monetary policy administered by the European Central Bank. They are supposed to comply with common fiscal rules, although these have sometimes been ignored. During the euro zone debt crisis, several member states (Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain) received financial support from the EU and the IMF in return for fiscal and economic reforms. Outside the EU, the speed and extent of reform and institutional change vary widely. Countries with proximity to Western markets and with stable political outlooks have proceeded faster-and more successfully-with economic stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation. Institutional problems, such as weakness in the rule of law and widespread corruption, plague much of non-EU Europe.
Taxation: Individual tax regimes operate in all countries. All EU member states must operate a system of value-added tax (VAT), with a minimum of 15% as the standard rate.
Foreign trade: If intra-EU trade is included, the EU accounts for about half of all global trade. About 60% of trade conducted by EU member states is intra-regional.

Summary Political stability
- The political fallout from the coronavirus crisis could be far-reaching and political risk will remain high in Europe during the forecast period (2020-24).
- As the crisis continues through 2020-21 it will exacerbate existing fault lines within the bloc and may over the medium term lead to greater ruptures.
- Popular disaffection with traditional mainstream parties will persist, leading to a more fragmented political landscape and fractious coalitions.
- The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, put forward an ambitious policy agenda in 2019, but the coronavirus emergency, and political divisions in the EU, will delay progress in many areas.
- The UK left the EU on January 31st 2020 and is in a transition period until the end of this year. There will not be an extension of the transition. A minimal free-trade deal is still possible, but the risk of no deal has increased.

Economic policy
- Extraordinary monetary and fiscal policy levers are being used to counter the damaging economic impact of the pandemic and national lockdowns.
- The European Central Bank (ECB) is playing an important role in maintaining market sentiment, keeping access to financing open even for the most indebted members of the euro zone and limiting the risk of a debt crisis.
- At the national level, emergency fiscal plans have been rolled out rapidly, with liquidity support for companies and households, but disagreement has delayed progress on an EU-wide recovery fund.

Economic growth We expect the euro zone to contract sharply in 2020, by 8% as a consequence of the supply- and demand-side shock resulting from the coronavirus pandemic.

- East European economies will also experience a deep economic slump in 2020, and commodity producers will be badly affected by an oil price crash.
- The recovery will be slow. We do not expect any European economy to regain 2019 real GDP levels until 2022; many will do so in 2023; some in 2024.

Business environment rankings
- The negative economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic will result in a deterioration in business environments in most European countries.

Political outlook: Political stability The political fallout from the coronavirus (Covid-19) crisis is likely to be far-reaching, with implications for government stability and EU unity. As the crisis continues through 2020-21 we expect that it will exacerbate existing fault-lines within the bloc and may over the medium term lead to ruptures.
Political ramifications of the crisis are likely to be far-reaching During the first phase of the pandemic in Europe, which started in February 2020, public support for governments rose, as tends to be the case during times of crises. However, this did not last everywhere. The polarisation of government and opposition has for the most part continued in most countries in the face of the public health emergency. In some countries, especially those that have imposed harsh lockdowns-notably in France, Italy and Spain-existing public dissatisfaction with governments may have intensified. The eruption of protests in European cities in June in response to the brutal police killing of George Floyd (a civilian) in the US may, to some extent, have been a vehicle for the release of pent-up anger and frustration with the domestic authorities after months of being in lockdown.
It is unlikely that political peace will reign for long once countries emerge from the first phase of the public health crisis, if only because the economic and social challenges confronting them will be enormous. Afterwards, governments will face intense scrutiny of their response. Nationalist parties that oppose globalisation are likely to make renewed calls for curbs on migration and reshoring of supply chains, and can expect a bump in popularity. This is likely to worsen the fragmentation of European politics, which has made forming stable and cohesive coalitions difficult in recent years.
Europe divided: schisms between north and south sharpen The crisis has brought underlying tensions and conflicts in the EU bloc to the surface, and is likely to accentuate them. One example is the acrimonious debate over what kind of rescue package and recovery fund would be suitable in the current circumstances. Negotiations over a financial package in April led to ill-tempered public exchanges and soured the mood in the bloc. A compromise was eventually reached to provide EUR540bn in credit lines, but this was of limited help to countries that lacked fiscal space. Talks on a more ambitious response were deadlocked until a Franco-German proposal for a EUR500bn recovery fund in mid-May. This marked a major shift in the German position, with the acceptance of joint debt issuance and grants for the worst-hit countries, and opened the door to the European Commission's EUR750bn proposal, which is currently under discussion. It faces resistance from some northern countries, and must receive unanimous backing from all 27 governments (and parliamentary ratification) to pass. The magnitude of economic support provided is of less importance than the political statement made: this fund could set a precedent for a fiscal economic stabilisation tool in the EU.
Intra-bloc disagreements will persist, however-and not just regarding fiscal integration. An early May ruling by Germany's constitutional court in Karlsruhe (a German city) openly questioned the authority of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the soundness of its 2018 judgement over actions taken by the European Central Bank (ECB) in 2015. The episode highlighted long-standing uncertainty in the EU legal order over the prerogatives of European institutions versus those of national legal bodies and could lead to further challenges.
Other threats to European political stability over the medium term include the damaging impact of the UK's decision to leave the EU; the impact of the "America First" policies put in place by the US president, Donald Trump; disagreement over how to manage migration policy and the proper balance between national sovereignty and "pooled sovereignty"; and increased divergence over values between political elites and electorates.
Brexit will present a major challenge to the unity of the EU in the medium term The UK's departure from the EU in January 2020 will pose a major challenged to the unity of the bloc in years to come. The country's departure has left a hole in the EU budget, which will be difficult to overcome without generating antagonism within the bloc. Brexit resulted in increased European solidarity, because leading member states such as France and Germany were keen to send a strong political message that a departure from the bloc would be more damaging for the exiting member state than for the EU. However, over the medium to longer term such unity could fray, especially if the UK thrives outside the EU.
Building consensus for strategic change at the European level will be difficult The coronavirus crisis presents a huge challenge for the new European Commission, which took office on December 1st 2019 after a protracted process of appointing candidates to the top jobs following the European Parliament elections in May 2019. In July EU heads of state reached a compromise on Ursula von der Leyen as European Commission president; Christine Lagarde as the president of the European Central Bank (ECB); Charles Michel as president of the European Council; and Josep Borrell as high representative for foreign affairs and security policy. After presenting an ambitious policy agenda in late 2019, Ms von der Leyen's Commission has so far performed poorly in response to the coronavirus crisis.
The deep recession confronting the entire bloc in 2020 and a focus on the post-coronavirus economic recovery are likely to sideline much of Ms von der Leyen's policy agenda. This was supposed to address issues such as climate change, technology and demographics, with a European Green Deal that aims to make the EU carbon neutral by 2050 to be presented in the first half of 2020. We expect the Commission to face significant challenges-in the first instance from policy disagreements over the funding of the recovery phase. Negotiations on the seven-year multi-annual financial framework are likely to be even more acrimonious in the context of the economic damage done by the pandemic. Building consensus on difficult issues within a fragmented European Parliament will be a tough task.
Political outlook: Election watch General elections across Europe since 2017 have confirmed rising disaffection with the political establishment, which has been reflected in the decline of the two-party system and the rise of insurgent populist parties. Increasing political fragmentation across the region has resulted in a more complicated policymaking outlook, but has also made forming governments more difficult and given rise to some unusual coalitions. The snap election held in Ireland in February 2020 was not an exception to this trend, with the incumbents and traditional opposition parties trailing an insurgent Sinn Fein in terms of the popular vote. The two traditional government parties, Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, are trying to assemble a very broad coalition government involving some smaller parties.
A few elections were held in the first few months of 2020, but several were postponed in the wake of the crisis, including two scheduled for April in Serbia and North Macedonia. Serbia's rescheduled parliamentary election on June 21st resulted in a landslide victory for the ruling Serbian Progressive Party of the president, Aleksandar Vucic, and will deepen concerns about creeping authoritarianism there. The postponed election in North Macedonia will be held in July, and Montenegro has brought its parliamentary election forward to August. Five presidential elections and four other parliamentary elections are due to be held in 2020. All except a presidential election in Iceland are in eastern Europe It is not yet clear whether they will all occur, raising troubling questions about how to ensure the continuation of democratic politics and the accountability of governments during the pandemic.

Political outlook: Intra-and inter-regional tensions The EU would like to play a stronger international role in the context of a less predictable global environment, in which the US is a less reliable partner for Europe and China has become a "systemic rival". However, we are sceptical about how much the EU will be able to achieve, given its lack of military capabilities and differences in foreign policy interests among its member states. The EU's slow response to the flare-up of US-Iran tensions in January was indicative of the difficulties that it faces in responding to developing situations. The pandemic may result in an accelerated bifurcation of US and Chinese supply chains, pushing the EU into having to choose between the two.
With the US more domestically focused, geopolitical dynamics are changing Russia has also sought to play a greater role in global affairs over the past decade, and has taken advantage of the vacuum left by the US as that country has retreated from the world stage. In civil conflicts in Syria, Ukraine, Libya and Yemen, the US and Russia, as well as their regional allies, such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey (for the US) and Iran (for Russia), have backed opposing sides and established themselves as critical partners for making war and seeking peace. As such, relations between the EU and Russia, although thorny, will remain pragmatic. Economically, Russia faces a hit this year from both the coronavirus and the oil price crash, and its economy will contract.
Hungary and Poland will continue to clash with the EU over illiberal policies The governments in Hungary and Poland have come into conflict with the EU over the EU's refugee-relocation policy, and have also clashed over values, counterposing their own nationalist, socially conservative outlook with the cosmopolitican, liberal values espoused by the EU. The European Commission has criticised the Hungarian and Polish governments for curbing the independence of the judiciary, establishing government control over the public-service media and clamping down on civil society groups. The Commission has referred several of these measures to the ECJ, but has so far struggled to find an effective response. Steps taken by the Commission and the European Parliament since December 2017 to invoke Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, possibly resulting in the suspension of a member country's voting rights, are unlikely to succeed, as they require the unanimous vote of all members, and Hungary and Poland have made clear that they would support one another in such an event.
Turkey's foreign policy with the EU and US will be increasingly confrontational Turkey's relationships with the EU and the US have shifted under the Justice and Development Party (AKP) since the early 2000s. Declining trust in the US and the EU, and an ambition to make Turkey a regional power have incentivised the AKP to pursue a "Turkey First" approach to foreign policy. By putting its interests first, the country has started to establish transactional co-operation with countries with which it was previously a rival or had limited relations, such as Russia and China. On the downside, Turkey's foreign policy will leave the country strategically isolated, and Turkey's relationship with the US will become increasingly transactional.
The EU has labelled China a systemic rival, and the BRI divides opinion The EU has labelled China a "systemic rival" and has adopted a regulation setting up a framework to scrutinise foreign investments from non-EU countries, a move that is widely understood to be directed towards foreign direct investment (FDI) from China. Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, EU and national-level screening processes have been tightened. The EU supports improving connectivity between Europe and Asia (as pointed out in the EU Connectivity Strategy), but it has not formally come out in support of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)-China's flagship foreign policy initiative that aims to create a "New Silk Road" of trading routes and to expand China's economic and diplomatic ties. However, despite the EU's reluctance to support the BRI, several European countries have signed up to it, including Italy, Portugal, Greece and a number of countries in the western Balkans.
One of the points of concern for the EU regarding the BRI is the near monopoly that Chinese companies enjoy in implementing these projects. Until transparency regarding the terms of BRI funding improves and the procurement processes are made more inclusive and competitive (allowing for participation from European companies), the EU is unlikely to change its stance on the BRI.
Macroeconomic policy The policy response will be substantial, both at national and regional levels Fiscal and monetary policy levers are being used to the full across Europe to counter the damaging impact of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and lockdown measures on the economies of the region.
At the national level, emergency fiscal plans were rolled out rapidly, with liquidity support for companies and measures to prevent a spike in redundancies. Germany, which has long stood by its "balanced budget" rule, has presented the biggest financial assistance programme in the EU, with up to EUR1.2trn (35% of German GDP) to be made available. EU-level fiscal action is being hotly discussed, with concerns about moral hazard being weighed against the imperative of providing economic support.
After lengthy negotiations, euro zone finance ministers reached an agreement on April 9th on a EUR540bn European financial package. The measures are significant, but given the magnitude of the crisis, they are insufficient. The European Council discussed a more ambitious plan at its meeting on April 23rd, but failed to reach a conclusion, instead instructing the European Commission to work on a comprehensive recovery plan.
The Commission is negotiating an EU-wide fiscal package that will comprise joint debt issuance and fiscal transfers. The current proposal involves EUR500bn in grants and EUR250bn in loans for 2021-24; it has the support of France and Germany-after a substantial shift in the German position-but still faces resistance from some north European member states. The size of this fund is less important than the political statement that it makes: should it be approved, it would set a precedent for an EU fiscal economic stabilisation tool.
Negotiations on the 2021-27 multiannual financial framework (MFF), which started two years ago, had made little progress before Europe was hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Following the UK's departure from the EU, disagreements have centred on the size of the budget contribution (1% versus 1.1% of gross national income) and the allocation of the budget. The European Commission now wants to turn the MFF into the centre-piece of the post-coronavirus economic recovery fund.
ECB plays a pivotal role, but the scale of crisis is much bigger than in 2008 The European Central Bank (ECB) as until now been the main player maintaining market sentiment, keeping access to financing open across the bloc and dampening the risk of a debt crisis. With the policy rate already at -0.5%, the ECB has expanded its existing asset-purchase programme, adding a EUR1.35trn emergency programme (10% of euro zone GDP), and loosened the rules so that it can comfortably expand its balance sheet, front-load purchases and target economies with acute funding needs. This has pushed the ECB to its institutional limits, fuelling existing political opposition, most notably from Germany. In the UK, in contrast, the Bank of England (the central bank) is enjoying unprecedented monetary policy co-operation with the British government.

In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the conservative fiscal bias that has prevailed across most of the region since the global crisis of 2008-09 has had to be abandoned. The outbreak of the public health crisis triggered a cascade of policy responses by European governments, which converged on a suite of radical fiscal measures designed to keep businesses afloat for a closure period of several months and to provide basic support for individuals, under the expectation that unemployment is likely to spike to unprecedented levels. For businesses, these initiatives generally include tax holidays or deferments, aid to targeted sectors and, most critically, business loans in the hundreds of billions of euros. For households, governments have mostly adopted some combination of two initiatives: either providing direct cash grants to households (generally, or for individuals such as the self-employed); or agreeing to pay the wages of employees who are furloughed during the period of lockdown.
Although a surge in bankruptcies has been avoided for now, this will not necessarily be the case once governments start to unwind their packages. Once the acute phase of the crisis is over and businesses are no longer receiving exceptional support, it is likely that a significant portion of firms will fail, and that governments will be presented with a difficult choice between preventing a corporate debt crisis-and a potential surge in unemployment-and not supporting "zombie" firms that are unsustainable and will stymie future economic growth.
The public debt accrued during the coronavirus crisis will be substantial, well above levels achieved after 2008, and debt/GDP ratios will be much higher as well. In addition to funds already pledged for relief, governments will probably need to engage in further demand-side stimulus once the acute phase of the crisis has passed-probably later this year. Even if funding conditions are favourable for governments and corporates, they will still weigh on balance sheets. Actions to preserve economic activity during the crisis have been enacted largely without regard to the fiscal impact, but Keynesian fiscal stimulus in the second half of the year will be easier to contemplate for countries that had more fiscal space going into the crisis.
In the light of the populist backlash against austerity that followed the 2008-09 crisis, governments are all too aware that it would be politically costly to return to austerity. Furthermore, central banks' actions in recent weeks have normalised previously unthinkable levels of monetary-fiscal co-operation. As a result of these political and economic forces, a return to "normal" (involving shrinking central bank balance sheets or higher interest rates) now appears impossible. We expect that the role of central banks in backstopping government debt to continue in the medium term. More broadly, in the EU and the UK higher debt levels underpinned by low interest rates will become the new normal for the 2020s.

Monetary policy in the euro zone had already become much more accommodative from September 2019, when the ECB launched an open-ended quantitative easing programme (QE2) at a monthly EUR20bn and lowered the deposit rate to -0.5%. However, in response to the coronavirus crisis, the ECB has extended its anti-crisis policy tools.
Among the most effective is the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), designed to be temporary and flexible, allowing the ECB to expand its sovereign bond holdings, front load purchases and take more risk on to its balance sheet (by buying short-term corporate debt of sufficient quality and Greek government bonds). Starting with an initial size of EUR750bn, the PEPP was then increased to EUR1.35trn (10% of euro zone GDP) and extended until mid-2021. The ECB has also preserved an ample degree of liquidity in the banking system. First, it made some refinancing operations cheaper-the interest rate for longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) was lowered to -1%-and others more accessible for non-bank financial intermediaries. Second, it eased the rules around the collateral that banks can use in exchange for central bank liquidity, effectively preventing a wave of asset-price devaluations from constraining bank lending to the economy.
At its current pace of EUR30bn per week, PEPP will be exhausted by February 2021. The ECB may slow the rate of purchases, but it may also increase the size of the programme once again. Other options on the table for the ECB involve incorporating high-yield debt into its asset purchases or cutting its deposit rate further, from -0.5% currently (especially given the recent appreciation of the euro). Overall, the ECB is strongly committed to preventing financial fragmentation in euro zone funding costs, which minimises the risk of a sovereign debt crisis in highly leveraged economies. Its willingness to act as a lender of last resort dates back to 2012, when the then president, Mario Draghi, vowed to do "whatever it takes" to preserve the currency union. The ECB will continue to play a major supportive role, but the size of the crisis requires large-scale fiscal intervention by governments and EU-led regional transfers. Political and legal risks stemming from conservative German opponents of the ECB's actions are significant, but do not represent an immediate threat to monetary policy.
The coronavirus has exposed the limits of monetary policy in the context of an ultra-low interest rate environment. However, central banks have pursued non-conventional measures aimed at ensuring adequate liquidity in response to the crisis. Central banks in advanced economies already had interest rates at, or close to, zero. Other banks, including the Bank of England (BoE, the central bank), have cut their rates to zero, in effect exhausting their interest-rate tool. Central banks' primary policy objective now is to step up their role as the buyer of last resort for government and corporate debt. This will allow fiscal policy to expand as necessary to backstop businesses-and households-for as long as quarantines and lockdowns persist, and at the same time to prevent a spike in interest rates that would normally accompany this level of spending. The BoE announced massive government and corporate bond-buying schemes, of £200bn, to facilitate this.
The euro will remain weak until the end of 2021 The euro:US dollar exchange rate has been volatile since February. Growing concerns about the economic prospects of euro zone countries caused the euro to fall below US$1.1:EUR1 between mid-March, when many European governments started to impose lockdowns, and mid-May. The euro recovered in the second half of May, after the French and German governments put forward a proposal to issue EU debt up to EUR500bn and use that money to support the most-affected member states via grants. The euro strengthened further on the back of additional monetary stimulus by the ECB, which boosted investors' confidence by increasing the volume of asset purchases under its pandemic emergency purchase programme to EUR1.35trn (US$1.52trn). The euro is likely to firm slightly against the US dollar in the second half of the year, but we do not expect a sustained recovery in the European currency before 2022.
Brexit and weak fundamentals will hold back the sterling over the medium term The British pound experienced high volatility in March as the global run on the US dollar caused it to fall by more than 12% against the US currency, to its lowest level in 35 years. Although it partly recovered in April, its value over the short term will remain sensitive to concerns about the impact of the coronavirus on the domestic economy and to developments in EU-UK trade negotiations, and it will remain volatile in 2020-21. From 2022 onwards the pound will appreciate gradually against major currencies, but its value over the medium term will be held back by weak fundamentals. These include a large current-account deficit, which implies vulnerability to external funding conditions, and the UK's withdrawal from the EU, which led to a structural decline in the underlying value of the currency.
Turkey faces a risk of another sharp depreciation of the lira The Central Bank of Turkey in April 2020 slashed its main policy rate by a total of 1,525 basis points, to 8.75%. On May 21st it slashed rates by a further 50 basis points, to 8.25%. This dovish bias reflects political pressure to lower interest rates. Inflation is relatively high, which has pushed real policy rates deep into negative territory. The recent interest-rate cuts have put substantial downside pressure on the lira. We expect lira volatility to continue in the remainder of this year, leading to a nominal depreciation of 19.8%, to TL7.07:US$1 on average and TL7.75:US$1 at the end of the year. Our bearish outlook for the lira is a result of a combination of factors, including deep negative real interest rates, a wide fiscal and current-account deficit, continued credit expansion and the central bank's dovish bias.
Russia is operating an accommodative monetary policy to counter the crisis The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) cut its main policy rate-the one-week repurchase (repo) rate-by 50 basis points, to 5.5%, on April 24th. This was the seventh consecutive rate cut since June 2019, bringing the total to 225 basis points. We expect additional 50-basis-point cuts to 5% by end-2020. However, we believe that the CBR will refrain from cutting rates too aggressively as positive real rates will be critical to support the rouble. The CBR has played a crucial role in stabilising the rouble since March. In March-May the CBR sold about US$6.5bn to support the rouble. The currency depreciated by 23% from January 1st to March 21st, to Rb80:US$1, but has been on an appreciatory trend since. By early June the rouble had dipped back to under Rb70:US$1, largely because of the CBR and Ministry of Finance's foreign-currency sales, but also because of Russia's robust fiscal backdrop and real positive yields, making Russian assets attractive to foreign investors. We forecast that the rouble will average Rb71.3:US$1 in 2020, a 9.2% annual depreciation against the dollar.
Currencies risk in eastern Europe has risen in the wake of the crisis Macroeconomic risks for much of eastern Europe are firmly tilted to the downside. With the exception of the Baltics, Slovakia and Slovenia-all of which use the euro-increased exchange-rate volatility in the light of deeply negative interest rates will burden countries with large external debt overhangs. External debt ratios are particularly high in Kazakhstan, Croatia and Ukraine, exposing them to currency depreciation and rising borrowing costs. Currency weakness combined with wide current-account deficits in Kazakhstan, Romania and Serbia raises the risk of balance-of-payments crises. Fiscal deficits are expansive in Romania, Turkey and Ukraine; Croatia and Hungary exhibit high public debt levels, weakening their ability to implement large-scale stimulus measures. With the exception of Russia, all countries in the region have negative net international investment positions, making them more vulnerable to sudden portfolio outflows.

The coronavirus will result in a sharp economic contraction in 2020 Europe is heading for a historic recession, with both production and consumption collapsing in the first half of 2020 as a consequence of the pandemic and containment measures. We expect Italy and Spain to see the deepest contractions in western Europe, given their heavy caseloads and comparatively long and strict lockdowns. We forecast a bounce-back from the third quarter, but this will reflect base effects rather than a robust return of economic activity. Global supply chains will remain disrupted, unemployment and business failures will continue to rise and consumers will remain cautious. Southern Europe, which depends on tourism, will struggle for longer as quarantines and weak confidence hold back holidaymakers.

Growth rates will pick up in 2021, but will still only allow a partial recovery: we forecast that GDP in western Europe will not return to its 2019 level until 2023. This is a noticeably slower trajectory than the one we expect in the US, reflecting greater dependence on global export demand and a slower structural adjustment in the wake of the crisis (reflecting a reliance on furlough schemes in addition to unemployment benefits). Variations across the bloc will be determined by fiscal starting positions. Germany has presented the largest fiscal assistance plans in the EU and accounts for almost half of emergency state aid packages in the bloc (the European Commission's fiscal and state aid rules have been temporarily relaxed). Italy, by contrast, has much less fiscal room and higher financing costs, and is struggling to channel fiscal support efficiently to recipients. UK growth was already slowing in 2018-19, but the coronavirus crisis will cause a severe contraction in 2020, when we forecast that real GDP will contract by 8.7%. Brexit uncertainty is likely to slow the recovery in 2021.
Economic resilience to the crisis diverges across eastern Europe The countries of eastern Europe that implemented strict containment measures at an early stage (such as the Czech Republic and Poland) registered comparatively few cases and will make a faster economic recovery than western Europe. However, this recovery will be limited by these countries' dependence on export demand. From 2021 they may benefit from some "near-shoring" of supply chains as west European manufacturers look to reduce their reliance on China. Some countries (such as Romania) have experienced reverse migration, which could also provide an economic boost.
In contrast, the countries that initially downplayed the threat of the virus (such as Russia and Turkey) have had more severe outbreaks and will recover more slowly. We forecast that real GDP in Turkey will contract by 5.9% in 2020, which would be a worse recession than that following the global financial crisis, before rebounding by 4.3% year-on-year in 2021; but we project that real GDP will surpass its fourth-quarter 2019 level only by end-2022. Oil producers such as Russia will also struggle with low oil prices and low demand from western Europe, raising financial stability risks. Russia's economy will endure a deep recession in 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic is weighing heavily on the local economy and external demand for crude oil. However, after an initial tepid government response, fiscal policy is turning more supportive.
Faced with high external debt obligations and wide fiscal and current-account deficits, many non-EU countries in the region are turning to the IMF for emergency support. The poor economic outlook warrants aggressive monetary policy responses, but the available monetary policy tool kits differ across the region. Most EU members are able to resort to unconventional easing measures, but most countries in south-east Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) that have less policy credibility or are prone to inflation will refrain from using unorthodox tools.

Consumer price inflation in the euro area will be dampened in 2020 by the oil price crash in mid-March (we now expect Brent crude to average US$38.1/barrel this year, with a risk that it will go much lower), and the hit to demand from the coronavirus and associated containment measures. This will be offset only slightly by shortages resulting from supply-chain bottlenecks and a surge in demand for some goods, such as medical supplies. We expect annual inflation to remain subdued in 2020, with inflation strengthening gradually from 2021 as economic activity recovers, and further supported from 2022 by a rise in oil prices. We forecast an annual average inflation rate of about 1.5% in 2021-24.
Inflation across eastern Europe has, in general, been muted in recent years, despite relatively strong macroeconomic backdrops. In commodity-dependent Central Asia and Russia, inflation has been higher, reflecting the cyclicality of global oil prices and exchange-rate movements. Turkey is an outlier in the region and tends to have higher inflation because of the Central Bank of Turkey's dovish bias, a steadily weakening currency and an economic structure that is dependent on rapid credit expansion for growth. Supply-side disinflation from low commodity prices and muted domestic demand will suppress price pressures in 2020. This means that deflationary pressures will be notable across eastern Europe in the coming months, similar to in 2015-16, after the previous oil price crash and weak economic growth. However, the coronavirus crisis has resulted in a synchronised monetary easing cycle across eastern Europe (except in some Central Asian economies), despite most local currencies experiencing sharp depreciations against the US dollar and euro. As a result, unconventional monetary policies and large fiscal-stimulus programmes, together with disrupted supply chains and possibly a quick recovery in household demand towards the end of the year, could fuel inflationary pressures later on.

Business environment rankings cover 82 countries The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings model seeks to measure the attractiveness of a country's business environment and its major components. The model's assessment of the business environment-based on the opportunities for and hindrances to the conduct of business-enables us to rank each of the 82 countries covered on its overall position and in each of 11 categories on a global and a regional basis. The model uses quantitative data and expert assessments to measure the attractiveness of countries' business environments. The framework has been designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies in formulating their global business strategies and investment location decisions. The overall scores (on a 1-10 scale) and rankings are based on scores for 91 indicators, grouped into a total of 11 categories.
The negative economic fallout from government measures to mitigate the coronavirus pandemic will become clear in coming quarters and is likely to result in a deterioration in business environments in most European countries in the forecast period (2020-24), especially in the first few years, compared with the historical period (2015-19). This will reverse the improvements made during the post-2009 crisis period. Apart from having a negative impact on macroeconomic policy and market opportunities, the pandemic is likely to have far-reaching implications for policy toward private enterprise and competition, trade and investment policies, taxation, labour markets and infrastructure.
Western Europe is ranked second globally out of six regions, after North America, and eastern Europe is ranked fourth, after North America, western Europe, and Asia and Australasia, but ahead of Latin America and the Middle East and Africa.
EU countries and Nordics score particularly well in our rankings EU countries remain well represented in the top 20 of our global rankings. Two non-EU countries, Switzerland and Norway, also occupy leading positions. The large number of countries in western Europe in the top 20 reflects the high degree of political stability in the region (social and political tensions notwithstanding), large and competitive domestic markets and a strong degree of openness to world trade. Although we continue to highlight the risks of political fragmentation and rising anti-establishment sentiment, we do not forecast a marked anti-market backlash in policy choices.
Business environment in eastern Europe has improved since 1990s The investment climate of central and eastern Europe has improved considerably in recent years. The early reformers among the countries of central Europe led the way in the early 1990s in adopting far-reaching stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation programmes. Reform in the Balkans has been much more uneven and subject to periodic reversals, but significant progress has been made even there. Factors such as a low-cost, but well-qualified, labour force, proximity to developed markets, and, in some cases, ample natural-resource endowments have attracted considerable foreign direct investment to the region over the past decade. However, many east European countries still face fundamental reform challenges, including high levels of emigration, a declining workforce and a high social security burden. Meeting those challenges will test already fraying relations between governments and electorates, and heighten the risk of political instability and social unrest.
The outlook for the business environment in the countries of the former Soviet Union is mixed. Throughout the region, the barriers to enacting wide-ranging reform remain formidable. In Russia, the business environment has suffered as a result of Western sanctions and a rise in tariff and non-tariff barriers. There is little evidence that the Russian government intends to undertake disruptive structural reform to improve the dynamism of the economy. However, low energy prices have prompted some regional commodity exporters, notably Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, to seek to open up and diversify their economies.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2015-19) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2020-24). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2015-19. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2020-24 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2015-19 ranges are then used to derive 2020-24 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2020-24, not to the likely situation in 2024 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2017 or 2022). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - Ahead of the general election in February 2021, the centre-left president, Lenín Moreno, will struggle to manage the fallout from languishing global oil prices and the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Mr Moreno's administration will seek to stabilise the public finances and pursue reforms under the auspices of the IMF. Fiscal prudence amid a harsh recession will significantly raise the risks of political instability and social unrest. Although The Economist Intelligence Unit currently expects a centrist candidate to win the presidency, the outlook is highly nebulous, partly owing to the fallout from the pandemic. Our election forecast is underpinned by our view that there is insufficient support for a far-left government to win, even in a second-round run-off. However, worsening economic conditions raise the risk of a populist government winning. Regardless of the outcome, sizeable barriers to governability and stability will persist, considering the highly fragmented political landscape.

- Some improvements in the business environment have begun to materialise since a shift to a more market-friendly government in recent years, particularly in terms of official policy towards foreign investment and private enterprise. However, economic volatility on the back of the coronavirus pandemic and political instability will force the government to back-pedal in some areas, hampering the overall pace of improvement. Structural impedi-ments, such as inadequate access to local finance and the small market size, will remain difficult to tackle. We assume that the next administration will retain broadly similar policies, but political risk remains elevated, and there is a possibility of policy reversals. The risk of a disorderly debt default will also constrain investment in the near term.

- The coronavirus crisis will pummel Ecuador's state finances and engender a severe recession that will weigh heavily on the economic outlook in the forecast period (2020-24). A retrenchment in public spending to stabilise government finances will feed through indirectly to private consumption, which will be hindered by a deterioration of the labour market. Even assuming that the virus is contained and that domestic and global economic conditions improve, the medium-term economic recovery will be sluggish. Dollarisation provides a basis for macroeconomic stability, but absent significant improvements to the business environment, a more robust economic trajectory is unlikely.

- A falling birth rate is contributing to slower population growth, but at an annual average rate of 1.3% per year in 2020-24, Ecuador's population growth will be on a par with that of its Andean neighbours. In this period the growth of the labour force will exceed that of the country's overall population and the labour force growth of more advanced countries, giving rise to a demographic dividend that could provide some upside to convergence with more developed economies in the region.

- Ecuador is one of the smallest markets in our business environment rankings. We expect the domestic market to grow only sluggishly after 2020. Significant mineral reserves will attract oil and mining investors, but opportunities outside these sectors will remain restricted by low purchasing power measured in terms of GDP per head. Persistent income inequality and poverty will hinder robust growth in household consumption.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.

- Low levels of productivity and a wealth of natural resources offer scope for Ecuador to catch up with more developed countries, provided that policies are implemented to transform its resource wealth into productive investment in other sectors. Ecuador will benefit from dollarisation and incremental improve-ments to the business environment. However, poor prospects for significant improvements to institutions do not bode well for a more stable economic policy direction. Assuming persistent structural deficiencies and inconsistent policymaking decisions, we forecast that long-term investment will be lacking and that income levels will continue to trail OECD levels in the long term.

Background: Ecuador restored its presidential democracy in 1979, but its institutions remain fragile. External economic shocks have contributed to the ousting of three presidents by popular protest since 1997. The current president, Lenín Moreno, took office in May 2017, succeeding Rafael Correa (2007-17)-the longest-serving president in Ecuadorean history. In February 2018 a series of constitutional reforms introduced by Mr Moreno (including the reintroduction of a two-term limit for the presidency) were approved by referendum. Although this was a step towards deeper democratisation, persistent social and fiscal challenges will continue to weigh on governability.
Political structure: The 2008 constitution increased executive power, but has done little to foster institutional capacity to tackle problems such as a politicised judiciary, powerful business lobbies, and mobilised grassroots and indigenous groups. The political system is fragmented. Mr Moreno retains strong executive powers, but his party, Alianza País, lost considerable standing after it splintered following the results of the 2018 referendum.
Policy issues: Dollarisation has provided macroeconomic stability but exposed Ecuador's underlying lack of competitive-ness. Modest oil prices during the 2020-24 forecast period, relative to the previous decade, have necessitated fiscal adjustments. The Moreno administration secured a three-year IMF agreement-along with other multilateral financing-in March 2019 to meet various objectives, including putting the public finances on a sustainable trajectory, but programme performance has been lacking. The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic will further complicate the government's reform agenda, especially given the lack of fiscal space to counter the hit to the economy and financial system.
Taxation: Taxes have been subject to frequent changes. The main taxes in Ecuador are income tax, levied at rates of up to 35%, and value-added tax (VAT), levied at 12%. Private firms must distribute 15% of their profits among their employees.
Foreign trade: Ecuador recorded a trade surplus of US$1bn in 2019; petrol export earnings averaged 39% of total export revenue, compared with over 50% during the commodity boom in the 2000s.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Ecuador has a multi-party democracy. The centre-left president, Lenín Moreno of Alianza País (AP), took office in May 2017 for a four-year term (ending in May 2021), after winning a run-off vote against Guillermo Lasso of the centre-right Creando Oportunidades (Creo). AP had a legislative majority at the onset of Mr Moreno's term, but following a power clash with his predecessor, Rafael Correa (2007-17), the party split in 2018, with Mr Correa's supporters forming a new political bloc, Revolución Ciudadana (RC), which has not yet secured official registration as a political party. Lacking a majority, Mr Moreno counts on support from opposition parties on a piecemeal basis.
Cross-party support is difficult to achieve, however, considering that the political party landscape system is fragmented and fluid. In mid-2019 the biennial reorganisation of the National Assembly gave rise to a novel legislative pact between the AP, Creo and two blocs consisting of legislators from smaller parties, but this fell apart in early 2020 following disagreements between Creo and the AP. Ahead of elections in February 2021 the RC and the conservative Partido Social Cristiano (PSC) will be highly obstructive. However, in the redistribution of legislative committees last May the RC was removed from the Consejo de Administración Legislativa (the legislative administrative committee, a powerful panel that vets incoming legislation), preventing the party from presiding over any legislative panel and thereby curtailing Mr Correa's influence in Congress.

Political outlook: Political stability The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic presents Mr Moreno with two immense challenges before his term ends in May 2021. First, his administration must manage the current health crisis with limited resources. Despite the swift imposition (in mid-March) of strict national lockdown measures, including a daily curfew from 2pm to 5am, the virus has spread rapidly, with more than 37,355 cases reported as at May 25th. A gradual, region-by-region easing of restrictions began on May 4th, but the process will be slow and will raise the risk of a second wave of infections.
The president's second challenge is to stabilise the economy as oil prices languish, lockdown measures stifle activity and external demand shrinks. With no fiscal space to mount a countercyclical response (Mr Moreno has announced aggressive cuts to public spending), the political opposition will be emboldened and the risk of social unrest will be significantly heightened.
These immense challenges will prove awkward for the president to overcome. His party, AP, has 42 seats in the legislature, 27 short of the threshold for a majority. Considering that a general election is approaching (due in February 2021) and that the government is implementing austerity measures amid a crisis, the opposition will offer limited support, and some members of Mr Moreno's party will be reluctant to support his policies. The conservative PSC and the left-wing RC, the faction loyal to Mr Correa, will be overtly obstructionist. Mr Moreno's popularity will provide little upside; his approval rating stood at 14.7% in May, down from 24.7% a year earlier.
Despite this-and although political jockeying will be a constant undercurrent as elections draw near-The Economist Intelligence Unit expects cross-party support for some government policies to materialise. In particular, the conservative Creo may yet extend further support to the government, as it did in mid-May, after Mr Moreno abandoned plans to raise taxes as part of the government's emergency economic legislation. However, even assuming that the government secures enough support to facilitate policymaking, political uncertainties will prevail (rather than dissipate) in the short to medium term, as the economy enters a sharp recession.
There is a high probability that protests will occur in the next few months. Informal employment as a percentage of total non-agricultural employment is over 60%, and there is little relief coming from the government, which does not have the fiscal capacity to help to offset losses faced by informal workers, let alone formal businesses. Austerity measures on top of the worsening economic conditions will amplify the likelihood of unrest. In particular, labour unions and indigenous groups, including the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE), which was largely responsible for intense protests in October 2019, will pressure the government to change course.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Deeply politicised institutions, an inefficient bureaucracy, a complex and archaic tax system, and corruption have long undermined institutional effectiveness. Although the former administration (led by Mr Correa) initially increased government effectiveness by allowing the executive to bypass a deeply fragmented legislature, Mr Correa's constitutional amendments in 2008 and 2015 tilted discretional power in the executive's favour, reducing accountability.
Mr Moreno has made moderate progress in addressing institutional weaknesses. The 2018 referendum enabled him to restructure the judicial appointment process, introduce term limits for the executive, enact stricter penalties for corruption, move to rationalise real-estate taxation and introduce market-friendly regulations regarding mining investment. Challenges to greater political and institutional effectiveness remain, however; bureaucratic inefficiencies persist, governability is weak and lawmaking is subject to the demands of an array of vested interests, while enforcement is inadequate. These obstacles will be compounded by risks of social unrest. Social groups have the ability to effectively veto government policy, as evidenced by indigenous groups' ousting of three presidents in the run-up to Mr Correa's presidency and, more recently, in the widespread unrest in October 2019 that forced the government to reverse its elimination of fuel subsidies.
Deep-rooted institutional shortcomings will remain a hindrance Since taking office in 2017 Mr Moreno has attempted to remove political interference from the judiciary and curb graft. Results have been mixed. Mr Moreno successfully installed a new panel of judges to the Constitutional Court after the previous court was terminated amid a cloud of allegations of wrongdoing; investigations into alleged malfeasance (including money laundering and other financial crimes) intensified the court's already poor reputational standing due to perceptions of favouritism towards the incumbent political leadership. Nonetheless, inefficiency and corruption remain deeply rooted in the judicial system. The Council of the Judiciary has shown little progress in handling corruption cases, access to legal protection and law enforcement remains flawed, and the lack of effective protection of rights persists.
Although Ecuador has historically had a relatively low crime rate, the security environment has deteriorated over the past decade. There is little chance of marked improvement unless measures are adopted to advance the competence and effectiveness of law-enforcement agencies. There are no home-grown terrorist organisations, but violence has spilled over from Colombia owing to a rise in drug trafficking and related money laundering by groups of dissident guerrillas from the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), who oppose the peace deal signed in 2016 with the Colombian government. Mr Moreno has bolstered Ecuador's existing international security co-operation efforts, through closer co-operation with the US, as well as organisations such as Interpol and the Financial Action Task Force of Latin America (a regional financial intelligence and anti-money laundering network). However, anti-corruption initiatives have yielded few tangible results. Mr Moreno-and the government that takes over in May 2021-will struggle to make sweeping progress in combating pervasive corruption, which will continue to weigh on political effectiveness.
Political outlook: Election watch The February 2021 general election outlook is highly nebulous at this stage, owing to obscurity caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Notwithstanding uncertainties, we do not expect any party to garner 50% of the first-round vote, or secure 40% with a 10-percentage-point margin of victory over its rivals, which it would need to secure the presidency without a run-off. Mr Moreno has signalled that he does not intend to run. Given his government's commitment to unpopular economic measures and his low approval rating, it is unlikely that a member of his centre-left AP would secure enough support to win outright. A first-round victory for Mr Lasso (the leader of Creo) or for candidates from the PSC or RC is equally unlikely, considering the fractured nature of the political landscape. However, as Mr Correa has the enduring support of about 20% of the electorate, a candidate backed by him (probably from the RC) is likely to play a significant role and reach the second round.
In the event of a second round, we believe that a candidate pursuing broadly centrist economic policies would be most likely to take the presidency. Although a Correa-backed candidate would be well poised to reach the second round, factors (most notably corruption) weigh on Mr Correa's appeal; the former president was sentenced to eight years in prison on bribery charges in April. Meanwhile, the PSC performed well in municipal elections in March 2019, and the appeal of Creo may grow as the party attempts to improve its image through a renewed focus on governance. The vice-president, Otto Sonnenholzner of the AP, may also run, having risen to prominence through his role in spearheading the government's pandemic response. A deepening of the economic crisis-leading to political instability-is a major risk to our outlook.
Political outlook: International relations In the short term, the coronavirus pandemic will encumber Mr Moreno's liberalising trade agenda. We expect limited progress on free-trade agreement (FTA) discussions with the US and on Ecuador's accession to the Pacific Alliance (a regional trade bloc) for the remainder of his presidency. The absence of an existing bilateral agreement with Mexico will present a challenge beyond the near term; before the crisis the two parties ambitiously set February 7th 2021 (the date of general election in Ecuador) as the deadline for an FTA. This appears increasingly unfeasible, and the chances of Ecuador entering the bloc by 2024 have declined considerably, despite support from the presidents in the Alliance and Mexico's foreign minister. In addition to the pandemic, changes in government and policy direction may hinder the accession process.

Ecuador scores poorly in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings and-despite moderate improvements in the country's underlying score and in its global and regional positions-it will remain towards the bottom of our global rankings (67th out of 82 countries) in the 2020-24 forecast period. The improvements mainly relate to changes introduced by the president, Lenín Moreno. His policy stance has proven notably more market-friendly than that of his predecessor, Rafael Correa (2007-17). Although Mr Correa was only in office for the first half of the 2015-19 historical period, it took time for Mr Moreno to reorientate policy away from that of his predecessor, explaining why the average score for 2015-19 remains weak.
The main categories in which Ecuador sees the most marked improvements are those related to government policy; the country's global ranking rises for policy towards private enterprise and competition, foreign investment and taxes. However, further progress (and a sharper improvement in the country's rankings) will be hampered by the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and a collapse in global oil prices, which will impair the economy severely, deepen political divisions and fuel social unrest. Against this backdrop, measures to foster competition, improve the country's regulatory framework and lift foreign investment will take a back seat.
Our forecasts are based on the assumption that the next administration, which will take office in May 2021, retains a broadly similar policy stance to the current government, thereby preserving the gains that Mr Moreno has made in terms of shifting policy away from a state-led development model. However, the outcome of next year's election remains extremely unclear at this early stage; if a more populist administration takes office (a high risk considering the harsh recession this year), policy orientation could alter more radically, prompting a downgrade in the business environment rankings. Regardless of who wins the election, the business environment's long-running structural weaknesses-including the small size of the market, financing constraints and difficulties arising from bloated government bureaucracy-will continue to weigh heavily on Ecuador's investment climate.

Ecuador's score for the macroeconomic environment category-its strongest area of the business environment by some distance-will remain stable in the forecast period, although its global ranking slips by seven places, to 32nd. However, the country's score is flattered by dollarisation, which keeps inflation low, reduces the risk of periods of sharp currency volatility and reduces (but does not eliminate) the risk of a balance-of-payments crisis. Other areas of the macroeconomic environment, including the quality of official policymaking and strength of economic institutions, score much more poorly. The public finances are also a weak area; large fiscal deficits have resulted in a sharp rise in public debt in recent years, during which time real GDP has either registered low growth or has contracted.
Almost all major performance indicators will weaken, at least during the first half of 2020-24. We expect Ecuador's recession in 2020 to be one of the deepest of all Latin American economies, as the already difficult situation before the coronavirus pandemic reduces the policy levers available to the authorities to cushion the impact of weaker domestic and external demand. Tighter fiscal policy management will fail to prevent a sharp widening of the budget deficit and a further rise in public debt levels, and the current-account deficit is also likely to widen. Financing needs will rise sharply in 2020, highlighting the government's limited access to external sources of finance. We assume that the government's efforts to improve the transparency of the public finances and bolster its fiscal framework will help to secure greater multilateral support, but it is likely to need to reach a restructuring agreement with creditors to avoid a disorderly debt default.
The recovery from the coronavirus-induced recession will be slow and gradual. Oil prices are likely to remain modest in 2020-24 (we forecast that West Texas Intermediate prices, a proxy for Ecuadorean oil export prices, will recover from an average of US$32.2/barrel in 2020 to US$36.5/b in 2021, before averaging US$54.2/b in 2022-24), and production volumes are set to rise only marginally. Likely fiscal retrenchment will hamper the pace of economic recovery. More dynamic overall GDP growth would require faster sustainable rates of growth in non-oil sectors. In turn, this would require greater legal stability and improvements in the regulatory environment, as well as expanded access to foreign markets. Investment and structural reforms in electricity, telecoms and fuel refining would also be needed to reduce the cost of these goods and services to competitive levels. Few of these developments appear likely to materialise in 2020-24.
Business environment outlook: Ecuador's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: Fuel subsidies are partially lifted. Implementation of anti-trust policies is subject to politicisation. Select industries (such as mining) benefit from policies promoting supply-side growth.
2022-24: Government continues to scale back state's role in development. Nonetheless, regulation and licensing continue to favour state-run companies over private-sector firms. A new public-private partnership model is trialled.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Overtures to foreign firms and pro-business reforms partly offset the government's continual interventionism.
2022-24: Inadequate property rights protection and questions regarding access to foreign arbitration deter investment. New mining projects attract investment.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: Government maintains capital outflows tax and increases import tariffs to protect dollarisation. Efforts to pursue free-trade agreements (FTAs) flounder amid a collapse in global trade and growing protectionism by major trading partners.
2022-24: Supply-side reforms enhance national competitiveness and government begins to phase out capital outflows tax.
Taxes 2020-21: Government implements tax reform to expand tax base and improve collection. Certain exemptions are eliminated, and other burdensome regulations are simplified.
2022-24: Efforts to increase tax collection and tackle tax evasion continue, supporting revenue growth. Tax system remains complex.
Financing 2020-21: Deposit and credit growth weaken amid sharp economic recession, raising risks to banking sector stability.
2022-24: Financing is still below potential, as public-financing needs curb growth of long-term lending to private sector.
The labour market 2020-21: Government takes steps to reduce public wage bill and reduce labour market rigidities.
2022-24: Quality of workforce remains poor. Labour reforms are slow to take effect. Educational outcomes remain weak.
Infrastructure 2020-21: Fiscal constraints lead to cancellation of several projects. Efforts to drum up large-scale foreign investment achieve little success.
2022-24: Renewed interest in port and airport development sustains new cycle of investment.
Technological readiness 2020-21: Investment to expand fourth-generation (4G) broadband availability.
2022-24: Increasing adoption of civic technologies by government. Fifth-generation (5G) technology remains in its infancy.

Ecuador's score and ranking for policy towards private enterprise and competition improve in the 2020-24 forecast period. The moderate improvements reflect Mr Moreno's efforts to shift policy orientation away from a preference for creating or developing state-owned companies in favour of development led by private investment. A full reversal of state ownership is not in prospect, but there has been an increase in the scope for private-sector participation in some regulated sectors of the economy, including infrastructure and mining. However, a deeper liberalisation of policy towards private enterprise and competition is unlikely; monopolies and oligopolies will remain features of Ecuador's business environment, particularly in some sectors (such as the cement, financial, supermarket and steel industries). Although some modest reform progress has been achieved, further progress is unlikely until the coronavirus pandemic has eased. As such, high levels of bureaucracy will continue to constrain private investment and competition in 2020-24.
Price controls persist as government seeks to ease fuel subsidy burden
- Certain goods and services-such as electric power, agricultural chemicals, pharmaceuticals and telephone tariffs-are subject to government price controls. Limited price controls for some basic foodstuffs also exist. However, government subsidies for fuel have proven particularly costly, with the 2020 budget ring-fencing just under US$2bn for these. Mr Moreno has sought to scale back these subsidies but has faced opposition from lawmakers, business interests and the general public. In October 2019 Mr Moreno implemented an executive decree ending fuel subsidies in an effort to help the government to meet its IMF-mandated fiscal targets. However, the move prompted sharp increases in retail petrol prices and caused intense social unrest in Quito, the capital, forcing the administration to withdraw the reform just ten days later. In May, amid the collapse in global oil prices, the government revisited efforts to reduce fuel subsidies, on the basis that a shift in the subsidy regime would not result in a sharp hike in retail petrol prices. The new regime will take effect in July; the authorities will set retail petrol prices, with retailers allowed to sell fuel within 5% of this fixed rate. The rate will be determined by global prices and will reduce the burden of subsidies on state finances. As global market prices remain low, domestic resistance will be less marked than in October 2019, but there could be much more significant public opposition once global prices increase more noticeably (from 2022).
- Although the government has indicated that it is considering welcoming foreign concessions in some state companies, we do not expect any significant moves towards the full (or even partial) privatisation of state-run assets in the forecast period. The main area identified so far by the government is the Corporación Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (CNT, the state-owned telecoms company); in early 2019 the authorities stated that they were looking to launch a tender for a 20-year concession licence to operate CNT, targeting a completion date of the end of that year. The goal is for the state to retain ownership of the company while receiving US$4bn from the investor over the licence period in exchange for operating rights. However, as at May 2020 the tender had not been launched and, given the broader uncertainty amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has sent the country's risk premium skyrocketing, the sale of the concession is highly unlikely, at least in 2020-21. The government has indicated that it is considering the sale of other concessions, including the Sopladora hydroelectric complex and Banco del Pacífico (a state bank); we remain similarly sceptical that these will materialise in the near term. Even assuming that the economy stabilises in the wake of the pandemic, there will be significant public opposition to the sale of stakes in state assets. Moreover, it is unclear whether significant demand exists, as foreign firms may be deterred by mismanagement of state-run companies in recent years, as well as the fact that many lack fully audited accounts (which will complicate estimates of market value).
- The government is pushing for all major infrastructure projects to be developed with private-sector investment, primarily using public-private partnership (PPP) agreements The current PPP legislative framework is based on the Regulations for the Public-Private Partnership Regime, the Law of Incentives for PPPs and Foreign Investment, and the General Regulations for the Application of the Framework Law of Incentives for PPPs and Foreign Investment. These were all introduced in 2015-16 and essentially consist of tax breaks-including breaks from import tariffs and value-added tax (VAT) during project construction-as well as a ten-year reprieve from income tax and a reprieve from tax on the repatriation of profits. However, shaky investor confidence will hamper the uptake of PPPs in the near term, and institutional barriers will remain a structural constraint in the medium term. A lack of staff with necessary resources to promote and support PPP development will constrain international interest in potential projects, and ongoing legal insecurity will also remain a cause for concern for investors.

Interventionism and a burdensome bureaucracy will persist Ecuador's score for policy towards foreign investment improves firmly in the 2020-24 period, and its position in the global ranking rises from 73rd to 57th. The Moreno government has proven much more willing to engage with foreign investors than its predecessor; it has launched a vigorous drive against wide-spread corruption in government and private business, and has adopted investor-friendly legislation. Broadly speaking, government commitment to crafting policy that provides transparency, clarity and predictability to foreign investors will be moderately stronger in 2020-24 than in 2015-19. However, securing legislative support for deeper structural reforms to improve the business environment is unlikely in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. Ecuador's still relatively weak ranking reflects the likelihood of ongoing government intervention in major sectors, powerful domestic vested interests that will resist some of the government's reform efforts and a weak legal framework. There are risks to the score, particularly if a less market-friendly administration takes office in 2021, or if there is a messy external debt default.

- The state's still considerable role in the economy-combined with a preference for domestic over foreign investment and frequent changes to laws-fostered general uncertainty regarding the security of foreign investments and contractual agreements in the country, particularly under Mr Correa. Under Mr Moreno, the promotion of foreign investment has been much more noticeable, driven in large part by economic expediency. In 2018 legislation came into force that stipulates that disputes over investment agreements must be resolved through arbitration. Even international arbitral decisions are now deemed immediately enforceable in Ecuador, without the need for any further approval by domestic courts. Nevertheless, investors will remain wary regarding judicial security, as the situation could change quickly under a different government. Under Mr Correa Ecuador faced a number of claims at the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) relating to legal disputes between the government and foreign companies; the proceedings dragged on for several years and most cases have only recently been concluded.

Ecuador's economy has traditionally been one of the more open in the region, but foreign trade as a share of GDP fell from close to 70% in 2006 to about 47% in 2019, owing to repeated import and capital-account restrictions, as well as shifts in the government's stance on trade openness. Ecuador's underlying score will inch up only marginally in the forecast period, but its global and regional rankings will both slip. Efforts to diversify export markets to Asia, and to Europe through a free-trade agreement (FTA), have made limited progress and will flounder as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which will lead to an abrupt fall in global trade flows and spark a growth in protectionism. Ecuador is seeking to join the Pacific Alliance (an integration project that includes Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico) and to sign an FTA with Mexico, but the pandemic is likely to delay both developments. Sporadic trade spats with regional partners are likely to continue, dragging down Ecuador's score in this area.

- Ecuador's trade integration with the US, its biggest export partner, will remain adversely affected by Ecuador's unilateral decision in 2013 to withdraw from the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA). ATPDEA was an agreement that granted tariff-free access to the US market for about 6,000 goods. The government failed to secure an alternative trade agreement, forcing many non-traditional sectors (such as cut flowers, fruit and vegetables) to lose competitiveness against other Latin American countries that maintained FTAs with the US. Bilateral ties have improved under Mr Moreno; the US and Ecuador were set to meet in April to discuss a potential trade agreement, but the meeting has been postponed on the back of the coronavirus outbreak. Even assuming that talks resume later in 2020, there is little indication that a new FTA is likely within the 2020-24 forecast period.
- There has been some progress in streamlining custom procedures in order to improve efficiency in recent years, although corruption and drug smuggling via overseas shipments remain a problem. A number of electronic procedures and automation processes have helped to speed up the delivery of goods. However, frequent changes to custom duties have acted as a major disincentive for legitimate businesses and will continue to fuel contraband trade in 2020-24.
- The Impuesto a la Salida de Divisas (ISD, a 5% tax on capital outflows) applies to all non-cash, hard-currency transactions of repatriated capital and transfers from banks to external accounts exceeding US$5,000. The authorities have indicated that they will phase the tax out once economic stability improves and the reserves position strengthens, but this is unlikely to happen before the second half of the forecast period.

Ecuador's score and ranking for taxation improve dramatically in the forecast period. In the historical period official tax policy stance was volatile and prone to abrupt changes in legislation to meet short-term financing needs. This fuelled uncertainty and was a major impediment to investment. However, under the auspices of the IMF, the current government has made some progress in recent months, passing a tax reform-albeit watered down-in December. The IMF will put pressure on the government to press on with other measures to strengthen the tax system, including boosting the powers of the tax administration to combat widespread evasion and abuse of tax avoidance schemes. Given that these measures will be less politically controversial than hikes in tax rates, there is a reasonable chance that the administration will be able to secure support for this. Assuming that the next government retains these measures, it is likely that, in time, the Servicio de Rentas Internas (Ecuador's tax authority) will begin to establish a better reputation in terms of efficiency.

- The recently approved tax reform raises much less revenue than initially targeted, but it will help to retain IMF backing and could lay the foundations for further amendments to the tax system during the 2020-24 forecast period. The government initially expressed the hope that a new tax reform would lift revenue by 1.5-2 percentage points of GDP, but as the bill was progressively watered down, targeted revenue levels were scaled back. In the end the legislation that passed in December is likely to increase tax revenue by just 0.5% of GDP in both 2020 and 2021. Most of the increase relates to two separate measures: an increase of 0.2% on the income tax rate of companies with revenue in excess of US$50m; and levying income tax on dividends distributed by resident companies to non-resident businesses or individuals. Changes to some consumer taxes, for example levying VAT on digital services such as Netflix or Uber that are charged to credit cards issued in Ecuador, will also raise revenue. The new reforms ease some filing rules and taxes for specific sectors such as agriculture.
- At 12%, the VAT rate is more than five percentage points below the average rate in South America and three percentage points below the average rate in Latin America and the Caribbean. Mr Moreno has so far resisted pressure from the IMF to raise the VAT rate, but renewed efforts to increase VAT during 2020-24 are possible. We view marked VAT hikes as unlikely, owing to the high risk of domestic backlash, but there may be other changes to personal income taxes and consumption taxes in order to lift the tax take, including reducing personal allowances and deductions.

Ecuador's score for financing in 2020-24 improves noticeably (from a low base), but with similarly ranked countries also making improvements, its rankings improve more moderately. State intervention in the banking sector was a feature of the business environment under Mr Correa but is unlikely to pose a significant risk during 2020-24, explaining the increase in Ecuador's score in this area. Mr Moreno's policy stance has engendered greater confidence among commercial banks as well as their customers, with deposit and credit growth picking up, albeit from a low base. However, many structural problems will continue to complicate corporate access to finance. The country's banking sector remains underdeveloped compared to the size of the economy; financial services are relatively rudimentary, with a small secondary market and two stock exchanges (in Quito, the capital, and Guayaquil) vying with each other for a limited pool of bond and equity issuances. In this context, financing is-and will remain-dominated by bank loans, with only large companies able to secure the lowest rates of about 7%. Smaller companies face rates upwards of 12%, with loan maturities often capped at three years. Long-term bank finance and capital market finance remain underdeveloped and difficult to secure.

- An expected sharp recession in 2020 (and a weak forecast recovery thereafter) poses risks to the financial sector during 2020-24 that could affect companies' ability to access credit. Financial soundness indicators remain reasonable for now, but are likely to deteriorate over the course of 2020. With profit ratios already relatively low, firms could find it more difficult (or costly) to borrow if banks become more cautious about lending. This risk would be elevated if banks experience a run on deposits (the vast majority of which are still held in instant-access accounts).
- Confidence in the banking system is tied to the management of reserve requirements at the Banco Central del Ecuador (the central bank), which is central to sustaining dollarisation but has been the target of regulatory changes. With the government's dollar liquidity needs likely to rise in the forecast period, there is a risk of more aggressive control on bank deposits, with potentially damaging effects on lending and market confidence. The government will continue to seek broad stability in the banking sector, reducing the risk of directed lending policies in 2020-24. However, regulatory changes made since 2014 mean that the possibility of these policies still exists, as the Junta Monetaria (the monetary board) technically retains important discretionary powers. Although it is not part of our central forecast (given the current government's more market-friendly stance), further changes to the regulatory environment cannot be discounted during 2020-24.

Despite marginal improvements in the underlying score in 2020-24, the labour market will remain one of the weakest areas of Ecuador's business environ-ment. An increase in spending on education and training programmes during the oil boom years failed to raise skills levels or productivity, with lower oil prices necessitating subsequent cutbacks. Skills shortages and mismatches remain a problem, compounded by a lack of effective training programmes in both the public and private sectors. Although recent moves to increase flexibility in labour market regulation are positive, the need for fiscal adjustment will cap public investment in education, meaning that long-running and structural problems (such as skills shortages) are unlikely to be tackled. Access to social security has improved for some sectors of the population, but the labour market remains highly informal, which will be difficult to tackle. In comparative terms, labour costs will edge down slightly in 2020-24 but will remain high, particularly relative to productivity.

- The government had been seeking to table a reform bill to increase labour market flexibility and promote job creation, but plans were pushed back as negotiations between the authorities and unions and pressure groups dragged on. However, the government has incorporated most of the planned changes into a broader "humanitarian support" law that was passed by emergency decree in early May in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The changes make it easier to renegotiate labour contracts between employers and employees. Both sides can now agree to salary reductions to avoid lay-offs and can negotiate changes in the number of working hours (and how these are spread, allowing employees more flexibility), with social security obligations and benefits adjusted accordingly. The initial limit for this flexibility in contracts is two years, but contracts can be renewed annually for two more years. There is likely to be domestic resistance, given the public perception that the changes are designed to benefit companies rather than protect jobs, and there is a risk that the law may be reversed (although this does not form part of our baseline forecast). Regardless, the measures are unlikely to stimulate job creation-or even prevent job losses-given the extremely weak underlying investment climate.
- The strength of the US dollar will compound competitiveness problems with other countries in the region in the short term (Ecuador's minimum wage is among the highest in Latin America in dollar terms, although its productivity lags that of most of its neighbours). Although we expect some depreciation of the US dollar during 2021-24, this will be mild and insufficient to boost competitiveness significantly.
- Efforts to improve education will flounder, at least in 2020-21, reflecting the government's difficult fiscal position, which will preclude an increase in public spending. Pledges to construct 40 new universities will not materialise given the current economic climate. As part of the borrowing agreement with the IMF, the government has committed to drawing up an action plan that focuses on ways of improving the efficiency and quality of primary education (although the target date for this plan has been repeatedly pushed back, most recently to the end of June). Aside from uncertainty regarding the source of funding for such investment, long-standing educational challenges will not be addressed. Although net secondary school enrolment has risen in recent years, student results continue to trail those of other countries in the region. Improving results will require a sustained and long-term commitment from the government; even assuming improved quality of education policies, student results would be unlikely to improve until towards the end of (or beyond) our forecast period.

Infrastructure was one of Ecuador's stronger areas in the business environment rankings in the historical period, owing to major capital spending by the Correa administration. Although some further improvements in 2020-24 are likely, these will be moderate (reflecting fiscal constraints), resulting in only a marginal improvement in Ecuador's global ranking in this area. A large public investment programme put in place by Mr Correa means that multiple projects are likely to reach completion during the forecast period, given that financing has already been agreed and in many cases, the projects are under way (some, however, have been cancelled owing to project mismanagement, and others have been subject to large cost overruns). These changes mean that after decades of underinvestment-and frequent electricity shortages-the quality of transport, energy and road infrastructure is now comparable to the Latin American median, and telecoms development (measured in mobile and internet penetration) is above the regional average. However, given the need for fiscal consolidation, government efforts to modernise infrastructure will be reined in sharply. The authorities will seek to attract private investment for infrastructure projects, but Ecuador lacks the solid track record of fostering successful PPPs that have helped to upgrade infrastructure in other countries in the region. Weak investor sentiment amid the coronavirus pandemic will also deter private-sector interest, at least during the first half of the forecast period.

- A major focus of the government's infrastructure programme has been the development of new hydroelectric power plants to avoid importing costly energy for gas-fired and thermoelectric plants. In the medium term, there is potential not only to close the supply-demand gap but also, potentially, to allow the country to export energy. On the downside, there are some concerns that projects will fail to reach expected generation levels owing to problems during construction or insufficient government investment in transmission and distribution facilities, which could lead to supply bottlenecks.
- Recent investment has led to road infrastructure improvements and the creation of new road networks. This is helping to boost domestic and intraregional trade, but has also created challenges including congestion, as advances in traffic management have been more limited. Moreover, seasonal heavy rains that are costly and difficult to fully mitigate continue to cause seasonal disruption in some areas. The difficult topography adds an additional obstacle, and there are concerns about misuse of funds. There has been much slower progress on developing mass transport systems to relieve urban congestion, including a much-delayed underground rail system in Quito, which was still not operational as at May 2020, and a tram project in Cuenca (Ecuador's third-largest city), which has been delayed but is now expected to start operations in June.

Although Ecuador's score for technological readiness improves in 2020-24, its global and regional rankings are set to slip as other similarly ranked countries make more substantial progress during the forecast period. Its global ranking of 75th makes this area one of the weakest of the business environment, reflecting low smartphone penetration and a lack of spending on research and innovation, which undermine the overall score. However, Ecuador scores relatively well in areas such as preparedness for e-commerce and cyber-security.
The government has set targets to grow the telecoms and information technology sectors. Internet access through mobile phones will drive wider mobile-phone usage during the outlook period as handsets and data tariffs become more affordable and mobile phones are used increasingly in place of personal computers (PCs). We expect data services to be the fastest-growing segment of the mobile market. However, coverage remains inadequate and costs are high, limiting access. Efforts to loosen foreign-owned firms' grip on the mobile market may boost competition, but the investment climate and a complicated regulatory environment for foreign companies will remain impediments. Internet penetration, particularly broadband, has been limited, but we expect it to grow over the forecast period as technology becomes more widely available and connectivity improves. In line with this, the number of overall internet subscriptions will continue to grow.

- The expansion of fourth-generation (4G) technology has so far been limited to a few hub areas. The Correa government imposed high costs on new contracts for mobile-telephony firms in 2008, which slowed roll-out as companies worked to recover costs. Smartphone adoption was relatively late, reflecting low income levels and high tariffs on imported handsets (classified as luxury goods under Mr Correa). In July 2019 the Moreno government launched its Ecuador Digital programme, which aims to increase penetration indicators (particularly in rural areas), improve internet speeds, expand 4G broadband and accelerate the allocation of new telecoms bandwidth, with a view to beginning fifth-generation (5G) testing. The government is also seeking to develop the use of digital identification, implement cyber-security measures and boost e-commerce.
- Rising internet penetration and smartphone usage will help to foster growth in online retail, albeit from a low base. According to the Ecuadorean Chamber of Electronic Commerce (CECE), e-commerce generated US$1.2bn in sales in 2019, up from US$1bn in 2018. In 2020 it anticipates sales of US$1.5bn as rising numbers of Ecuadoreans become regular e-commerce customers, although the coronavirus pandemic is likely to mean that e-commerce sales rise even more strongly.

Economic forecast: Policy trends The coronavirus outbreak will push Ecuador closer to a disorderly default and a balance-of-payments crisis. Avoiding this will require, more than ever, support from the IMF (and other actors), but meeting the conditions required to access these funds will be extremely complicated politically, heightening risks in the coming months. Political pressure to loosen fiscal policy and suspend external debt payments is mounting and will persist, but Mr Moreno will try to maintain fiscal discipline and work to improve the country's credibility. Having made an agreement with private creditors in April to defer interest payments of US$811m due between late March and August 15th, the government will seek an amicable restructuring of its debt with its creditors, rather than trigger a disorderly default.
Mr Moreno's stance will catalyse much-needed multilateral financial assistance. Although the targets of the government's three-year, US$4.2bn extended fund facility (EFF) with the IMF (accompanied by US$6bn in additional multilateral financing, intended to be disbursed between March 2019 and December 2021) are all but feasible, the government was able to access US$643m through the IMF's rapid financing instrument (RFI) in early May. The RFI comes with little conditionality and was disbursed after the government published unflattering data corrections and submitted public financial management reforms to the legislature. In turn, this has facilitated further financing from the World Bank (US$500m) and the Latin American Development Bank (US$300m).
Bearing in mind that the government is working to establish a successor arrangement with the Fund, we expect its commitment to fiscal discipline to be resolute. Negotiations to secure a new agreement will be buoyed not only by fiscal pragmatism amid the coronavirus crisis, but also by the passage of emergency economic legislation in May that goes beyond the immediate necessities of the pandemic; approved reforms to public financial management will reduce discretionary budget changes considerably and help to improve Ecuador's medium-term fiscal framework. The reforms, including a savings fund, will aid talks with the Fund and bondholders alike.
Although the objectives of the government's IMF-backed economic programme have been overshadowed by the policy response to the economic and health crises, the government's policy agenda has not been derailed entirely. The government successfully passed legislation in mid-May that temporarily loosened labour market regulations and in late May announced that fuel imports would be fully liberalised, with prices for consumers guided by global market prices. Unlike the drastic elimination of fuel subsidies in October (which was quickly reversed after protests), a system of price bands with 5% ceilings is to be introduced (on July 1st) to avoid swift increases in fuel prices.
Assuming that a centre-right or centre-left government takes office in May 2021 and provides for policy continuity, we expect that the EFF's four primary objectives will continue to be prioritised in the medium to long term. These are improving competitiveness, tackling fiscal imbalances, protecting the poor and fighting corruption. Moreover, under our political assumptions-and in the light of the unfolding crises-we view IMF assistance beyond 2021 as highly probable. This suggests a piecemeal advancement of business-friendly policies and complementary reforms in 2021-24. Nonetheless, limited progress will be made in diversifying the economy away from oil (the country left OPEC in January to free itself from quotas).
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy Fiscal indicators
(% of GDP)
  2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024
Government revenue 33.4 27.2 29.7 30.9 31.4 31.6
Government expenditure 36.2 33.3 33.7 33.2 33.2 32.9
Budget balance -2.8 -6.1 -4.1 -2.3 -1.8 -1.3
The government will have some (albeit limited) success in cushioning the blow to the fiscal accounts from the drastic halt to domestic economic activity and lower oil revenue than previously anticipated in the budget. Nevertheless, we expect a widening of the fiscal deficit. Even assuming that spending cuts materialise and that new, extraordinary multilateral and bilateral assistance is forthcoming, this will not be enough to plug the fiscal hole produced by the collapse in oil prices.
On the expenditure side, the government plans to accelerate the downsizing of the state and to reduce spending by a total of US$4bn (about 4% of GDP and 15% of the original 2020 budget) this year. The government intends to reduce the wage bill by US$980m, spending on goods and services by US$400m and capital expenditure by US$1.3bn. It also plans to save a total of US$1.3bn in debt service costs from (previously announced) bond renegotiations. On the revenue side, the government is facing a substantial drop in income; we forecast that falling oil and tax revenue will lead to US$8bn less in revenue for the non-financial public sector (NFPS) compared to last year. The government's targeted fiscal savings are likely to be overly optimistic, however, considering its struggle to dial back spending in recent months and the National Assembly's opposition to increasing taxes amid an economic crisis.
On balance, we forecast that the NFPS deficit will widen to 6.1% of GDP in 2020, assuming that the cut to public spending is much less than the drop in revenue. Public debt as a percentage of GDP will rise from an estimated 46.9% in 2019 to 57.2% in 2020. The fiscal targets set in the government's EFF are not feasible; an improvement of 4 percentage points in the non-oil primary balance/GDP ratio (including subsidies) from 2019 to 2021 and a reduction in the public debt/GDP ratio to 40% by 2024 will not be achieved.
The successor IMF agreement will shed light on how fiscal targets and fiscal policymaking adapt to the looming economic recession. Irrespective of the changes, programme implementation risks will be glaringly high, as social and political challenges to reforms exceed their pre-crisis levels. Without details of a new deal, and assuming policy continuity, we expect that the NFPS deficit will narrow gradually in 2021-24, to 1.3% of GDP by 2024, and that the public debt/GDP ratio will stabilise at about 61%.
We are cautiously optimistic that that the government will avoid a disorderly default, owing to bilateral and multilateral financing-the government estimates that it will receive about US$2bn from multilateral creditors and China-and prudent debt-management operations. Following a final US$325m payment on the capital of a 10.5%, five-year bond in mid-March, the government successfully launched a consent solicitation in mid-April to defer US$811m in interest payments due between late March and mid-August. Although it is not yet our baseline forecast, there is a substantial risk that Ecuador will be forced into a debt restructuring this year, or will fall into disorderly default ahead of larger payments in the second half of 2020.

As a dollarised economy, Ecuador lacks independent monetary policy and will not be able to foment a monetary policy response to the economic crisis. Monetary conditions will continue to be determined largely by external factors, but real local rates will remain elevated, owing to Ecuador's high risk premium. Monetary growth will hinge on foreign-exchange inflows, as well as the confidence of domestic lenders, both of which will be markedly undermined by the rapid deterioration of the economy. The threat of de-dollarisation will sustain the risk of capital flight, which raises the risk of preventative measures being implemented in the short term to protect domestic liquidity levels.

Economic forecast: Economic growth The impact of the coronavirus: global and regional assumptions The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecasts are built on a series of epidemiological assumptions on the novel coronavirus (Covid-19). Without rapid access to a vaccine, we expect that the disease will eventually infect up to 30% of the world's population. We assume that about 15% of symptomatic cases will be severe and that up to 1% of symptomatic cases will prove fatal. Death ratios will depend on a country's ability to detect, track and contain the virus, and the capacity of the national health system. Governments are lifting restrictions on freedom of movement gradually in countries where the number of cases is falling and where there is sufficient spare capacity in the healthcare system. Some countries may be forced to re-impose measures if cases spike again. Based on previous viral outbreaks and the progress made on other coronavirus vaccines (such as that for severe acute respiratory syndrome-SARS), we expect a vaccine to be available by end-2021.
In economic terms, we forecast that global output will contract by 4.2% year on year in 2020 and that global trade will decline by 24.8%. Global GDP will not recover to pre-coronavirus levels before at least 2022; 2020 and 2021 will be lost years for growth. Real GDP will contract in all regions of the world, but the drop in output will be especially severe in OECD countries. All G7 countries and almost all G20 countries will experience a full-year recession in 2020. We expect China's real GDP growth to slow sharply to 1% this year, and forecast a full-year recession in the US, with a contraction of 4%. We assume that oil prices will decline by more than 40% this year, to average US$38/barrel. Most countries have responded with huge fiscal expansion to support businesses and households, raising the risk of sovereign debt crises in the medium term. Central banks have cut interest rates and, more importantly, have stepped up as buyers of last resort for government and corporate debt.
The infection curve in Latin America is about four to six weeks behind that of European countries and about two to three weeks behind that of the US. Most countries in the region, with a few notable exceptions, responded swiftly to the public health threat and implemented strict containment measures. However, by and large, governments were unable to use the time bought by the lockdowns to adequately test, trace and isolate those infected. As a result, Latin America is emerging as a new epicentre for the virus; although the region makes up just over 8% of the world's population, it accounts for close to 14% of confirmed coronavirus cases globally. Despite this, even as the coronavirus caseload continues to grow, policymakers have been left with little option but to evaluate possible exit strategies. The sudden stop to activity has precipitated a dramatic economic collapse, and most governments lack the fiscal space and the institutional capacity to provide support to consumers and business during a more protracted lockdown. Although exit strategies will vary from country to country, most governments are phasing out restrictions in a gradual manner to ensure that the numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths remain under control, health services can cope and public confidence in the handling of the crisis remains strong. Nonetheless, there is a high risk that even a gradual and phased easing will expose countries to a second wave of infections (as has happened in Singapore and South Korea).
The coronavirus pandemic will have a severe economic impact. We forecast a Latin American recession in 2020, with an aggregate contraction of over 7% and output in all of the major economies contracting by 4-10%. Some Caribbean countries, which depend on tourism, will be hit even harder. Quarantine measures will result in a sharp supply-side shock, hitting working hours and productivity, and manufacturers will suffer from a disruption to global supply. Supply-side disruptions will be short-lived, but demand effects will be long-lasting. A decline in confidence is likely to persist after quarantine measures are lifted. For fear of contagion, people may continue to avoid public spaces, and tourism may not resume immediately. Households will limit their consumption in response to a loss of income, and businesses will delay investment.
The longer-lasting political and geopolitical impact of the crisis will be significant. The pandemic has resulted in an extraordinary expansion of executive powers, with limited parliamentary oversight. Elections have been cancelled, or delayed, in some countries. When the pandemic has passed, governments will face intense scrutiny on their response. A failure to address the humanitarian crisis triggered by the coronavirus could further erode trust in national institutions. A severe global economic crisis, followed by renewed fiscal austerity and large-scale unemployment, will fuel a new wave of popular protests. The crisis may encourage support for the nation state and a backlash against globalisation and open borders. The competition for global leadership between China and the US will intensify as a result of the crisis, and a realignment of geopolitical spheres of influence may ensue in Europe, Africa and other regions. This will provide a challenging environment for Latin America over the medium term as the region tries to grapple with the debt overhang from the extra spending measures and the hit to revenue, as well as lower potential growth rates, owing to the damage to productive sector value chains, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

We expect real GDP to contract by 9% in 2020. Net exports are still likely to contribute positively to growth despite a large drop in export volumes; we expect these to decrease by 15% as external demand falls markedly. However, this drop will be overshadowed by a sizeable 25% decline in import volumes, which will reflect a significant deterioration in domestic demand.
Low oil receipts will lead to a retrenchment in government consumption, indirectly feeding through to private consumption, which will be constrained by a worsening labour market. Economic and political uncertainties will weigh on private investment, which will decline for a second consecutive year. Assuming that the coronavirus outbreak is controlled by end-2020-prompting a recovery in external and domestic demand-we expect real GDP growth to rebound in 2021, but it will remain below 2019 levels.
Political uncertainties will be elevated by the February 2021 general election; this will preclude a more robust pick-up in domestic demand. We expect growth to be tepid in 2022, considering the 2021 rebound, but it should slowly improve thereafter as policy uncertainties wane, oil prices rise and moderate improvements to the business environment materialise.
Economic forecast: Sectoral trends Notwithstanding the oil price shock and pipeline damage in early 2020, the oil sector will remain of critical importance to the Ecuadorean economy. Oil export earnings comprise about 40% of total export revenue and a third of government revenue. Although oil production will fall below ambitious government targets owing to delays and pressure from environmental and social groups, production will creep up in the 2020-24 forecast period. Increasing public-sector production (accounting for about 80% of national production) will be driven by domestic fiscal needs that precipitated the government's departure from OPEC (to free the country from quotas) at the start of 2020. Private-sector production will expand, aided by a return to a production-sharing contract model, but more robust growth in the private oil industry will be slow, as the government continues to struggle to attract major exploration activities (partially owing to indigenous anti-oil activism).
Growth in the oil sector will primarily emanate from increased production at the 1.6bn-barrel, heavy crude Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini oil field. However, problems in receiving environmental permits have impeded a faster expansion of production. This has also hampered investment in some privately operated fields, which would help to lift production if allowed to proceed. The government has set January 2021 as a target date for the complete merger of the two state-owned oil companies, Petroecuador and Petroamazonas, which is likely to support future production. Petroecuador is currently the downstream company, whereas Petroamazonas is responsible for upstream production. Petroecuador assets could potentially be under consideration in the medium term for a concessionary model, whereby a private firm would administer operations and pass on a portion of the net profits to the state.
Mining sector enters growth phase, albeit with stumbling blocks The mining sector will rise in prominence over the medium term. The sector is another major sector of importance for state finances and is poised to expand, as two major, foreign investor-driven mining projects came online in late 2019: Fruta del Norte (a gold mine) and Mirador (primarily a copper mine). At the beginning of the year the government projected that Fruta del Norte would generate nearly US$500m in export earnings in 2020 (up from US$46m in 2019) and Mirador about US$450m (an 800% year-on-year increase). Earnings will be weaker than the government expected owing to a standstill in mining activity at the height of the pandemic and weaker demand from energy-hungry industries such as construction and manufacturing. Over the medium term, however, the sector will continue to expand (buoyed by the 2019 removal of a 70% "windfall tax" on mining profits) as a series of further projects attract major mining companies that compete for stakes. This contrasts with the oil industry, where top-level interest is limited.
Lingering legal uncertainties and local resistance will, however, clip Ecuador's aspirations to be a mining major. Friction between local communities and mining firms in particular will slow investment. Many mineral deposits are located in environmentally sensitive areas, close to communities that have lodged complaints with local courts alleging that mining firms have failed to undergo consultation processes. A lack of cohesion among anti-mining activists and differences in opinion within Ecuador make the imminent cancellation of major mining projects currently under construction and under advanced exploration unlikely. Our view is that the mining sector will continue to face difficulties that will prevent a more dramatic rise in extractive production.

Real wages 1.8 1.5 1.7 1.4 1.4 1.5
Tumbling commodity prices, weak demand and a strengthening US dollar will produce deflation this year. Consumer prices were flat in 2019, and we expect them to fall by an average of 0.3% this year. We expect inflation to pick up slightly, to an annual average of 0.9% in 2021-24, as import costs rise owing to renewed dollar weakness and an increase in commodity prices. Dollarisation will help to contain inflation, but the economy will remain vulnerable to increases in food and energy prices.

Risks to dollarisation have risen and remain elevated in the short term. The economic crisis presents major problems of financing and liquidity, as oil prices have crashed and access to global financing remains limited. These problems are likely to be compounded by a short-term strengthening of the US dollar (hurting competitiveness) and a dip in reserves.
Nevertheless, we currently assume that dollarisation will be retained in 2020-24, as the government's commitment to its IMF agreement and to fiscal discipline allows for greater multilateral financing. The real effective exchange rate will remain stronger than its long-term, pre-dollarisation average but in real, trade-weighted terms, there will be some depreciation as the US dollar begins to weaken in 2021-24.

The current-account deficit will widen in 2020 as the macroeconomic back-drop deteriorates. Diminishing oil revenue will weigh significantly on the trade balance in the short term as oil prices languish and external demand withers. Non-oil export earnings will be hit hard, with shrimp and mining exports in particular suffering from domestic restrictions on business operations to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and a retraction of demand in major export markets, including China and the US. Deterioration of the trade balance will be softened by collapsing domestic demand, which will produce import compression. However, remittances are also likely to suffer, as economic activity has ground to a halt outside Ecuador, dragging down the current-account deficit. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows will suffer in 2020-21 and remain below 1% of GDP. They will pick up thereafter and average 1% of GDP in 2022-24.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Ecuador Stocks and flows Ecuador has historically attracted relatively little foreign direct investment (FDI). Annual inflows of FDI averaged US$700m in 1994-2008, driven mainly by the oil sector (which accounted for 80% of total FDI). After barely breaching US$1bn in 2008 (1.8% of GDP), FDI inflows fell to only US$165m in 2010. They recovered somewhat to average US$774m (0.8% of GDP) in 2011-17, the final seven years of leadership by the former president, Rafael Correa (2007-17), whose policies led to a deterioration in investor confidence. FDI inflows jumped in 2018 and reached US$1.5bn, up by 127% year on year, reflecting the more conciliatory approach to the private sector of the current president, Lenín Moreno. FDI inflows moderated in 2019, reaching US$966m (0.9% of GDP). The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates the total stock of inward FDI at US$19.7bn at end-2019. This is one of the smallest stocks among the major Latin American economies, equating to 18.3% of GDP. Ecuador's stock is also small on a per-head basis, estimated at US$1,138 in 2019.
Origin and distribution The US, historically the main source of FDI inflows into Ecuador, went through a period of disinvestment in the country between 2008 and 2010, largely owing to uncertainty surrounding oil contract renegotiations and the global financial crisis. Investment from the US has since moderated, totalling US$76m in 2019 and averaging 7% of total inflows in 2016-19. FDI from China rose after Ecuador established closer trade and diplomatic ties with that country in 2011, but inflows have tapered off recently. In 2019 Chinese FDI accounted for 3% of total inflows, down from 15% in 2016. Foreign investment is primarily directed towards oil, mining and infrastructure projects, as evidenced by the origin of inflows; in 2019 25% of foreign investment originated from Canada (the Fruta del Norte gold mine commissioned last year is owned by a Canadian firm). The manufacturing, agri- and aqua-culture, and retail sectors all attract foreign investment, but extractive industries account for the lion's share of foreign investment, totalling about 50% of FDI inflows in 2018-19.
Determinants Although Ecuador has a wealth of natural resources, policy uncertainty and an unreliable business environment deter investment. Mr Moreno's administration has taken a more active role than its predecessor in attracting private foreign investment; his government has focused on fomenting investment in the extractive sectors, reintroducing production-sharing contracts and eliminating the 70% "windfall tax" on profits in mining. However, stronger interest from foreign investors has not materialised, as the uncertain regulatory and legal environment persists and acts as a conspicuous deterrent. Global prices, also a major determinant, have been soft, discouraging interest. Moreover, Ecuador's weak institutions, small domestic market, relatively high cost of labour and low income levels still deter FDI in most non-extractive sectors.
Impact The impact of inward FDI on productivity and export competitiveness has been limited because most investment has been directed towards capital-intensive natural resource sectors, which have weak links to the rest of the economy. However, FDI has helped to boost export earnings in the energy sector.
Potential The country's strong endowments of natural resources will be a major source of attraction for foreign investors. There are notable FDI opportunities in Ecuador's petroleum, mining, manufacturing and services sectors. Although policy uncertainty, infrastructure deficiencies and low levels of labour productivity persist, we expect incremental improvements to the business environment under the auspices of the IMF, improving the country's competitiveness. A more pragmatic approach to attracting private foreign capital and a shift away from the unorthodox macroeconomic policies of Mr Correa's government will also provide upside to the country's medium-term attractiveness. Still, ingrained opposition from powerful domestic interest groups will continue to complicate efforts to open up investment opportunities in the oil sector. Sluggishness in consumption and tepid recovery after the pandemic in 2020 will also deter investment.

Population growth is slowing In 2019 the population reached an estimated 17.3m, and is expected to rise by 1.2m people by 2024. With a falling birth rate and continued-albeit lower-emigration, the rate of population growth is slowing. However, at an annual average of 1.3% per year in the 2020-24 forecast period, growth will be high compared with developed-country standards and on a par with neighbours in the Andean region. The rate of urbanisation is relatively high; about 64% of the population lives in urban centres, compared with 55% in 1990. This percentage is expected to rise to about 65% by the end of the forecast period. Almost half of city dwellers reside either in the capital, Quito, or in the largest city and main business centre, Guayaquil. Rapid urbanisation over the past 50 years has increased the level of informality, as the creation of full-time jobs has risen at a much slower pace. The unemployment rate was 3.9% at end-2019, which is low by historical standards (and has remained stable year on year), although underemployment remains high, affecting more than half of the workforce. The labour force is expected to continue to expand more rapidly than the overall population during the forecast period, with about 800,000 new labour market entrants in 2020-24. In view of the coronavirus pandemic, the administration of the president, Lenín Moreno, has temporarily increased the flexibility of the labour market; this is positive, but the formal economy will continue to struggle to absorb new entrants, particularly as diversification away from the energy-dominant labour market will be slow (and will focus primarily on mining and agriculture). Informal employment, estimated by the government at 46.7% of the labour force as at December 2019, is therefore likely to stay high.
Although inflows of illegal migrants from Colombia have fallen in recent years, inflows from Venezuela will put strain on the domestic labour market. Ecuador has received more than 400,000 migrants from Venezuela, and the government will struggle to integrate them into the formal market, especially in the wake of the coronavirus-induced recession. The economic fallout from the pandemic and the subsequent slow recovery may well lead to a reversal of Venezuelan migration, with Venezuelans attracted to stronger neighbouring economies.
In 2020-24 The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Ecuador's crude birth rate to fall to an annual average of 19.1 per 1,000 population (down from 20.6 in the 2015-19 historical period). The crude death rate will remain steady, at an annual average of 5.2 per 1,000 population in 2020-24. The old-age dependency ratio, which will rise slightly, reaching 0.13 by 2024, will remain low by developed-country standards. However, given constraints on public spending, an ageing population will place growing pressure on an already heavily indebted social security system, especially as the coronavirus pandemic has laid bare the many deficiencies in the healthcare system. Although the government plans to reduce its divestments from the state-run social security institute, we expect the state-run social security system to encounter difficulties in ending its debt woes.
Slow progress in improving education and healthcare standards The precarious state of the country's public finances will hinder improvements in education and healthcare standards. Strong oil revenue in the 2000s commodity boom allowed for improvements in poverty levels and social indicators following decades of underinvestment in these areas-public expenditure on health services and education doubled as a percentage of GDP under the previous administration. However, low standards and outcomes persist. Some gains receded because of the 2015-16 recession, which led to a spike in underemployment. Regular labour conflicts with public healthcare and education workers, often resulting in industrial action, further hampered improvements in the quality of services. The 2008 constitution promised free universal healthcare and education but-considering its fiscal difficulties in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic-the government will struggle to achieve these goals during the forecast period. Improvements in education and healthcare standards will be only gradual, with progress crippled by narrow opportunities to raise spending in these areas.

Ecuador is one of the smallest markets included in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings, accounting for about 0.1% of global GDP and a similar share of global exports. Its oil and mineral reserves will continue to attract interest from foreign investors, although questions about policy reliability and doubts regarding the business environment, combined with tepid global commodity prices, will deter many private investors, with foreign state-owned companies securing a stronger position.
Market will expand modestly after coronavirus recession Boosted by a rising population but hindered by anaemic economic growth, Ecuador's market size will expand modestly in the 2020-24 forecast period. Although it has risen in recent years, GDP per head, estimated at US$6,206 in 2019, will fall sharply in 2020 and is forecast to only reach US$6,080 in 2024. This tepid growth in GDP per head will restrict business opportunities. Moreover, Ecuador's per-head income figures will continue to disguise wide inequalities. Despite a rise in consumption after the crisis in 2020, we expect reductions in income inequality to be marginal at best in 2020-24, as rates of unemployment-and in particular underemployment-will decrease only moderately in the wake of the crisis. Cutbacks in the rate of minimum-wage increases will also weigh on consumption.
The government of the former president, Rafael Correa (2007-17), invested the proceeds of the oil price boom in upgrading the country's underdeveloped infrastructure. Substantial improvements were made, particularly to the road system, but significant gaps remain. The current administration, led by Lenín Moreno, has been more accommodative to private-sector investors, and we expect that a centrist government taking office in May 2021 will work to improve the legal framework to provide a moderate boost for investment (domestic and foreign), notably in the export-oriented energy and mining sectors, and related services. However, despite a strong natural resource endowment, growth in exports will remain below potential, and Ecuador's share of world exports will stagnate at about 0.1%.
As a result of dollarisation and successive years of guaranteeing a "living wage" (essentially a minimum wage), Ecuador is no longer a cheap-labour investment location. In US dollar terms, the country's minimum wage is one of the highest in Latin America. Also weighing on the country's competitiveness are low skills levels. However, dollarisation facilitates greater overall macroeconomic stability for businesses to assess investment opportunities, particularly by reducing inflation and exchange-rate risks. Investment in most areas outside the oil sector will be slow to arrive, as improvements to the business environment will be incremental, given political hurdles amid a highly fragmented political landscape. At the same time, advancements in the transparency and efficiency of the judicial system will be unhurried and slow to take effect.

Business opportunities limited by low level of development As the coronavirus pandemic produces a marked decline in disposable incomes, a shift in consumer attitudes towards cheaper brands and lower-cost, high-volume outlets is likely in the immediate term. Over the medium to long term, however, we expect a gradual rise in the proportion of income spent on food, beverages and tobacco, housing and household fuels, and transport and communications. This assumes that purchasing power picks up from a trough in 2020 amid improved labour market conditions. Ecuador's market will, however, remain comparatively small. We currently expect a centrist govern-ment to be elected in 2021, auguring the advancement of business-friendly policies. Nevertheless, progress will be incremental, as robust support will be absent in what is likely to be a fragmented legislature. Development will be slow, but dollarisation will provide price and exchange-rate stability.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Ample scope for catch-up but challenges persist Ecuador's wealth of natural resources, a young and expanding middle class and a push to improve educational standards offer scope to catch up with more developed countries over the next four decades. However, a series of challenges need to be addressed over the short and medium term to build on these positive conditions. Although the investment rate has improved considerably, it remains overly reliant on public-sector spending, which in turn is vulnerable to changes in commodity prices. Private investment is scant and overall savings are low, two factors that are only likely to improve moderately in the coming years, holding down productivity growth. Despite a more stable policy framework, Ecuador's institutions are likely to remain weak, and progress in tackling a large informal sector will be limited. Nevertheless, higher spending on health and education should help to improve labour productivity growth in 2031-50. In this context-and barring a sharp and prolonged deterioration in the country's terms of trade or a return to severe political instability-The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the economy to expand more robustly in 2031-50 (2.2%), after posting tepid GDP growth in the wake of the coronavirus crisis (averaging 0.7% in 2020-30).
Initial conditions: Rapid urbanisation in the past 30 years and faster integration into the world economy have produced few long-term benefits for the population. Political instability, weak institutions and high levels of poverty and inequality-combined with an economy overly dependent on oil-have yielded a rent-seeking and unproductive economy, plagued by low education levels and productivity, and high labour informality. The government of Rafael Correa (2007-17) made efforts to address low social indicators and improve infrastructure, but failed to boost private investment and savings. The Correa government also harmed the legal framework for investment by constantly changing regulations and putting up hurdles to capital. Although dollarisation has brought macroeconomic stability since 2000, it has also made Ecuador less competitive and has accentuated the risks of inadequate fiscal management.
Demographic trends: Population growth is set to fall gradually over the long term, from an average of 1.2% in 2020-30, to 0.8% in 2031-50. The main cause will be lower fertility rates, in addition to some net migration. On the upside, we project that the growth of the working-age population will continue to outstrip overall population growth until 2040, providing a major demographic boom and keeping the dependency ratio low. The main challenge facing the country will be to create enough formal jobs for entrants to the labour market, so as to reduce informality. There has been some progress in expanding education across all levels to improve labour quality, but the lack of dynamism in the private sector means that there is a substantial risk of labour informality remaining high in the long term. An additional challenge is to tackle the pension needs of an ageing population, which could increase strains on the country's vulnerable social security system.
External conditions: As a small, open economy, Ecuador has benefited from rising global trade. At the same time, it remains vulnerable to changes in commodity prices. This in turn causes significant external and fiscal volatility, as evidenced by the coronavirus crisis. The potential for stronger integration with industrialised nations or blocs like the US and EU (traditionally Ecuador's main trade partners) will remain constrained by long geographical distances and the lack of a consistent trade policy. Rising trade integration with neighbouring countries could boost growth, but progress will be slow, owing to sporadic trade spats, lack of supply chain strategies and infrastructure constraints. Export diversification towards the Middle East, Russia and Asia has seen some success, but Ecuador's small and distant market will drag its competitiveness profile, particularly in relation to other emerging markets in Asia. With the economy likely to remain heavily dependent on hydrocarbons and some mineral and agricultural products, the external sector and GDP growth will be highly dependent on the direction of terms of trade.
Future governments will struggle with a weak institutional framework Institutions and policy trends: Ecuador's institutions have long suffered from periods of instability, and despite a growing sense of macroeconomic and political stability in the past couple of years, they remain fundamentally weak. Inconsistent policymaking remains a major problem, both in conceiving and implementing new legislation. Successive administrations have changed policy directions. The current government, under Lenín Moreno, does not enjoy the wide support of workers in all state institutions or a clear majority of the population, tailwinds that future governments will also find elusive. Although power is concentrated in the hands of the executive, a highly fragmented political and social landscape will complicate governability. In the short term, this will be tangible as the current (and next) government endeavour to restore health to the public finances after a period of fiscal profligacy under the previous administration of Rafael Correa. Regardless of their ideological inclination, future governments will continue to struggle with a weak legal framework, corruption and distorted policy priorities (such as oil subsidies that have proven difficult to eliminate) that either favour special interest groups or act as a major drag on the public finances.
Dollarisation will be protected by its persistent popularity Dollarisation: The policy of dollarisation will be retained, as it garners wide support for delivering price and exchange-rate stability. Moreover, the costs of abandonment-in particular the fear of stoking social unrest-are very high. However, an abandonment of the system cannot be ruled out, especially as the coronavirus pandemic pushes Ecuador closer to a disorderly default and a balance-of-payments crisis. Notwithstanding risks, we expect commitment to an IMF-backed economic programme to strengthen the foundations of dollarisation. The government will endeavour to build up international reserves throughout the duration of its agreement with the Fund (ending in 2021). This is likely to occur alongside pragmatic adjustments to monetary policymaking that reinforce a dollarised regime and the central bank's independence. Recent legislation to bolster the country's medium-term fiscal framework and continued IMF support also augur a more sustainable fiscal trajectory that is congruent with a fully dollarised economy. We are cautiously optimistic that, although reform progress will be slow, the long-term sustainability of dollarisation will be reinforced and Ecuador's fiscal stance will be more stable.
Long-term performance: Unattractive investment conditions and the lack of a competitive, skilled labour force will make Ecuador a relatively unappealing destination for foreign investment in labour-intensive or manufacturing activities. However, sustained improvements in education levels, topped with productive investment in non-oil sectors and technology transfer, could make Ecuador more competitive and boost long-term growth. For this to occur, there the country would need to strengthen its institutional framework and improve its business environment. Although Mr Moreno's administration (and the next government) is likely to pursue policies that strengthen private-led growth, our forecast suggests that the advancement of structural reforms will be slow and insufficient for Ecuador to catch up, income-wise, with OECD countries in the long term.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Prone to earthquakes, the country will continue to suffer from natural disaster risk, but its adaptation and readiness will improve following a particularly devastating earthquake in 2016. Climate change preparedness, however, is more lacking. Ecuador's geographical location and diversity renders it particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Owing to the near constant temperature year-round, a rising temperature has threatened the development of glaciers, which have not been able to replenish lost density during colder seasons. Indeed, Ecuador has experienced a significant reduction in the size of its glaciers in the two main mountain ranges-the Cordillera Oriental and the Cordillera Occidental-which in aggregate have seen a reduction of about a third over the past 50 years. By 2050 this trajectory will jeopardise the water sources for the country's major urban centres, such as the capital, Quito. Rising temperatures will also negatively affect agricultural production, as warmer winters cause crops to sprout prematurely and greater volatility in precipitation rates will also disrupt production.
Sustainability concerns will take centre stage in the medium to long term. Despite failing to reach the ambitious goal of generating 90% of electricity from renewable sources by 2017 (renewable energy currently accounts for about 65% of electricity generation, with hydroelectric power accounting for nearly all of this), hydroelectric and geothermal power primarily, and wind and solar power secondarily, will play an increasingly important role in the medium to long term. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that the government will incrementally roll back its high fuel subsidies to make way for these renewable sources, which will offer increasing business opportunities. However, in the short term, the government will continue to promote oil and mining production-particularly in the Yasuní region-which may pose long-term threats to environmental stability.
Migration and urbanisation Urbanisation in Ecuador is a relatively recent phenomenon and comparatively low for Latin America. The majority of the population has traditionally lived in rural communities in the mountainous region (sierra). Since crossing the 50% threshold in 1990, the percentage of people living in cities has grown slowly, from about 62% in 2006 to 64% in 2018. The establishment of a middle class under a social spending and consumption-driven economic policy in the 2000s, particularly by the administration of Rafael Correa (2007-17), will sustain a large urban population. Meanwhile, security concerns in the north and environmental degradation in the sierra are likely to accelerate the pace of migration from rural areas to cities in the medium term. The country's infrastructure and natural resources will be strained in the process, necessitating greater investment. There will be opportunities for public-private partnerships for infrastructure investment, but internal migration will also invite limited bouts of social unrest.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2015-19) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2020-24). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2015-19. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2020-24 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2015-19 ranges are then used to derive 2020-24 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2020-24, not to the likely situation in 2024 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2017 or 2022). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - The election held in September 2017 produced a victory for the centre-right bloc. Parties in the ruling coalition since then have changed frequently, with the current government comprising the centre-right Conservatives and two centrist parties, the Liberals and the Christian Democrats, which entered government in January 2018 and January 2019, respectively. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any further changes in the government until the next election in September 2021, as the outbreak of coronavirus has largely suspended normal political activity. With the initial phase of the outbreak largely contained, policy efforts will be focused on gradually re-opening the economy from its March-May lockdown and on mitigating the economic fallout of the crisis. A revival in transmission of the virus in the winter of 2020-21 is highly likely.

- The disruption caused by the coronavirus has yet to be reflected in business environment scores, but in current data, its regional ranking does improve slightly over the forecast period, and its position in regional and global rankings rises to 7th and 12th respectively. Solid economic fundamentals (high GDP per capita, low inflation) should weather the short-term disruption caused by the coronavirus. Norway's high political effectiveness has been proved in a robust response to the crisis, and the country's sound institutions will support recovery from 2021 onwards. Structural advantages, such as recent tax reforms and the country's holdings through its oil wealth, will remain. Nevertheless, high labour costs (a result of the oil sector's influence on the economy) and limited market size will ensure that Norway is outperformed by other Scandinavian economies, such as Denmark and Sweden.

- The coronavirus crisis will lead to a contraction of 5.5% in GDP in 2020. The domestic lockdown imposed from March-May, and its subsequent withdrawal, will curtail economic activity on the mainland. The fiscal support to the labour market will blunt the force of the contraction, but demand will be significantly damaged. The disruption to the mainland economy will be compounded by weakness in the offshore economy. The decline in oil prices in early 2020 will impede investment and weigh on export growth, reducing the current-account surplus in 2020-21. The economy will recover from the second half of 2020 onwards, but real GDP will not return to pre-crisis levels until 2023.

- The demographic outlook is expected to steadily worsen as migration from both eastern Europe and outside Europe wanes in the coming years. Slowing migration will accelerate the steady aging of the population. Nonetheless, net migration will remain positive, with migrants attracted by Norway's high wages and robust social safety net. Compared with other Scandinavian countries, Nor-way's demography is better suited to future growth, with the share of the working-age population higher than in peer countries. Still, the ageing population will put pressure on the pensions and healthcare systems, and the costs of both will steadily climb over the forecast period.

- Market opportunities are constrained by the small size of the population (5.4m in 2019). However, Norwegian households are the sixth-wealthiest in the world, with GDP per head of US$69,213 in 2019 measured in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. Despite this high wealth, consumption growth will remain sluggish compared with neighbouring economies, as investment takes a greater lead in driving growth over the 2020-24 forecast period. Connection to nearby markets is limited, as it is few land borders with its trading partners, preventing it from taking a role as a business or commercial hub for the rest of Europe.

- High labour market participation means that future growth will depend on gains in productivity and investment, both of which will steadily accrue over the forecast period. Diminishing oil and gas reserves will force continued reform of the healthcare and pension systems, with the vast Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG, the sovereign wealth fund) supporting the fiscal balance over this period. Further integration of technology and the steady improvement in the skills of the population will encourage long-term growth.

Background: The Labour Party governed almost continuously in 1935-65 and largely dominated politics until 2001, when a minority coalition comprising the Conservatives, the Christian Democrats (KrF) and the Liberals swept to power. In 2005 Labour returned to office in a centre-left coalition with the Socialist Left Party (SV) and the Centre Party (Sp)-the first majority government for two decades. This coalition lasted until 2009. The September 2013 election led to a regime change, with a minority right-of-centre coalition of the Conservatives and the Progress Party (FrP) taking office. The centre right was re-elected in 2017. The Conservatives and the FrP were joined by the Liberals in January 2018 and by the KrF in January 2019.
Political structure: A general election is held every four years and there is no right of dissolution between elections. Norway uses a modified proportional representation system where 150 out of the 169 members of the unicameral Storting (parliament) are "district mandates" elected by open-list proportional representation. The remaining 19 seats, the "levelling mandates", are distributed only between the parties that get more than 4% of the national vote and whose initial seat count (out of 150) is not proportional to their share of the vote.
Policy issues: The centre-right government will try to mitigate the fallout from the coronavirus crisis on the wider economy and public health. Efforts will also be focused on reducing the negative spillover effects of the lower oil price on wider economic activity and on strengthening the mainland economy. Spending from Norway's oil fund is expected to rise, and withdrawals will exceed the country's fiscal guidelines. Despite a cross-party agreement on tackling climate change, tensions will persist in the Storting over the balance between industrial development and environmental protection.
Taxation: At the start of 2016 most parties agreed on a multi-year corporation tax reduction (from 27% to 23% by 2018) to improve competitiveness in the economy. The government has further reduced this to 22% for 2019. Oil companies pay an additional flat-rate tax of 50% on income derived from the extraction, processing and transport of oil, but benefit from a 78% tax refund on the costs of exploration of oil and gas. The capital-gains tax was cut from 28% to 27% in 2014. The ordinary rate of value-added tax is 25%. The top marginal income tax rate is 54.3% (including employers' social security contributions).
Foreign trade: Oil and gas output and prices greatly affect Norway's trade flows. The petroleum industry contributes about half of total goods export revenue. In 2016 the trade account registered its lowest level since 1999, but has been recovering since. The current-account surplus increased to US$16.1bn in 2019, down from US$31.1bn in the previous year. The trade and current-account balance will remain in surplus throughout the forecast period (2020-24).

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Norway is a multiparty parliamentary democracy, with minority governments, supported by one or more parties in opposition, the norm. The constitution, the second-oldest in the world after the US, provides for a single legislative chamber (Storting; the parliament) of 169 members, with elections every four years. Similar to other Nordic countries, there is a marked left-right divide amongst political parties, and the political system has consolidated into blocs of parties with similar views. Despite this divide, domestic politics is highly collaborative, and produces remarkably stable governments compared with other developed countries. This is in part because parliament does not have the right to call an early election, so spikes in political instability never result in a change of parliamentary arithmetic. Moreover, the Storting uses a committee system for passing legislation, with an emphasis on building cross-party consensus, and only the most contentious policies lead to a parliamentary vote. Extensive powers are also devolved to the 18 counties and 422 municipalities, although a recent "municipal reform" seeks to reduce their number. The centre-right bloc, consisting of four parties-the Conservatives, the Liberals and the Christian Democrats (KrF)-has led government since the 2017 election. Although the coalition fragmented in January 2020, losing its majority, the onset of coronavirus means we expect no government split before the next election, in September 2021.

Political outlook: Political stability The current ruling coalition, comprising the centre-right Conservatives and two small centrist parties-the Liberals and the Christian Democrats (KrF)-is coming to the end of its term in September 2021. The coalition rules as a minority government, with just 61 members in the 169-seat parliament, after the far-right Progress Party (FrP) withdrew from government in January 2020. Owing to the short time until the next general election, the advent of the coronavirus and a consensual political culture, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect a change in government until after the upcoming election.
Despite the government being a minority in parliament, it is able to pass legislation with the backing of the FrP (which has pledged to support it in significant parliamentary votes). The ruling coalition can also rely on the support of other opposition parties (such as the centre-left Labour Party). Although the FrP will probably withdraw its support for the government on most matters, the damage to political stability would be low, as the constitution prohibits a pre-term dissolution of parliament, and therefore a snap election.
In the near term the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has strengthened the stabilising influences on the political outlook. The government is in the process of steadily unwinding its restrictions on social interaction, after being among the first group of European countries to experience a substantial outbreak of the disease. Public support for the ruling parties has strengthened markedly during the crisis, and parliamentary support for the social-distancing legislation has been wide-ranging. Looking ahead, there is a risk that the economic hardship imposed by the lockdown will spur the growth of disruptive, populist move-ments as voters become disenchanted with traditional parties. However, we believe that this would only have a marginal impact on political stability, as the domestic political culture is highly consensus-driven, with frequent collaboration between the government and opposition parties on a range of issues.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Norway's multiparty structure and consensual style of politics tends to deliver well-designed legislation that meets government objectives. Elections are transparent, free and fair, conducted with universal suffrage, and transfers of power have always been accepted. Government institutions are largely free of corruption, with Transparency International, an anti-corruption watchdog, ranking Norway as the seventh-least corrupt country in the world, according to its 2019 Corruption Perceptions Index. These factors make the political system highly effective, characterised by high levels of public trust and political legitimacy.
We expect Norway to retain its high score for government effectiveness, and the country's apparatus to design and implement policy will remain one of its strengths. However, the consensus-driven nature of Norwegian politics curtails the extent of liberal, pro-business reform, and the overweening extent of bureaucracy can stifle government effectiveness.
There is a large amount of devolved power to regional authorities. As European integration has proceeded since 2007, the Storting has taken a more strident role in scrutinising European rules transposed into law as part of Norway's membership of the European Economic Area (EEA). In the context of the UK's exit from the EU, there is clamour in some sections of parliament for a more distant relationship with Europe, particularly within the FrP. However, despite the FrP's support for the ruling coalition within the Storting, we view a substantial revision of Norway's relationship with the EU, either for or against future integration, as unlikely.
Policymaking is centred in Norway's capital, Oslo, but implementation is largely left to regional authorities, which decentralises the government's functions. The system works well, with sub-national government comprised of municipalities and counties that have equal rights and responsibilities, regardless of their size. Functions are divided between these regional branches. Municipal government supervises junior education, health and social care, and town planning and infrastructure. County government oversees development and planning region-wide, including roads, public transport and adult education. The rising role of digital administration has contributed to a steady reduction in red tape across all aspects of government, and successive governments have attempted to make central and municipal administrations more efficient. Despite these efforts, the there remains some differences in digital capabilities amongst the various local governments, with more populous regions, such as Oslo, providing greater digital services than rural regions, such as Troms.
Streamlined regional government has been implemented as of January 2020 A substantial reform of local government was implemented on January 1st 2020 by the Conservatives-led government. Known as "municipal reform" (kommunesammenslaing), it merged Norway's 428 municipalities into 354 and reduced the country's 18 counties into 11, with the intention of reducing the cost and improving the quality of local government services by allowing local government to exploit economies of scale. The measure is similar to that implemented by Denmark in 2007, which was broadly effective in streamlining government administration. Political opposition to the reform remains high, especially in rural areas, and will likely persist until the system is well-established in the coming years. Opposition to the reform is led by the Centre Party, which has increased its popular support since the reforms were announced in 2017. The reforms destabilise some aspects of regional government (such as separating the administrative functions from the governor's office) in the near term, potentially jeopardising effectiveness, but we expect these repercussions to be gradually remedied in the years ahead.
Political outlook: Election watch The next general election will be held in September 2021. The Storting cannot be dissolved before completing a full four-year term, meaning that there is no risk of a snap election.
Although the handling of the coronavirus crisis is likely to shape political preferences in the run-up to the election, it is unclear how much of an effect it will have by September 2021. The governing parties have seen their popular support increase in the wake of the pandemic, a feature common to most countries, but we expect this support to steadily decrease later in the year as the economic fallout from the virus persists. We expect the Labour Party to emerge as the largest party after the election, as is usually the case, but the shape of the eventual government remains uncertain, as cross-party talks after the election largely decide which party will enter government.
Political outlook: International relations Diplomatically, Norway has been untouched by the souring of US-European relations since the election of Donald Trump as US president. Both the US's bilateral trade surplus with Norway and the country's position within NATO as an important member in the North Atlantic region aid relations.
Relations with the EU will remain one of the main foreign policy issues, particu-larly in the light of the UK's vote to leave the bloc. As a member of the European Economic Area, Norway has access to the single market (in exchange for contri-butions to the EU budget), but must accept relevant EU regulations while having limited influence over them. Nevertheless, the trading outlook remains uncertain as the effects of coronavirus dampen demand in Norway's major trading partners.

Norway's score in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings rises from 7.99 in the historical period (2015-19) to 8.28 in the forecast period (2020-24). This lifts the country two places in the global rankings, to 12th position, and one place to, seventh, among its 17 regional peers, although it remains behind Denmark, Sweden and Finland. This projected improvement in the rankings is based on a quarterly assessment made prior to the rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic across Europe; since then, global business cond-itions and economic prospects have weakened considerably. This implies that some scores for the forecast period may be revised down in future, although we still expect Norway's to improve in the rating, owing to its resilient macro-economic fundamentals, stable and transparent regulatory environment, skilled workforce and the lagged impact of reforms, particularly in taxation.
The fallout from the coronavirus pandemic will deliver a significant negative shock to the global economy in 2020; Norway will experience its share of disruption. The length of the crisis and effectiveness of policy support measures will determine how different parts of the economy are affected, but it is likely to have medium-term implications for most parts of the business environment. In the near term planned reforms will be postponed amid a focus on crisis-response measures, particularly in labour markets.
Norway will remain one of the world's best locations for businesses Difficulties related to political turbulence, comparatively high labour costs, an elevated personal tax burden (albeit supporting high-quality public services and social welfare) and limited market opportunities will persist. Nevertheless, Nor-way will remain among the world's leading business locations, underpinned by a strong record of pro-business policy orientation, a welcoming attitude to foreign investment, a low regulatory burden and excellent transport, energy and digital infrastructure.

The coronavirus outbreak will generate a substantial contraction in GDP The Norwegian economy, like its peers, has been severely affected by the global coronavirus pandemic and the impact of temporary lockdown measures, with the country more exposed than most to the related slump in oil prices. A period of higher unemployment, greater business caution, lower oil-sector investment, weakened private-sector balance sheets and subdued global demand is expected in the near term. However, there was firm momentum in the economy prior to the shutdown, supported by competitiveness gains and a robust labour market, and solid macroeconomic fundamentals such as healthy public finances (backed by the Government Pension Fund Global, or GPFG, the vast sovereign wealth fund), a large external surplus, substantial corporate and household savings, low inflation, a resilient financial sector and strong institutional underpinnings. These imply that the Norwegian economy is better positioned than most of its regional peers to recover over the coming years, with limited permanent "scarring effects" from the crisis.
Structurally weaker aspects of the economy are elevated household indebtedness, a frothy housing market, ageing demographics and a still significant dependence on the oil sector (and thus exposure to sudden falls in global demand and the oil price). Against a global backdrop of rising protectionism and trade tensions, as well as shifting environmental perspectives, prospects for medium-term growth are likely to become more closely tied to economic diversification away from oil.

State ownership of strategic assets is higher than other countries Norway offers a robust environment for private enterprise, with a low burden of regulation, strong property rights protection, an effective legal system and support for entrepreneurship. An established framework of competition law was revised in 2016 to harmonise merger control with EU law. The Norwegian Competition Authority (NCA) has proved reasonably effective in its policing of cartels and abuse of market dominance. However, opportunities for private enterprise are more limited than in most other regional economies, reflecting a still fairly high level of direct state ownership in Norway.

- There are about 70 companies under majority state control, including the country's largest oil group (Equinor), largest telecommunications provider (Telenor) and largest financial services institution (DNB). Since 2018 there have been modest divestments of state shareholdings in the air transport and agriculture sectors, where the government has seen no need for continued ownership, but on the whole there will continue to be a significant degree of state influence across the economy. Partly as a result of this, levels of regulation in services vary considerably by sector (although this is also common in many EU countries). According to the OECD, Norway compares favourably in terms of legal, accounting and rail freight transport services, whereas there are fairly high barriers to competition in the insurance, air transport, road freight and const-ruction sectors. Although scope for private enterprise in some product and services markets is restricted, the administrative burden for companies operating in Norway is generally low. According to the World Bank's Doing Business 2020 report, the number of procedures and costs involved to establish a new business in Norway are less than the average for high-income OECD countries (as is also the case in Sweden, Finland and Denmark). Administrative processes involved with the payment of taxes, property registration, cross-border trading, contract enforcement and the process of insolvency also compare favourably with most advanced economies, with some room for improvement in accessing utilities and credit (mostly among small- and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs).

Emergency measures will lead to a large increase in state influence.
- The level of state influence in the economy will increase, at least in the near term, reflecting the emergency policy measures implemented in response to the pandemic. Most measures are designed to be temporary, supporting liquidity for companies and income protection for households, but other schemes-such as state-backed guarantees for the airline sector and state-funded loan support for the wider business sector-imply a longer-term affiliation, raising questions over how this increased level of state involvement will evolve.
- The centre-right government will remain open to the divestment of non-strategic state-owned assets, although market conditions in 2020-21 are unlikely to be that favourable and there are no specific privatisation plans. The state retains significant holdings in major sectors, including Equinor (formerly Statoil, 67%), Telenor (54%); DNB (34%); Yara (36.2%), a fertiliser manufacturer; and Norsk Hydro (34.3%), an aluminium producer. Statkraft, a renewable-energy company, and Statskog, a forestry and land-management company, remain fully public.

There is a slight improvement in Norway's regional ranking for policies toward foreign investment, mostly driven by a protectionist turn among other European economies. Given its small economy, Norway has long adopted a co-operative stance towards foreign investors, abiding by its obligations as an EEA member and broadly welcoming foreign capital and expertise. Mirroring global trends, political and public resistance to foreign influence is on the rise, but restrictions on foreign ownership are fairly limited, applying mainly to strategic industries (including parts of fisheries, maritime and transport) and some natural resources. The gradual long-term depletion of offshore hydrocarbon reserves and recent oil-price slumps have given some impetus to efforts to attract FDI as a means of diversifying the economy and complementing the offshore energy sector with new sources of wealth. Focus areas for Invest in Norway, the official investment promotion agency, include renewable energy, "cleantech", biotechnology and a growing professional services sector, especially ICT. There have been pockets of progress, but on the whole diversification efforts have not been as fruitful as the government had hoped, with the hydrocarbon sector still among the most appealing for foreign investors. Norway does not offer significant tax benefits to investors (domestic or foreign), but selective start-up grants and R&D support are available, with additional incentives for projects in less populated areas of the country.
National security will play a larger role in foreign investment decisions
- Most FDI inflows to Norway originate from EU countries, with Sweden and the Netherlands the two biggest investors. An increased emphasis in recent years on attracting FDI from the US, China and other parts of Asia is expected to continue over the forecast period, although prospective inflows will face greater scrutiny than before following the government's adoption of a new investment screening regime in 2019. This gives the authorities power to investigate and block foreign acquisitions (from EU and non-EU investors) on the grounds of national security, national financial stability and autonomy. This is similar to a new FDI screening framework in the EU, where there has been a steady pushback in recent years against non-EU inflows, mainly from China, amid gears over the transfer of intellectual property and the involvement of state-owned actors in strategic infrastructure assets. Broadly, the changes reflect a general trend in many countries of rising political interference in business acquisitions.

Privatisation programmes will steadily increase over the forecast
- Privatisation of certain railway routes will continue over the forecast period. In 2018 a British transport provider, Go-Ahead, won the first competitive tender for Norway's rail operations, covering the Sorlandet line to Stavanger and Arendal line services for a ten-year period. In mid-2019 a Swedish operator, SJ, won the rights to an additional seven routes. We expect a gradual widening of public-private collaboration in Norwegian infrastructure, including rail infrastructure, in accordance with the 12-year transport plan (2018-29).
- Support for foreign investment on the Norwegian continental shelf is likely to remain generous, especially in light of the coronavirus-related slump in oil prices and likely postponement of some oil-investment projects. Foreign and domestic investors receive equal treatment in the awarding of new blocks for exploration and production of oil and gas, based on annual licensing rounds that cover more mature parts of the shelf (awards in predefined areas, APAs) and licensing rounds held every two years in more risky frontier areas. Regarding the latter, in June 2018 the government offered 12 new production licences to 11 companies in the 24th licensing round, with nine of the licences focused on the Barents Sea and three in the Norwegian Sea. The number of applicant companies fell to 11, from 26 in the previous round in 2016. A coalition agreement that enforces a ban on exploring for oil off the Lofoten, Senja and Vesteralen islands will continue to be upheld through the parliament's term to 2021.

Energy exports comprise the bulk of Norway's trade in Europe As Norway is a net energy exporter, with a small domestic market and limited manufacturing capacity, governments of all persuasions have adopted broadly pro-free-trade policies, despite a long-standing reluctance to join the EU and the protectionism afforded to home-produced agriculture. The deterioration in the regional and global rankings reflects not only the progress made in some other countries and the lack of improvement in Norway's trade openness owing its remote location and undiversified export base, but also the steady worsening in global trading conditions amid increased protectionism and weaker demand. Trade openness notwithstanding, Norway's institutions are largely welcoming to trade. Except in extremis, investors in Norway are guaranteed the absence of foreign-exchange controls, with an independent central bank overseeing a free-floating krone. Profits and dividends earned in all economic sectors, including oil and gas, may be repatriated, with no restrictions on capital flows. Through Norway's membership of the EEA, Norwegian and foreign-owned companies in Norway gain full access to the single market, which accounts for around 60% of all Norwegian exports. EU access guarantees the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital between Norway and member states. Norway adopts around three-quarters of all single-market legislation, with notable exceptions being laws that govern agriculture and fisheries (the fisheries industry is among the biggest in Europe). Trading outside the EU is promoted mainly through the European Free-Trade Association (EFTA) by negotiating free-trade agreements (FTAs). As of June 2020 there were 29 FTAs covering 41 countries, with talks ongoing over future deals with India, Malaysia and Thailand, among others. After a six-year hiatus, in 2016 Norway resumed negotiations with China over a bilateral FTA. Norway followed the EU's lead in placing sanctions on Russia since 2014, resul-ting in a Russian ban on EU (and Norwegian) food imports.

- Norway's position on the fringe of European institutions is unlikely to change. It is not a member of the EU and will not consider joining over the forecast period, as an increasing number of parties oppose membership. There have been calls by the far-right FrP to renegotiate the terms of Norway's EEA membership, but centrist parties within the ruling coalition and the example of Brexit make the prospect of wider renegotiation unlikely.

Bilateral trade agreements will remain the priority for both Norway and the EU
- We expect a more volatile and strained global trading environment over the forecast period. The fallout from the coronavirus pandemic will not only impart a severe negative shock to the world economy and trade flows in 2020, but is also likely to exacerbate many existing geopolitical trends, such as growing US-China tensions, the rise in nationalist anti-globalist policies and the shift in the economic balance of power from West to East. This implies a risk of a rise in EU-US trade tensions and a more challenging backdrop in which to manage EU-China relations, as well as expected disruption to trade from a "hard" Brexit.
- Amid a fraying multilateral trade system, the focus of the EU and Norway will be on bilateral deals. In recent years the EU has finalised FTAs with Canada, Singapore, Vietnam and Japan, upgraded its deal with Mexico and launched trade talks with Australia and New Zealand. A provisional agreement was reached in mid-2019 between the EU and Mercosur (the South American trading bloc) to create the world's largest free-trade market of almost 800m people, after 20 years of talks. However, amid concerns in some member states over aspects of the deal (mostly on agriculture and climate), there are doubts as to whether the agreement will be finalised and implemented from 2021, as first intended. Prior to the pandemic, progress in Norway-China FTA negotiations had raised the prospect of a deal by end-2020, but this is now less certain.

Tax reforms have made Norway more competitive in recent years The tax regime has tradionally been among the weaker areas of the business environment, but reforms over recent years have improved the country's relative standing at a global and regional level. The focus has been on developing a more competitive tax system and shifting part of the overall burden from direct to less distortionary indirect taxation, via reductions to personal and corporate income tax rates, introduction of a new financial activities tax (in 2017) and a sugar tax (in 2018) and changes in excise duties. In 2018 Norway had a tax-to-GDP ratio of 39%, down from an average of around 42% in 2000-15 and the ninth highest in the OECD.

- The share of total tax receipts from personal and corporate income taxes and social security contributions remains moderately higher than the OECD average, whereas the proportion of revenue from taxes on property and non-VAT indirect taxes is below average. Between 2014 and 2019 the headline corporate income tax rate was lowered from 27% to the current 22%, which is close to the effective tax rates among Norway's regional peers and broadly on a par with the OECD. Further corporate income tax rates are levied on offshore petroleum companies (56% in 2020) and on hydropower production (37%). These headline rates have risen moderately in recent years, but effective tax rates have remained largely unchanged, as the tax rate of investment-based depreciation, the "rate of uplift", has been gradually lowered. The income tax system for individuals was reformed in 2016, with a progressive four-tier framework replacing a surtax that was levied only on the highest earners. This has been accompanied in recent years by a reduction in the flat tax rate levied on all net income, from 27% to the current 22%, an increase in the personal allowance and a tightening of various exemptions. As at January 2020 the four income tax rates ranged from 1.9% above personal income of Nkr180,000 (US$18,650) to 16.2% on income above Nkr999,550. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a standard rate of 25%, but reduced rates of 15%, 12% and 0% apply to a wide range of goods and services.
- The centre-right minority government had targeted further modest downward pressure on the tax burden in 2020-21, but reform plans are now highly uncertain amid the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. As part of its policy response to the crisis, the government temporarily deferred some corporate tax payments, offered tax relief to the airline sector and reduced the "lower" VAT rate from 12% to 8% until October 2020.

Further tax cuts could form part of any fiscal stimulus later this year
- Additional tax-cutting stimulus is possible in the near term to support the hardest-hit sectors and prompt a broader recovery in demand. The scale and timing of such measures will be influenced by the future path of the virus and also global oil prices. Norway is less dependent on the hydrocarbons sector than a decade ago, but this remains an important driver of tax revenue and activity in the mainland economy. Tax incentives for the sector could be introduced, aimed at mitigating an anticipated decline in oil investment. Norway has more fiscal space than most countries, but the crisis could lead to policymakers seeking new sources of tax revenue over the coming years. This could include a withholding tax on interest and royalty payments, a broadening of the VAT base or a tightening of generous housing tax incentives.

Financial stability is guaranteed by well-supervised and funded banks Financing conditions for business are favourable, with Norway ranked highest on a regional basis and sharing the top spot with two other countries at a global level. This reflects the underlying resilience of its banking sector, comparatively modest risk exposure, access to a range of financing channels and recent improvements to the regulatory framework. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, annual stress tests showed the banking sector to be more profitable than most regional peers, with strong capital and liquidity buffers (an average common equity Tier 1 ratio of near 16% in mid-2019 was comfortably above minimum capital requirements under Basel III) and a low level of credit losses. Risks to financial stability mainly stem from banks' exposure to the oil and gas sector, overvalued domestic housing and commercial real estate markets and elevated levels of household debt.

- Banks also remain fairly reliant on wholesale funding and the tightly integrated nature of the Nordic-Baltic banking system implies a moderate spillover risk. In recent years macroprudential measures aimed at strengthening capital buffers and tightening rules on consumer credit and higher-risk mortgage lending (particularly in the largest cities, such as Oslo) have been introduced, which have contributed to slower growth in bank lending and house prices. Since late 2018 revelations of a major money-laundering scandal involving some of the largest Nordic-Baltic banking groups have prompted a tightening of anti-money laundering and terrorism financing legislation across the region. Foreign companies have access to the same capital sources as domestic companies, but often work through foreign banks, which tend to have offices in Oslo, the capital, and in cities where the oil industry is based, especially Bergen and Stavanger. Access to investment finance is adequate, as tighter rules were established in the wake of the global financial crisis. Companies are able to obtain bank funding (subject to risk limits) and can also access the equity or bond markets, which-owing to the government's strong fiscal position-are more stable than in many other countries. Foreign-exchange access will remain unhindered as authorities maintain a free-float currency with no capital controls.
- Norewegian banks are well positioned to absorb a rise in credit losses and a hit to profitability, but the resilience of the finanical sector will be tested by the fallout from the pandemic. A sharp hit to the mainland economy, a jump in non-performing loans amid higher unemployment and business failures, a drag from low global oil prices and reduced oil- ector investment, a hit to bank profitability from lower official interest rates and a period of increased financial market volatility will weigh on lenders' balance sheets, exposing areas of weakness and reducing willingness to provide credit.

Monetary support have been substantially increased since February
- In response to the crisis, Norges Bank reduced its official policy interest rate from 1.5% to a record low 0% (it stated that it does not envisage a negative policy rate) and implemented initiatives to boost liquidity, including temporarily unrestricted access to short-term loans, additional foreign-currency swap auctions and a cut in banks' countercyclical capital buffer from 2.5% to 1% (in effect releasing new liquidity from banks' capital reserves). The government also launched loan-guarantees amounting to Nkr100bn: a scheme specifically aimed at new bank loans to SMEs and a reintroduced Government Bond Fund.
- In the near term there will a marked slowdown in overall loan demand, with bank financing of existing SMEs and new start-ups declining. Over the forecast period we expect an increase in take-up of non-bank funding alternatives, including debt and equity markets, venture capital and securitisation.

High standards of tertiary education and vocational training have helped to develop a highly skilled labour force in managerial expertise and language skills. Central-level bargaining between government, the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise and the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions involves a high degree of co-ordination, with blue-collar manufacturing wages providing the bench-mark for sector-specific and company-level bargaining. The more restrictive elements of this system, such as a large public sector and some scarcity of skills in the private sector, had become more evident prior to the coronavirus pandemic. Following a jump in unemployment as a result of the crisis, the focus in the near term will be on responding to a weaker jobs market (with significant disruption in certain sectors such as retail, hospitality and tourism) through active labour market policies such as subsidised jobs, training and job-search support.

- A relative lack of labour mobility will restrict opportunities for development in remote regions, and relatively low skill levels among imm-igrants and asylum-seekers settling in Norway will hamper integration into the workforce. Political pressure to restrict migration will also remain high, stifling any surge in labour supply later in the forecast period as the economy strengthens. High aspirations for wages and entitlements contribute to workforce welfare, but also add to business operating costs. Strike action is a familiar feature of the wage-bargaining process in the public sector and among offshore petroleum industry workers seeking higher rates and benefits, which contributes to the lower score on this category. However, the government reserves the right to enforce arbitration in disputes that are likely to have a major impact on the economy or be detrimental to public health. Although occasional industrial action has taken place in recent years, we expect future action to be largely avoided through arbitration.

Recent stimulus measures have been focussed on the labour market
- The government introduced various temporary measures in response to the pandemic aimed at mitigating the rise in permanent unemployment. Companies were able to temporarily furlough employees, with the state covering a proportion of related wage costs. A similar income-protection scheme was also available for self-employed workers, alongside rapid (and expanded) access to sickness and unemployment benefits. The level of registered unemployment surged from 2.2% in February 2020 to almost 11% in March, but had fallen back to 6.4% at end-May. Further declines will be more gradual, with unemployment in Norway unlikely to return to pre-crisis levels until 2023.
- Against a backdrop of stricter immigration controls and divergent sectoral trends, concerns over skills shortages have been a feature of certain pockets of the labour market for some time. Although at an aggregate level such concerns will ease as a result of the pandemic, amid a period of weaker overall activity and higher joblessness, the fallout from the downturn and the inequitable damage to some sectors risks contributing to a further mismatch of demand and supply, including in healthcare, engineering, construction and ICT.

Norway has well developed physical transport networks and high-quality digital infrastructure, with few of the problems, such as traffic congestion, that affect countries with higher population densities. Gradual improvements to road and rail networks are scheduled over the forecast period, based on a new ten-year national transport plan published in 2018, but overall we expect Norway's fairly high score and rankings for this category to remain largely unchanged. Good ferry and internal air transport services, including oil-rig helicopter links, help to mitigate the logistical challenges posed by Norway's diverse topography and weather-related vulnerabilities. Rock fall, flooding and landslide risks, alongside the ongoing requirement to increase the connectivity of cities and regions, place constant demands on the public purse to maintain roads, bridges and tunnels, and rail, air and maritime transport systems, as well as public transport links. However, the unpopularity of road tolls, which are an important source of funding for Norwegian infrastructure, are becoming a more salient political issue. Norway's digital infrastructure is among the most highly advanced in the world. In recent years many rapidly growing start-ups have emerged, and almost all services available digitally. Telecommunications coverage and quality is high, with providers reasonably quick to roll out imp-rovements to the high-speed broadband network.
A National Transport Plan, published in 2018, directs infrastructure spending
- Infrastructure policy will be guided by the National Transport Plan for 2018-29, which focuses on the maintenance and upgrading of transport infrastructure, pollution reduction, and stronger public-private co-operation, as well as increased use of intelligent transport systems and digitisation. The plan's baseline scenario allocates 58% of a total budget of Nkr418m (US$46m) for road improvements; 32% for railways (which includes new double-track lines for intercity routes, Oslo-Skien and Halden-Lillehammer, and a second light-rail line in Bergen, to Fyllingsdalen, a borough in the south of the city); and another 3% to sea infrastructure to benefit the fishing and shipping industries.
- Telenor launched Norway's first commercial 5G mobile services in March 2020, with its main competitor, Telia, switching on its 5G network in May. Availability of services will initially be limited, but the two main operators are targeting about 50% population coverage by 2021 and nationwide coverage by 2023, supported by allocation of increased spectrum by the National Communications Authority (Nkom). In May 2020 parliament approved a new Broadband Development Act, which aims to facilitate the development of ultrafast broadband networks and 5G rollout by encouraging co-operation in infrastructure construction and promoting joint utilisation of existing networks.

Norway performs reasonably well on the technological readiness ranking and we expect gradual improvements over the forecast period, raising its global and regional standing. Stronger aspects are the quality of its digital infrastructure; high adoption rates of e-commerce and e-business technology; good penetration of e-government services; widespread internet usage; and above-average digital skill levels. There is more room for improvement in cyber-security preparedness, research and development (R&D) spending and the quality of the country's research infrastructure, although these are still satis-factory on a regional basis. Total investment in R&D corresponds to just over 2% of GDP-slightly below an OECD average of 2.4% and well below levels of 3.1% in Denmark and 3.2% in Sweden. Norway ranks in the second-highest group as a "strong innovator" in the European Innovation Scoreboard, scoring particularly well for its innovation-friendly environment, strong public-private linkages and lifelong learning (aided by Norway's flexible education system). Weaker aspects include a below-average impact from sales and exports of knowledge-intensive products, implying scope for improvement in translating the country's strong innovative capacity into increased entrepreneurial activity.
A cyber-attack on an energy supplier led to a national plan for cyber-security
- In May 2019, in response to the increasing prevalence of cyber-security attacks (exemplified by an attack on Norsk Hydro, a state-backed energy supplier, in March 2019), the government unveiled a national cyber-security strategy. This strategy places further emphasis on public-private collaboration across both civilian and military branches of government, with the aim of safeguarding national infrastructure against cyber-security threats.
- Public-private partnership will be an increasing theme in technology research initiatives, in line with many other developed economies. In August 2018 some of Norway's biggest companies announced that they would jointly establish a national powerhouse for artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the country's quality and capacity for research, education and innovation in the field. The government has actively supported these partnerships, as it encour-ages the matching of technical skills to business need, reducing the extent of skills mismatches and raising productivity. However, their effect on innovation and the extent of spillovers to other industries is yet to be established.

Economic forecast: Policy trends Having passed the first stages of the pandemic ahead of neighbouring countries, the government's chief policy objective is to steadily unwind the controls imposed from March 12th onwards. Government policy has been more stringent than in neighbouring Sweden, with enforced closures of schools, businesses and public events, alongside restrictions on population movement (specifically from urban to rural areas).
Controls on cross-border movement were also implemented, with closures imposed on the land borders to neighbouring Russia and Finland. These actions have been largely successful in arresting the spread of the virus, and the number of new cases has remained extremely low since May 24th. The government is implementing a steady withdrawal of social-distancing controls from April 20th, schools have been fully re-opened since May 11th, with bars and restaurants allowed to re-open on June 1st, provided they enforce dist-ancing measures among consumers. However, the trajectory of future policy remains uncertain and is likely to depend on the stresses in the public health system (especially in rural areas) and on the spread of the virus nationally.
Although most of the economy will be free of lockdown restrictions, significant controls on the population (including border closures and restrictions on the number of people allowed to enter bars and restaurants) will probably remain in place until July at the earliest. A revival in infections as controls are lifted remains a substantial risk to the forecast and would certainly slow the normalisation of activity, perhaps leading to a re-imposition of controls later this year. However, improvements in the capacity of the healthcare system and in the government's ability to trace and quarantine the infected (through the use of voluntary applications) will curtail the spread in the virus compared with its early stages.

General government debt 40.3 52.7 55.3 55.7 56.3 57.2
Like other European countries, Norway has announced fiscal stimulus in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, although this is much smaller than in peer economies. Total new measures have amounted to about Nkr160bn (US$13.7bn), or about 5.5% of mainland GDP. The budget that the government presented in October 2019 has been abandoned as the disruption from the coronavirus generates a dual shock to both the mainland and oil sectors. The government's new budget, presented on May 13th, targets a substantial with-drawal from the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG; 4.2% of its value) to fund further expenditure. This will be sufficient to pull the fiscal balance into deficit in 2020, for the first time since 1993, but Norway's history of fiscal rectitude and the presence of the GPFG, Norway's vast sovereign wealth fund, will keep the deficit modest, at just 0.9% of GDP in 2020.
Existing government support for the labour market is similar to the measures implemented in response to the coronavirus in neighbouring countries. Under the system of " permittering", the government temporarily pays a large portion (more than 60%) of the wages of workers who are placed on furlough. Expanded take-up of this scheme, although it will preserve much of the existing labour market for the duration of the pandemic, will leave the government liable for a significant increase in spending.
On the employer side, fiscal support has expanded rapidly. The government has deferred tax payments and purchased corporate bonds on the secondary market, reducing borrowing costs for businesses. About Nkr20bn has been set aside as a crisis fund to cover fixed costs for businesses during the coronavirus pandemic, modelled on the Danish fund set up for this purpose. Norway has also established a fund to subsidise healthcare provision in developing countries affected by the coronavirus.

10-year government bond yield (av) 1.5 1.0 1.2 1.3 1.5 1.7
In response to the substantial disruption caused by the pandemic, Norges Bank (the central bank) has lowered the policy rate by 150 basis points since February, to 0%-the lowest rate in modern history. This unprecedented mone-tary easing was completed over three meetings of the monetary policy committee. The first meeting, on March 13th, lowered the policy rate from 1.5% to 1%. The second, on March 20th, lowered it to 0.25%. In May the rate fell further, to 0%. The central bank also lowered countercyclical capital buffers for major banks from 2.5% to 1% to ensure bank solvency and expand credit growth.
As the economic fallout from the virus becomes more profound, we expect Norges Bank to maintain its highly accommodative policy until the end of 2021. There are likely to be substantial scarring effects on both output and employment from the virus, and the looser monetary policy will be required to accelerate the recovery in the near term. The possible recurrence of the virus in the winter will make the central bank less inclined to normalise rates.
Looking ahead, Norges Bank targets inflation of "close to 2% over time", and the policy rate should rise steadily as the economy recovers. Nevertheless, its mandate is flexible to ensure stable output and employment, and to avoid the build-up of financial imbalances. The steady rise in the oil price, the gradual recovery of the domestic economy and the revival in global trade should all generate a steady normalisation of interest rates over the forecast period.

Economic forecast: Economic growth The impact of the coronavirus: global and regional assumptions The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecasts are built on a series of epidemiological assumptions on the novel coronavirus (Covid-19). Without rapid access to a vaccine, we expect that the disease will eventually infect up to 30% of the world's population. We assume that about 15% of symptomatic cases will be severe and that up to 1% of symptomatic cases will prove fatal.. Death ratios will depend on a country's ability to detect, track and contain the virus, and the capacity of the national health system. Governments are lifting restrictions on freedom of movement gradually in countries where the number of cases is falling and where there is sufficient spare capacity in the healthcare system. Some countries may be forced to re-impose measures if cases spike again. Based on previous viral outbreaks and the progress made on other coronavirus vaccines (such as that for severe acute respiratory syndrome-SARS), we expect a vaccine to be available by end-2021.
In economic terms, we forecast that global output will contract by 4.2% year on year in 2020 and that global trade will decline by 24.8%. Global GDP will not recover to pre-coronavirus levels before at least 2022; 2020 and 2021 will be lost years for growth. Real GDP will contract in all regions of the world, but the drop in output will be especially severe in OECD countries. All G7 countries and almost all G20 countries will experience a full-year recession in 2020. We expect China's real GDP growth to slow sharply to 1% this year, and forecast a full-year recession in the US, with a contraction of 4%. We assume that oil prices will decline by more than 40% this year, to average US$38/barrel. Most countries have responded with huge fiscal expansion to support businesses and households, raising the risk of sovereign debt crises in the medium term. Central banks have cut interest rates and, more importantly, have stepped up as buyers of last resort for government and corporate debt.
Europe is heading towards a historic recession this year. Most governments started to relax some of the rules governing social and economic behaviour in May, but economic activity will remain greatly impeded. We assume that the worst of the economic damage will occur in the second quarter of 2020, when most economies have been subject to the strictest containment measures. The euro zone will register a full-year recession in 2020, with a forecast contraction in GDP of 8%, as output in all of the bloc's economies will contract. Supply-side effects include disrupted global supply chains, a sharp fall in working hours and a spike in business failures. Demand-side effects are likely to be longer lasting. Even once lockdowns are eased, people are likely to avoid public spaces for fear of contagion and to hold off on travel plans. Households will limit their consumption in response to a loss of income, and businesses will delay investment. We expect a bounce-back in the third quarter, after the outbreak has peaked, but confidence will remain subdued.
The political and geopolitical impact of the crisis will be significant. The pandemic has resulted in an extraordinary expansion of executive powers, with limited parliamentary oversight. Elections have been cancelled in some countries. When the pandemic has passed, governments will face intense scrutiny on their response. Failure to address the humanitarian crisis triggered by the coronavirus could further erode trust in national institutions. A severe global economic crisis, followed by large-scale unemployment, could fuel a new wave of popular protests. The crisis may encourage support for the nation state and a backlash against globalisation and open borders. It will also intensify the competition for global leadership between China and the US, and a realignment of geopolitical spheres of influence may ensue in Europe, Africa and other regions.

Despite the shift in policy towards a steady easing of lockdown restrictions, the gradual pace of withdrawal throughout the second quarter of 2020 will guarantee a contraction in both the first and second quarters of the year. Subsequently, we believe that the economy will rebound only in the latter half of 2020 as control measures subside and economic activity improves, bringing full-year output down by 5.5% from 2019. There remains a high risk that the rate of viral infection will increase as the social-distancing measures are withdrawn, prompting a re-imposition of controls later in the year. We judge that long-term scarring from the crisis will be significant, but modest compared with peer economies, as government support for short-term disruption to the labour market will remain substantial.
The coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent lockdown will primarily impact consumer spending and export demand in Norway, which we expect to decline by 6.9% and 11.8% respectively. On the consumption side, the imposition of social-distancing measures damages consumer spending both directly, through the prevention of consumer activities such as services spending, and indirectly, through a decline in total employment and consumer spending power. On the external side, similar lockdowns among major trading partners (namely the UK and Germany) will weigh on demand for major exports, such as energy goods and shipping.
Although Norway is sheltered from the worst effects of the economic shutdown owing to its fairly small tourism industry (at just 4% of GDP), its large export sector and debt-laden household balance sheets make it vulnerable to a prolonged lull in economic activity. Government intervention, primarily through state-sponsored loans and support for the labour market, will lessen the extent of the economic fallout, but will not prevent substantial contractions early in 2020.
Investment in both the oil and non-oil sectors will also weaken, as uncertainty around a possible recurrence of the virus (at least until a vaccine is produced) will chill investor appetite for risk and cuts in oil sector production will weigh on the returns of offshore projects. Growth will recover more substantially from 2021 onwards as economic life returns to normal and the risk of a re-imposition of controls steadily abates. However, the prospect of lasting damage to household balance sheets (with household debt at 110% of GDP in December 2019), business confidence and oil investment will keep real GDP below pre-crisis levels until 2022.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends Norway's sectoral balance has changed only modestly since the exploitation of the country's oil reserves in the 1970s, which placed the oil and gas industry in a prime position in the Norwegian economy, composing about a fifth of GDP in 2018. As in most developed economies, the services sector is the mainstay of Norway's output, contributing about 65% to the country's GDP in 2019. This share is below Norway's peer economies in Scandinavia: Finland and Denmark's share of services output is 69.7% and 74.4% respectively. The size of other sectors in the economy, (outside of oil) is fairly small, at just 2.2% for agriculture; and 5.9% for manufacturing.
Services command less of a share of output than in other Nordic countries The oil and gas sector has been the main driver of economic development since Norwegian oil was first exploited in the 1970s. Early phases of oil exploration took place in the North Sea (on the country's west coast) but later efforts have concentrated on the Barents Sea (to the north). Historically, the influence of the oil sector has been in steady decline, and the size of the oil sector has fallen from a peak of 25% of GDP in 2012 to 15% in 2019, owing to falling oil prices and disrupted production on major oil platforms. The corona-virus outbreak will keep oil prices low over the forcast period, but the re-activation of important oil platforms after maintenance operations and the development of new platforms will boost oil production over in the next five years. By year-end 2019, 88 fields were producing-slightly more than in 2018 (when there were 83). This includes Johan Sverdrup, the fifth-largest oil discovery ever made in Norwegian waters, which will account for 30% of all Norwegian oil production by the mid-2020s, according to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), a government agency. These factors will encourage continued growth in oil production, to a peak in 2023, albeit not to the same scale as the early peak in the mid-2000s. Despite the revival in offshore activity in the near term, various factors will curtail growth in the oil sector in the coming years. The collapse in oil prices, caused by the coronavirus outbreak, will curtail the appetite for new oil sector projects. Oil firms will also face the rising costs of de-commissioning aging oil platforms, weighing on the sector's profitability. Diversification of global energy demand away from oil and gas will also erode prices and curtail new investment.
Support for the oil sector is also becoming less politically desirable for various reasons. Firstly, the damaging effects of the sharp decline in the oil prices since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic has emphasised the need for economic diversification away from oil. Secondly, strengthening environmental concerns will further influence government policy. Since the withdrawal of the pro-oil Progress Party from government in 2020, the environmentalist Liberals have greater influence over government policy, and could use legislation to constrain the growth of the oil sector over time. Thirdly, the generous tax system for oil exploration, which refunds 78% of oil exploration costs, has come under mounting pressure within the usually pro-oil Labour Party. These growing pressures will constrain the oil sector's influence on the economy beyond 2023.
Since the exploitation of oil, Norway's manufacturing sector has receded in economic importance, from 17.7% in 1970, according to the World Bank, to 5.9% in 2019. This decline has been more pronounced than that of Norway's peer economies. Denmark, Sweden and Finland all have manufacturing sectors that comprise more than 12% of GDP. Manufacturing is split between an oil-oriented component, dominated by machinery, chemicals and ship-building, and a consumer-oriented component, based on production of food and beverages. The sector is highly capital intensive so the effects of the coronavirus will be muted compared to other sectors in the economy (particularly the services sector),as it is able to increase production with social-distancing measures in place. Manufacturing may receive further support as part of government plans to diversify the economy further in the years ahead. Nevertheless, the perpetually strong krone, making exports expensive, will curtail the extent of this wider recovery in the manufacturing industry.
The services sector will bear the brunt of the damage caused by coronavirus The services sector, although small compared to peer economies, is the largest in terms of both activity and employment, making up roughly 79% of the labour force. As in other advanced economies, public administration (health and education for example) accounts for the largest share of total employment, at about 35% in 2019, but other services industries, such as real estate, retail and transportation also play a sizeable role. Much of the sector services the internal market, but there are numerous service industries that have developed a significant advantage compared to their European and global competitors. Given Norway's geographical location and the influence of the oil industry, these tend to be firms specialising in logistics or research and development.
Partnership with the oil sector has also enabled transport and maritime services, alongside other professional or technical services (such as engineering, chemicals and research), to develop outside the oil sector, and Norwegian firms such as Aker ASA and Yara International can compete globally. The outbreak of the virus, and the resulting lockdown, will deal substantial damage to the services sector for an extended period. Activity in contact-intensive services such as retail or tourism is likely to be severely curtailed in the first half of 2020, but as their overall size is small compared with neighbouring economies, the total scale of the fallout will be reduced. Activity in less contact-intensive services, such as shipping, is likely to rebound alongside movements in global trade and oil demand.

The price effects from the coronavirus lockdown have proved mixed so far, with the collapse in energy prices and in demand for luxury goods being balanced by a rise in household stockpiling of essential goods (particularly in food and other consumable items). The conflicting effects of the crisis have been borne out in the inflation statistics. Headline inflation fell from 1.8% in January to 0.7% in March, whereas core inflation (excluding energy) has remained elevated at more than 2% throughout this period.
Looking ahead, we expect that the disruptive effects of the coronavirus will drag down inflation in 2020, to an average of 0.2%. This downward trend will be supported by an easing in household stockpiling as controls on social distancing abate, and as the fall in oil prices (which we expect to average $36/b this year) ripples through the economy. Although the downward movement in the krone could generate an uptick in inflation owing to higher import costs, we judge that this will only partially countervail the deflationary effects of the fall in demand.

The krone has largely matched the substantial changes in global energy markets since January. Since December 2019, the krone has depreciated by roughly 8.5% on a trade-weighted basis, as the price of oil has collapsed and economic activity has slowed.
Although the krone has strengthened from its nadir in March (when it had depreciated by over 17% since December), conditions of subdued demand and slower growth are likely to prevent the krone from fully returning to its December value until 2024, when oil prices have recovered, and production is restored. Further downward shocks to oil prices, chiefly from shocks to global demand, remain a risk to our exchange-rate forecast.

Norway's current-account surpluses are structurally supported by large inflows in the trade and primary income accounts, respectively reflecting the economy's position as a major oil exporter and the size of the GPFG.
Although inflows in both of these components will be damaged by the economic fallout from the coronavirus, we do not expect either of these accounts to fall into deficit. Oil exports will be damaged by the proposed cuts to production, but we expect that this will be balanced by the reduction in goods imports, keeping the trade balance in surplus despite the fall in oil prices.
As the coronavirus abates, steady rises in oil prices from 2021 onwards will further support the trade balance, and increases in production (barring any government intervention) will continue throughout the forecast period. We expect that this, combined with a revival of growth in major trading partners (particularly the UK and Germany), will support a rise in the current-account surplus over the forecast period, to 5.6% of GDP in 2024.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Norway Stocks and flows Inward foreign direct investment (FDI) had been elevated prior to the sharp fall in oil prices in 2014, averaging US$18.7bn in 2007-12, with significant declines in the wake of the financial crisis and alongside fluctuations in the oil market. After the drop in oil prices in 2014, inward FDI flows weakened greatly, turning negative in 2016, at the nadir of the oil sector's performance. Inward flows also turned sharply negative in 2018, and The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the coronavirus pandemic to cause a surge in divestment in 2020, before a steady recovery from 2021 onwards, back to net inflows by 2022. However, these inflows are unlikely to reach pre-2014 levels. By end-2019 stocks of inward FDI stood at US$251.5bn, or about 62% of GDP, although this will rise to about 65% by 2024. At US$46,955, FDI per head remains above that of the EU15 and many peer Nordic economics, with Finland and Sweden at US$23,919 and US$46,196 respectively.
Origin and distribution Norway's oil-intensive economy means that FDI is largely focused on the oil and gas sector, in addition to ancillary services such as transport, infrastructure and finance. Most of the world's major oil and gas companies are involved in Norwegian oil production, including Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Marathon (all US-based), BP, Shell (both UK), Eni (Italy), RWE Dea (Germany) and Engie (France). FDI data for 2018, released by Statistics Norway, show that about 24% of all FDI goes to mining and quarrying (including the oil sector), whereas manufacturing, the next highest recipient, gets 15.2%. Financial services are also an important beneficiary of foreign investment, taking about 10.9%. Both manufacturing and financial services have considerable overlap with the oil and gas sector. The bulk of Norwegian FDI has its origins in fellow European countries, with the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK in the top five investor countries, with these three jointly accounting for about 40% of all FDI in Norway. The US has become a more prominent investor in Norway in recent years, now holding 15% of all foreign investment in 2018-higher than the 9% held by the US in 2014.
Determinants The Norwegian government operates a system to encourage and regulate the exploitation of oil within its waters (the country has no onshore oil production). To ensure that the exploration of oil is intensive in previously explored, or "mature", areas, the government awards licences for the exploration of these regions annually-as opposed to unexplored, "frontier", areas, for which licences are awarded once every two years. This awards system has been in place since 2003 and comes with a taxation system, in place since 2005, which rewards exploration but penalises excessive production. The government imposes a special additional tax of 51%, on top of an oil-sector tax rate of 27%, on wells that are producing oil-higher than the marginal tax rate for UK oil producers, which stands at 40%. This high rate of taxation is compensated by a feature that enables upstream companies to write off 78% of losses on oil exploration if the search for oil proves unsuccessful. The presence of oil has led to high FDI stocks, but an onerous tax burden, high wages, Norway's limited market size and high house prices are all factors that restrain further growth in foreign investment. The constraint posed by Norway's small market size is partly mitigated by Norway's membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), which gives Norwegian firms access to the European market. However, this trade access is made slightly more uncertain by Norway's retention of its own currency, the krone, which moves alongside fluctuations in the oil price and adds to exchange-rate risk.
Impact FDI has encouraged a sustained transfer of foreign knowledge to Norway and has accelerated the development of the oil and gas sector. The oil sector has, in turn, encouraged wider growth in the mainland economy, through higher wages and stronger consumer spending but also through ancillary services such as transport and finance. Several of these ancillary services, notably the supply and maintenance services, have become internationally competitive, despite the historically strong krone. Moreover, high taxation on developed oil wells has led to a resilient fiscal balance and vast sovereign wealth fund, the Government Pension Fund Global, which is used as a "nest egg" for future public spending, enabling additional public spending when fiscal stimulus is needed, as was the case after the 2014 slide in oil prices. The government has also withdrawn from the fund in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Despite the sector's influence on the wider economy, its impact on employment is limited, as just 1% of the labour force is involved in offshore activities. FDI outside oil and gas-related sector is through purchases of existing companies rather than establishing new companies or facilities. Slow progress on selling government stakes in a number of part-publicly owned companies may dampen FDI flows.
Potential Despite recent efforts by the government to induce more investment and private-sector activity by reducing the tax burden, the economy will still remain broadly unattractive to foreign investment owing to high labour costs. Although the population is highly educated and well trained, many of the non-oil, non-agricultural industries remain centred in Oslo, the capital. The government has made the wider development of the "High North" (the areas adjacent to the Arctic) a wider policy priority, offering various incentives and grants, including a reduction in the scale of employer contributions, with a focus on encouraging stronger growth in the maritime, healthcare and information technology sectors there. Nevertheless, the bulk of opportunities for foreign investment will remain in the energy sector, encompassing oil, gas and green energy (notably windpower).

The coronavirus crisis will raise downside risks to population growth The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the population to maintain its steady rate of growth over the forecast period (2020-24), although long-run factors, such as the ageing of the population and the trend towards smaller family sizes, will weigh on population growth in the coming years. Spurred by the solid expansion in the economy, high levels of migration from eastern Europe and the wealth effect of a steady rise in house prices, population growth has been consistently above 1% since 2007, averaging about 1.3% in 2008-14, according to Statistics Norway.
Since the start of 2013 the growth rate of the population has declined, from 1.3% to 0.9% in 2019, as the economic outlook has become more uncertain, reducing both births and immigration. Net immigration declined from its post-crisis peak of more than 48,700 in 2012 to 25,000 in 2018, reflecting the subsiding of the migrant crisis in 2016 and a tightening of migration rules for those outside the European Economic Area (EEA). The disruption caused by the coronavirus will probably dampen population growth significantly in the near term, as the outlook for the offshore and mainland economy weakens and the inflow of migrants slows.
Net migration has declined since 2012, despite a rise in asylum-seekers Net migration, which reached a peak of more than 47,000 in 2012, has been more subdued in recent years as migration from eastern Europe has subsided, to 25,000 in 2019. Inflows of migrants from Poland made up the largest incoming nationality in 2019, falling behind Syrian migrants for the first time since the 2015 migrant crisis. Polish migrants are the largest group within the migrant population, at a total of 101,000, according to official 2019 data.
This is followed by Lithuanians (40,600), Swedes (35,500) and Syrians (31,900). Strong migration inflows earlier in the decade will compensate for Norway's declining fertility rate, which peaked in 2009 at 1.98 (still below the replacement rate), and medical improvements should continue to raise life expectancy. Over the forecast period we expect the population to age gradually, with more than 18% of the population over the age of 67 by 2024, but buoyant inflows of migrant workers should also maintain steady growth in the working-age population at 0.5% from 2020-24, matching its average from 2015-19.
The demographic challenge is not as severe as in other European countries The ageing population will place a greater long-run strain on the public finances, with older citizens requiring more state support in the form of pensions, health and social care. These problems are less immediate than in other countries, as Norway has a more youthful population than other Scandinavian countries, with individuals 65 and over accounting for 27% of the working-age population in 2019, compared with 31% in Denmark. However, the ageing trend, and its repercussions, will remain the same, and we expect the dependency ratio to rise steadily, to 29% in 2024. For the fiscal balance, this will have a steadily corrosive impact.
Reform of the pension system to ensure its sustainability in the face of these pressures has been ongoing since 2001, and various measures, including flexible retirement ages (from 62 to 75), adjustments for life expectancy and less generous indexation have all been implemented to ensure the system is well funded. More measures are likely in the near future to disincentivise early retire-ment. Healthcare expenditure will also rise steadily, along with the median age, owing to both the greater healthcare needs of the older population, the greater need for stockpiling of medical equipment after the coronavirus outbreak and the price inflation of medical technology over the forecast period. Greater fiscal burdens will also be placed on local and municipal government, as the burden of social caring for the aged, in the form of live-in helpers or retirement homes, will also steadily mount as the age of the population rises.
Owing to Norway's unique geography, with a long coastline and separated settlements, rural areas are far more dispersed than in other European countries, raising the cost of services provision for isolated communities. This is aggravated by an increasingly concentrated population as a whole, with 81.9% of Norway's population living in urban areas. Areas in the far north of Norway are remote and underpopulated; Finnmark, the northernmost region, had a population of just 75,000 in 2014 and an area of 48,000 square kilometres. The cost of maintaining public service provision in rural areas was a central driver behind the "municipal reform" implemented by the Conservatives-led govern-ment in 2020.

High marginal taxes and tight labour markets ensure low wage inequality. Despite being one of the richest countries in the world (by GDP per head), Norway's limited population size, of just over 5m, and the country's high operating costs limit the scale of market opportunities available. When ranking countries by nominal GDP per head, Norway is third highest in the world, at US$75,472, ahead of the rest of the OECD excluding Luxembourg and Switz-erland. Measured at purchasing power parity (PPP), Norway performs less well, positioned sixth, with a GDP per head of US$69,213. This is owing to the country's higher price level and the correspondingly weaker purchasing power of the currency in Norway, reflecting higher costs for labour and transport. The econ-omy's overall size remains fairly small, with nominal GDP at just US$418bn, according to the IMF. This is larger than Finland (US$269bn), but slightly smaller than Austria (US$448bn) or Sweden (US$529bn), demonstrating Norway's limited size relative to other global markets. The OECD estimated the country's Gini coefficient to be at 0.262 in 2017, the fifth-lowest in the group of advanced economies (a Gini coefficient of zero represents perfect income equality and 1 displays total income inequality). This strong score reflects the low level of inequality in Norway, ensured by relatively high rates of marginal taxation and redistribution, alongside high levels of trust and co-operation within its society.
Investment has taken a larger role in growth since the financial crisis. Norway's consumer goods market is similar to those of other Scandinavian countries, albeit larger than Denmark's and smaller than Sweden's. Private consumption accounted for about 45% of overall GDP in 2019. Consumption growth accelerated in the late 1990s until 2007, averaging 4.1% year on year from 1996-2007 and contributing an average of 1.5 percentage points to annual economic growth over the period. Since the financial crisis, consumption growth has fallen, averaging 2.5% in 2010-18. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects this slowdown to continue over the 2020-24 forecast period, to an average of 2.3%, as investment recedes in its importance. The shock from the coronavirus crisis is likely to suspend further improvements in the near term. Unemployment will rise significantly in 2020, growth in nominal wages will decline, and price growth will subside. By 2024 we expect GDP per head to reach US$78,540 at market exchange rates and US$78,540 at PPP exchange rates.

The dominance of the oil sector prevents substantial diversification. As an advanced economy, Norway's consumers are well equipped with most consumer durables, including white goods, television sets, personal computers and home entertainment equipment. These markets are relatively open to competition, with many small, medium-sized and niche players competing. As the extent of domestic manufacturing remains limited, the bulk of consumer goods are imported. High labour costs are one of the few downsides to producing in Norway: at about EUR50 (US$56) per hour, the average hourly labour costs are among the highest in Scandinavia and the second highest in Europe after Switzerland (at EUR53 per hour) Geographically the country is connected to few of its major export markets (except Sweden) by land, preventing it from taking a role as a business or commercial hub for the rest of Europe. The dominance of the oil sector, on both skilled labour and the currency, also serves to constrain efforts to diversify the economy into other industries, as has been achieved in neighbouring Sweden and Denmark.
Norwegian consumer spending tends to be leisure-focused Norwegians tend to spend a higher proportion of their total income on food than most other European populations, although we expect this figure to fall during the forecast period. In part, this will reflect high tariffs and taxes on food products, as well as limited competition within the food retail sector. A higher proportion of spending is directed towards leisure, including hotel stays and restaurants. E-commerce has become incorperated into many firms' business structures, and 80% of Norwegian retailers have either a mobile app or a mobile-integrated website. We expect the extent of digital-service provision and online retail to increase substantially as a result of the coronavirus. Standards of living are generally high, with two out of ten households owning more than one car and a similar proportion owning a second (or holiday) home. Among the sociological trends that will have an impact on consumption patterns are a rise in single-person households and the gradual ageing of the population.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
The economy will not recover completely (in real terms) from the virus until 2023 Initial conditions: Aided by its rich endowment of offshore oil and gas, Norway's growth has outperformed that of its European neighbours over the past decade, with growth averaging 1.2% in 2008-19, compared with a euro area average of 0.8%. With only 48% of its petroleum reserves extracted to date, the country will retain its pre-eminence in European energy production throughout The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term forecast period, to 2050. However, pressures on the oil and gas sector are expected to mount over the short term as production is curtailed by disruption from the coronavirus crisis, and over the longer term as government policy becomes less accommodative, the oil price stays low and environmental concerns become more prominent in the national debate. Although participation rates in Norway are high, one long-term chall-enge for the government will be to reverse the trend among older workers to take early retirement. To this effect, the pensions system is undergoing more reform, including via a pension adjustment linked to life expec-tancy, which will be fully implemented by 2025. Technological change has also accelerated
Norway's growth in recent years, with the application of communication and information technology becoming more widespread since 2008 and supporting productivity growth. However, the economic fallout from the coronavirus will erode the features that have driven growth since 2009, including tight labour markets and solid trade growth. Further risk factors are a slowing pace of product market reforms and the overweening influence of the oil sector on the economy, limiting diversification and promoting exchange-rate volatility.
Demographic trends: Norway, like many other OECD countries, faces a steadily ageing population, driven by both a socioeconomic trend towards a lower birth rate and a preference for marrying later that have been evident since the 1960s. However, in the Norwegian case these trends have been slower to materialise, and immigration is higher than in the country's European neighbours, so Norway is in a more favourable position to face the challenges of an ageing population relative to other developed countries. Owing to strong inward migration from eastern Europe prior to the coronavirus crisis and a comparatively large share of young people in the population, Norway will maintain positive population growth throughout the forecast period (2020-24), although the rate of growth will fall from the 2020s onwards. The growth rate of the working-age population will also remain positive, but will ease from about 1% per year from 2000-18 to about 0.4% in 2020-50. Concurrently, the proportion of those aged 67 or above, and the old-age dependency ratio (those 67 and over relative to those aged 15-66) will increase, leading to greater fiscal pressure on the government, which provides old age services and transfers. Further rises in the participation rate (which is already among the highest in the world) or improvements to worker productivity will be needed to maintain the social safety net.
Even taking into account the flow of oil revenue, pension liabilities will greatly exceed the expected assets of the entire Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG, the sovereign wealth fund that was created to ensure that future gen-erations would benefit from the country's oil riches). There is concern that current pension reforms do not go far enough in tackling the problems related to work incentives and the generous scale of public-sector pensions. The government will need to take further action over the coming decade to avoid a sharply rising tax burden.
Disruption from coronavirus could undermine Norway's trading position External conditions: As a small country that is highly dependent on open markets and free trade, Norway stands to benefit from its European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, which extends the EU's single market to include it. The EU is the world's largest and most integrated regional market, and accounts for the vast majority of Norwegian exports and imports. Set against this, the EU's long-term rate of growth is likely to remain moderate. Another uncertainty over the forecast period concerns Norway's position with respect to the EU. Within the EU, although some progress will be made in advancing trade in goods and the liberalisation of trade in services, the focus-particularly in the next decade-will be on ensuring that there is no reversal of these policies. In this context the UK's withdrawal from the EU has the potential to be disruptive. Protectionist forces will increase in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, but as Norway is less well integrated into global supply chains, the fallout from this pressure will be less than in other countries. Although effort has gone into improving Norway-China economic relations, we expect collaboration to be confined to specific sectors, such as fish or oil exports, limiting effectiveness.
The sovereign wealth fund may not be adequate to guarantee pension costs Institutions and policy trends: Norway has a long democratic history and enjoys stable, democratic and transparent institutions, along with a well-entrenched justice system. Corruption is largely absent from Norwegian political and business life. The prospects for stable growth are enhanced by high levels of benefits and state-funded education, including at tertiary level, which ensures a healthy and well-educated workforce. In the long term, however, the welfare state may not be as well funded as it is currently. Norway favours free enterprise and market competition to a lesser extent than Denmark and Sweden. The state remains a significant player in many sectors, such as telecommunications, banking, energy and the offshore sector, and progress on the government's plan to reduce its stakes in some companies has been slow. Norway also lags neighbouring countries in efforts to promote competition in major product and labour markets, in part because the country's oil riches provide little incentive for policymakers to enact potentially unpopular structural reforms. Similarly, there is a risk that the existence of the GPFG will mask the need for reforms to the social security system. Ongoing pension reforms have incentives to work beyond retirement age and cut the link between pension payments and wages; these reform efforts are expected to continue in the coming years. However, government projections indicate that the assets of the pension fund will be insufficient to cover the state's liabilities arising from pensions and other demands on the public purse (such as healthcare) in the absence of further reform of both the pension system and the labour market. Measures would have to include further discouragement from taking early retirement or drawing disability benefits. (The proportion of the workforce drawing disability benefit in Norway is almost double the average for the OECD.) Ensuring the sustainability of Norway's generous welfare state will be an important challenge for future governments.
Strong investment and productivity growth will raise long term output Long-term performance: As Norway has less scope than most other developed economies to raise its labour force participation rate, its long-term economic prospects will depend on a continued high rate of investment, as well as improvements in productivity, which we expect to rise during the forecast period (to an average of 0.3% in 2020-50), having been sluggish for much of the past decade (at an average of 0.2% in 2011-20). Long-term economic performance will also depend on how successive governments meet the challenge of structural reform. Given the current large surpluses on the general government budget, it is often easy for policymakers to ignore non-oil budget deficits. A failure to adapt social security and welfare systems to the challenge of population ageing would lead to large fiscal deficits towards the end of the long-term forecast period, which would necessitate a rising tax burden and dampen growth. This would be exacerbated should oil production decrease markedly, making continued investment in exploration important.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability The majority of Norway's emissions come from the exploitation of the country's oil and gas reserves, with aluminium production also contributing. Domestic energy usage, which is largely met through abundant hydro-electric infrastructure, is not an important contributor to Norway's carbon emissions, unlike in other advanced economies. The Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG, the sovereign wealth fund) has become more strident in its support of environmental concerns over the past few years. In 2016 two new criteria were established by the fund, making it move away from, firstly, companies with unacceptable greenhouse-gas emissions and, secondly, companies for which at least 30% of revenue is derived from thermal coal, or operations based on thermal coal. In March 2019 the government established a further criterion forcing the fund to divest from upstream firms specialising in oil and gas exploration, although its holdings of generalised energy firms, including all major publicly traded oil producers, have remained.
Norway will be relatively sheltered from the impact of climate change. With a small agricultural sector and a mostly urban population, the country is easily protected from the warming planet. With the majority of economic output concentrated in the area around Oslo, the capital, and the coastal cities of Bergan, Stavanger and Trondheim, the protection of urban areas against rising sea levels and weather events will be central to Norway's strategy to mitigate the economic effects of climate change. The opening up of new areas for oil exploration in the Arctic Circle (as ice cover falls) will be an upside risk to Norwegian growth and should mitigate some costs to output.
Despite efforts by successive governments to bolster environmental policy, a substantial effort to reduce oil-related activities is unlikely, with further reform only likely to limit the sector's growth, rather than reverse it. Aided by the economic need for further diversification, political pressure is mounting from smaller parties, like the Liberals and the Christian Democrats (both of which are in government) and an environmental element within the Labour Party to curtail the oil sector's development. This division within parliament is likely to be reflected in a gradual erosion of the country's generous tax incentives for oil exploration over the long term. According to The Economist Intelligence Unit's climate change model, Norway's GDP will be only about 0.8% smaller by 2050 than it would have been in a world without climate change.
Migration and urbanisation Norway has largely adopted an accommodative policy towards migration since the late 1970s and the migrant population (including those of Norwegian birth, but with two parents born abroad) in 2017 was about 888,700, making up 16.8% of the country's total population. Immigration to Norway has risen steadily over the decades-in 1992 migrants totalled about 183,000 people (4.3% of Norway's population) and net migration was relatively small (9,100). Net migration steadily rose thereafter, peaking in 2012 as 48,700 people entered the country, before dropping to 27,800 in 2016. The bulk of these migrants came from eastern Europe after the region's transition into the EU in 2004, but there remains a significant portion of German and Swedish migrants in Norway (totalling about 60,900 in 2016). Recent migration has come from non-European countries such as Syria, Somalia and Eritrea. These migrants have proved more politically contentious, as greater differences in cultural background and socioeconomic status have led to concerns about integration-the far-right Progress Party (FrP) has now included the reduction of non-European migration as part of its policy agenda. Although the FrP supports the centre-right coalition government, we expect Norway's collaborative political system to result in moderate government policy and the country to maintain an accommodative stance on immigration and integration.
Norway's population has become more urbanised as the economy has developed. According to the World Bank, urbanisation rates surpassed 50% in 1960, rising rapidly over the next 20 years to 70.5% in 1980. Since then the pace of urban growth has been more subdued, with the rate only surpassing 80% in 2013, reaching 82% 2018. Norway remains the most rural of the Scandinavian economies, with urbanisation rates in Sweden and Denmark slightly higher, at 87% and 88% respectively. This is in part owing to Norway's large land area and long sea coast, making rural communities more isolated, but also because Norway was historically rural and underdeveloped compared with its Scandinavian peers, and so has further to catch up with its neighbours. The difficulties of paying for high standards of public service provision to an ageing and diminishing population in rural areas are putting pressure on the government to reduce costs. This was the motivation behind the "municipal reform" circulated in 2014 which will aggregate the municipal and county authorities together to encourage greater economies of scale and information-sharing in local government services.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2015-19) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2020-24). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2015-19. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2020-24 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2015-19 ranges are then used to derive 2020-24 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2020-24, not to the likely situation in 2024 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2017 or 2022). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - Despite Venezuela's socioeconomic collapse and the public health crisis triggered by the spread of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19), The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, will retain power throughout the 2020-24 forecast period. Mr Maduro's position will be supported primarily by his grip over a complex security apparatus and the opposition's lack of de facto power. On this basis, we expect continued deterioration of the economy, sustained outward migration, and a poorer and more violent Venezuela. Despite US sanctions (and their impact on oil production), the Maduro regime has managed internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through its strict control over the security forces.
- The scale of the socioeconomic collapse and the elevated level of political instability will ensure that the Maduro regime continues to be challenged economically and politically. Low international crude prices, combined with US sanctions on the regime, mean that Venezuela is struggling to place its oil exports abroad. We therefore project a reduction in domestic crude production over the coming months. Moreover, given that it will lose control of the legislature in 2021, the opposition will be under strong pressure in 2020 to step up its efforts to oust the regime. Mr Maduro will continue to face challenges to maintain the current patronage system and remain in control.
- De facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding. Concurrently, the government has taken measures that have allowed the official exchange rate to float. These measures have so far aided price stability and therefore increase the availability of some basic goods. However, the measures are not a product of economic orthodoxy, but of policy decisions to ensure the regime's survival. We do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that will be required to resolve the economic crisis within the forecast period.

- Venezuela is ranked 82nd of 82 countries in the global business environment rankings for 2020-24, having been 80th in the 2015-19 historical period, as the economic crisis deepens despite minor improvements. Reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment are unlikely.

Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: Expansion of interventionist measures, including price controls. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and continue to undermine free competition.
2022-24: Contract rights remain weak, and red tape and ad hoc interventionism continue.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Most attempts to attract investment prove unsuccessful, owing to political and economic instability.
2022-24: Actual investment flows remain low amid ongoing economic volatility. Intellectual property protection and private property rights deteriorate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: Currency controls are weakened, but access to foreign currency remains limited.
2022-24: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, and de facto dollarisation advances. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves as oil prices rise, albeit slowly.
Taxes 2020-21: Risk of further unrest and political instability reduces probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major rise in public spending.
2022-24: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2020-21: Inflation remains high, and concerns surrounding economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2022-24: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2020-21: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Past emigration of skilled labour aggravates skills shortages.
2022-24: Labour-market rigidities persist, despite some increase in flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2020-21: Underinvestment in water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts.
2022-24: Investors remain highly cautious of committing to long-term capital projects. Infrastructure deteriorates even further.
Technological readiness 2020-21: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment, but with little interest.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013 proved unsuccessful. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his own popularity plummet as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices, combined with strict sanctions on trade from the US, has plunged the country into a severe economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly (AN). In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature to be in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017, a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the AN.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports, and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$20.9bn in 2018 as the destruction of domestic supply led to increasing import dependence. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates the 2018 current-account surplus to be 3.6% of GDP.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit considers that the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) and diminished oil rents-resulting from low international oil prices and existing US sanctions-present the greatest challenges to date to the survival of the military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV). Hyperinflation and bolívar depreciation are worsening, with goods shortages already making a comeback. In addition, owing to the bleak state of its healthcare system, Venezuela faces an uphill battle against the coronavirus, and there is a high risk that the ongoing socioeconomic crisis will evolve into a humanitarian calamity. Mr Maduro is wary of the potential political ramifications of fuel scarcity in Venezuela, given that these may lead to severe shortages of goods and public services over the coming months. Coupled with the government's mandatory social distancing measures (which will curb incomes further), significant bouts of social unrest are likely. Mr Maduro's recent decision to lift some petrol subsidies will cause further ill will.
Despite these compounding social and economic shocks, we expect Mr Maduro to retain power throughout 2020, ruling over what is becoming a much less populous and much poorer country. Mr Maduro has two main factors in his favour. First, the opposition, led by the head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, has lost the momentum that it held in 2019. Although Mr Guaidó enjoys widespread international recognition as the legitimate leader of Venezuela, the current public health crisis is demonstrating once again that his interim government has no de facto power. Second, the regime retains strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces. Although the risks to our forecasts are very high, we assume that this control-together with the complexity of the security apparatus and the recurrent purges within it-will allow the regime to manage internal dissent.
Although it is not part of our baseline forecast, we recognise that there is an extremely high risk of some sort of political transition. There are three main paths to this: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We assess the prospect of military action, by the US or Colombia, as low and consider that a negotiated transition would also be difficult. In early March the US outlined a transition framework in which both Mr Maduro and Mr Guaidó would allow a new state council to be created and fresh elections to be held. However, this proposal (like other negotiated solutions) is likely to fail, as trust issues between the sides are insurmountable. In March the US indicted 14 top chavista officials, including Mr Maduro, discouraging the regime from co-operating on a negotiated exit. Nevertheless, successful talks with Colombia regarding humanitarian and/or health assistance are possible.
We believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The regime's main weakness is the fragility of its internal finances. Its patronage system is crucial for sustaining its security apparatus and resisting social unrest. Low international crude prices, US sanctions and the dampening effect of a global recession on workers' remittances will shrink dollar inflows further. The regime will continue to benefit from funds from drug trafficking and illegal mining activities, but a lack of hard currency could prove fatal to the patronage system and will test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks. The regime's liquidity problems and a rapidly worsening socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis could prompt putsch attempts in the near term.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch Legislative elections will take place in December, assuming that Mr Maduro clings to power and that the regime does not cancel the polls (Mr Maduro has hinted that they could be suspended owing to the coronavirus pandemic). These elections would be neither free nor fair, and the opposition would lose control of the National Assembly. If the opposition were to secure some sort of political change in 2020, the interim government would pursue deep-seated reforms to the electoral authority and attempt to hold a vote within 12 months of its formation, although achieving this would be a major challenge.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations Mr Guaidó has marshalled strong support from the international community, but efforts by most governments in Latin America to support him have reached an impasse. Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, the US, has instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions-most recently placing severe restrictions on the Venezuelan operations of Chevron, a US oil company-and has openly called for the Venezuelan military to accept Mr Guaidó in place of Mr Maduro. The US expects sanctions to put enough pressure on the regime's finances (and therefore on its patronage system) to force Mr Maduro to hold free and fair elections. The US also warned of additional sanctions in the near future. The US administration will remain hawkish in its approach to foreign policy, but we believe that a military intervention is unlikely, given the aversion of the US president, Donald Trump, to such adventurism. If tensions rise and political violence increases, the possibility of smaller-scale interventions cannot be discounted.
Mr Maduro's main international backers are Cuba, Russia, China and-more recently-Iran. Russia is helping Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA, the Venezuelan state-owned oil company) to circumvent US sanctions; in March the Venezuelan assets of Rosneft (a Russian energy company) were transferred directly to Russia, representing a step-up in the US-Russia diplomatic crossfire over Venezuela. Nevertheless, both Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the financing-amounting to tens of billions of US dollars per year-required to stabilise the economy and secure PDVSA's long-term future. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries, but seems to have had little success in securing finance for investment. If a transition from the Maduro regime were to come about, we believe that Russia and China would be willing to work with Mr Maduro's successor to protect their current investments. Iran recently sent 1.5m barrels of petrol to Venezuela in exchange for gold shipments and is helping to fix the Paraguaná oil refinery.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends The Maduro regime will focus on weathering the fuel shortages and containing the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Despite community spread and an accelerating number of Covid-19 cases, Mr Maduro has eased nationwide quarantine measures to some degree. From June the regime will implement a "5+10" system, whereby five days of more flexible social distancing measures will be followed by ten of tighter restrictions. Reflecting a lack of confidence in the government's ability to support incomes, quarantine restrictions have barely been followed; many workers lack the savings they need to survive without continuing to work. Furthermore, the country's medical infrastructure is poor and hospitals face significant shortages of water, soap, medicines and electricity. Venezuela's health system is simply unprepared to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. The regime's overall lack of policy-making capacity will lead to accelerating hyperinflation, sharper bolívar depreciation and an even steeper recession in 2020.
Moreover, given the risk that fuel shortages pose to the regime, Mr Maduro has taken some steps to alleviate fuel scarcity. On May 31st the regime announced a two-tiered petrol distribution system. Drivers will be subject to a monthly quota of subsidised petrol. When this has been reached, petrol will be available at internationally indexed prices. The regime will also designate 200 fuel stations across Venezuela, which will be operated by independent or private companies, with petrol in these stations costing a fixed US$0.5 per litre. These measures seek to regularise black-market activity so that the regime (rather than a third party) benefits from the gains. Nonetheless, this will only partly work, as arbitrage opportunities are still possible under the new subsidy system.
Based on our view that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout our 2020-24 forecast period, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that are required to resolve the economic crisis. De facto dollarisation is expanding; although this was not a tacit goal for the regime, Mr Maduro now welcomes it. Other under-the-radar adjustments are possible in the coming years, as long as these benefit the regime's survival. Such efforts alone are unlikely to bring about economic stability, owing to the absence of a comprehensive microeconomic reform or improvements in rule of law, and policy predictability will not be forthcoming under the current regime.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy The authorities have not published complete data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect the non-financial public-sector deficit to narrow in 2020, and the public debt/GDP ratio to remain high in the coming years. The sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will curb government spending. The regime relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Money printing will continue to finance the government's deficits in 2020-24. However, over the medium term, growing remittance inflows will partly offset the need to monetise budget deficits. We currently assume no debt restructuring during the forecast period. Venezuela's weak fiscal position is complicated by the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing-mainly PDVSA-issued debt and development funds from China-that understates the true size of total public liabilities.
All of the sovereign's outstanding global bonds are in arrears. However, bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy shifts or a change in government. The key PDVSA 2020 bond, which was secured using 50.1% of the shares of Citgo (PDVSA's US subsidiary) as collateral, fell due at end-October 2019 and was not paid. A US court ruled that PDVSA is an "alter ego" of the Venezuelan government; this will have far-reaching implications, as some international firms are seeking to seize shares of Citgo stock. However, the US considers Citgo to be under Mr Guaidó's purview, thus currently shielding Citgo assets from seizure by creditors.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy The government's financing needs will force the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) to ramp up money printing in the short term. Growing dollarisation and a strong contraction in domestic demand slowed hyper-inflationary pressures in 2019. However, we expect hyperinflation to return in the coming months, owing to monetisation of large fiscal deficits and severe goods shortages. Overall, hyperinflation will continue until its underlying causes are addressed. Hyperinflation has quickened the pace of dollarisation of the economy (more than 50% of transactions are now thought to be conducted in US dollars). We believe that Venezuela is heading towards overall de facto dollarisation. Monthly inflation will rise again in the short term and remain substantial. However, given the effect of dollarisation on price stability, we do not expect a return to the extremely high rates of annual inflation of over 1,000,000% experienced in 2018.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 36.2% in 2019 (and cumulative contraction of almost 70% since 2013), we expect an additional decline, of 25.4%, in 2020. The contraction reflects falling oil exports and the adverse effects of the government's quarantine measures, which will further dent domestic demand. Fuel shortages will also hit the non-oil economy indirectly, through scarcity of inputs and reinvigorated hyperinflation. From a demand-side perspective, the GDP contraction will be driven by falling real incomes and continued mass emigration (which is fuelled by unemployment, violence and social instability).
Low crude prices and weak oil exports will put significant pressure on the country to slash crude production. Venezuela's average break-even price is about US$15-US$20 per barrel. US sanctions on the regime raise the risks involved in dealing with Venezuela, forcing the country to offer a hefty discount on its crude. This means that, at current market prices, Venezuela is selling its oil at a loss (its oil basket reached US$10/barrel in mid-May). The current circumstances will inevitably lead to cuts in production; we expect oil output to decline from 630,000 barrels/day (b/d) in April-according to the International Energy Agency (IEA)-to 620,000 b/d on average in 2020. However, we believe that average output could fall as low as 500,000 b/d over the coming months.
In 2021 we expect the economy to grow marginally, owing to a stabilisation of oil output, base effects and the lifting of social distancing measures. In 2022 economic growth will accelerate on the back of a surge in oil prices. However, in the medium term, oil output will continue to fall-albeit gradually-owing to serious operational problems (such as difficulties in obtaining equipment for repairs or finding qualified staff) and to a limited pool of suitable buyers of Venezuelan crude. Export volumes will start to recover marginally in 2022-24 (owing to moderately higher global oil prices), as producers become more accustomed to the new post-sanctions export markets. Furthermore, relative macroeconomic stability will allow the non-oil economy to recover marginally in the medium term. There are substantial risks to our forecasts, which assume that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout the forecast period. In the event of a transition, there would be upside risks to our medium-term baseline; the degree of improvement would depend on the characteristics of the transition and on the new government's macroeconomic programme.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation Severely reduced domestic supply, constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits will lead to a return to hyperinflation this year. Dollarisation and the regime's heavy restrictions on credit helped to subdue hyperinflation in the second half of 2019. However, inflationary pressures will intensify substantially in the coming months, owing to wide-spread goods shortages, the reintroduction of price controls on a number of goods and the ramping-up of government money printing. Indeed, consumer prices rose by 80% month on month in April. In the medium term, inflation will remain high for as long as the Maduro regime is in power, given huge fundamental imbalances between supply and demand, and the need for the regime to monetise its fiscal deficits. Weather-related shocks are a perennial risk to the inflation outlook.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates Accelerating hyperinflation will quicken the pace of bolívar depreciation in 2020. Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency denomination (as in March 2018) or a new currency is a strong possibility, although the exact nature of such a move is hard to forecast. In mid-2019 the regime announced a loosening of currency controls. Although this was a positive move, significant barriers limit access to US dollars via formal means. We still believe that the government will maintain a number of indirect controls on the foreign-exchange market. In this context, a black-market exchange-rate premium is inevitable. On May 26th the official exchange rate was BsS193,200:US$1, compared with a black-market rate of BsS196,700:US$1. The premium (currently 1.8%) is small by historical comparison.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector Venezuela will post a small current-account deficit of 2.2% of GDP in 2020, owing to lower oil exports and limited remittance inflows resulting from the global recession. The BCV's official figures for 2017-18 show that Venezuela posted current-account surpluses in this period. In 2019 the collapse of goods export earnings (owing to US sanctions on the oil trade) hit the trade balance hard. Nevertheless, based on the latest data, we estimate that the current account remained in surplus as a result of growing inflows of workers' remittances and the non-payment of interest on bonded debt (saving in excess of US$5bn in 2019). We expect the current account to return to surplus in the medium term, averaging 5.3% of GDP in 2022-24. Goods exports will recover as international oil prices increase and the country steps up trade with Asian markets. This recovery will be supported by continued weakness in domestic demand, rising remittances from abroad and the fact that the sovereign will remain in default throughout the forecast period.

Full text: - The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the current government to serve out its second term, which will expire in 2024. We expect the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to run a highly centralised administration, and make some progress on pushing through structural reforms.
- We expect the government to extend the nationwide lockdown introduced as a result of the coronavirus pandemic in late March until July. Nevertheless, restrictions under the lockdown have been partially relaxed since mid-May. The Economist Intelligence Unit's view is that the daily confirmed cases of the virus will peak in early July.
- India's relations with the US will remain warm in 2020-24. However, disagreements on tariff and service-sector export restrictions will limit trade deals. Relations with China will remain strained, owing to border disputes and concerns about that country's ambitions in South Asia. Bilateral relations with Pakistan will also remain strained, but we do not expect outright hostilities.
- The budget deficit will widen to 7.4% of GDP in 2020/21 (April-March), as the government falls short on revenue income and launches stimulus to keep households and firms afloat during the lockdown. It will narrow but nevertheless remain wide during the remainder of the forecast period.
- We expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) to cut interest rates by another 100 basis points in the remainder of 2020. The RBI will also tweak its policy tools and regulatory framework to facilitate the transmission of accommodative monetary policy.
- Real GDP will contract by 5.8% in 2020/21. While, the recovery in 2021/22 will be sluggish on a sequential basis, we expect the economy to grow by 9.4%, primarily owing to a low base of comparison.
- The rupee is forecast to depreciate against the US dollar in 2020, averaging Rs74.8:US$1 as global investors flee to safe-haven markets. It will strengthen slightly in 2021, before depreciating again for the rest of the forecast period
- The trade deficit will narrow in 2020 amid a slump in global oil prices. It will widen from 2021 as India increases imports of capital goods. Business outsourcing and information technology will remain the key service export sectors in 2020-24.

- India's score improves over the forecast period, owing to improvements in the infrastructure category, but its overall regional ranking remains weak.

Country forecast overview: India's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: The government takes steps towards partial privatisation of some state-owned companies in 2021.
2022-24: The government continues to rationalise liquidation and bankruptcy laws to simplify the closure of loss-making businesses or merger and acquisition activity involving other corporate entities.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: The government liberalises foreign direct investment (FDI) policy in several sectors, as it also encourages the use of locally made products.
2022-24: Foreign investment in export manufacturing increases markedly, albeit in only a few regions.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: The country remains reluctant to join major regional trade deals.
2022-24: Full capital-account convertibility remains off the policy agenda.
Taxes 2020-21: The government provides only marginal tax rebates and breaks to businesses and individuals affected by the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak.
2022-24: Alcohol and petroleum products remain outside the scope of the goods and services tax (GST).
Financing 2020-21: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) relaxes regulatory norms for debt-laden banks and non-bank financial companies (NBFC), raising risks to incentivise lending to support economic growth.
2022-24: Private-sector banks account for a rising share of total lending, while bad debt issues persist in public-sector banks. Major consolidation and privatisations within the public-sector banks will continue.
The labour market 2020-21: Unemployment soars because of the lockdown; the government expands the national employment guarantee scheme. Labour laws are liberalised temporarily in some provinces through state-level ordinances.
2022-24: State-level liberalisation of labour laws is made permanent through legislation by the central government.
Infrastructure 2020-21: The government increases its budgetary allocation of infrastructural spending to support the economy through the coronavirus crisis.
2022-24: The construction of a high-speed rail link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad continues, but the project misses its targeted completion date of August 2022.
Technological readiness 2020-21: Most technological innovation continues to be concentrated in a few clusters, such as Bangalore and Hyderabad. Expenditure on research and development (R&D) as a proportion of GDP remains low by international standards.
2022-24: The government makes efforts to digitise the delivery of public services, in an effort to cut corruption and promote the efficiency of "last-mile delivery" for such services.

Background: India gained independence in 1947 after two centuries of British colonial rule. Partition at the same time created the state of Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars (two of them over the disputed territory of Kashmir). India is the second-most populous country in the world, with an estimated 1.37bn people in 2019, according to the UN. Its economy was the third-largest in the world in 2019 when measured in nominal US dollars at purchasing power parity exchange rates.
Political structure: India has been a democracy since independence. At federal level, the Bharatiya Janata Party holds a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), although it governs in a broader coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). India follows the UK model of parliamentary government, with a prime minister as head of government. It has a president as the head of state. The country has a quasi-federal structure, with state governments having their own legislatures and enjoying a fair degree of freedom.
Policy issues: We expect the ruling BJP to undertake policy reforms once the coronavirus pandemic passes. The government has already announced measures to privatise or merge public-sector units in many industries to promote competition within private companies. The government will also make modest progress on liberalising regulatory requirements and foreign investment. However, the primary focus of the government will be on structural reform, particularly the contentious labour and land laws. We expect progress to be made on these issues, even in the face of opposition. The current administration has made headway in speeding up infrastructure projects, and this, too. will remain a priority in the next five years.
Taxation: The government will maintain efforts to broaden the tax base in 2020-24, including by further digitising tax departments. This, coupled with strong economic growth, will support a pick-up in tax collection. Despite some reforms, including the introduction of a nationwide goods and services tax in 2017, India's tax system will remain highly complex.
Foreign trade: India's merchandise trade deficit narrowed to US$154.1bn in 2019, from US$186.7bn in 2018, while its surplus on the services account rose from US$80.8bn to US$83.7bn in the same period.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the majority of seats in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) elections that took place in April-May 2019. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the central government to remain in power for its full term, which ends in 2024. The results of the 2019 election were a testament to the popularity of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, who will remain the dominant figure in the government. Decision-making will remain centralised among the prime minister's office (PMO) and key ministers.
In late March the government began to implement what have been among the most stringent lockdown measures around the world, designed to stem the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19). These measures were initially welcomed by the public as an effective method of halting the spread of the virus. However, we expect the extensive economic damage caused by these restrictions to lead to increased social unrest. High levels of unemployment and the government's inability to provide income support will challenge the administration. We expect the government's reform agenda, especially with regard to liberalising labour laws, to be another source of social unrest. Nevertheless, we do not expect these developments to unseat the government; this is owing to its formidable support from a large part of the citizenry and the lack of a strong opposition.
Over the medium term, protests by religious groups and communal clashes will pose a threat to political stability. Large-scale protests tied to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) were only cut short by social distancing measures put in place to slow the spread of the virus. In contrast to the country's current secular constitution, several far-right groups, including some affiliated with the BJP, have long been pushing for India to be recast as a Hindu nation-a view that puts them at odds with minority groups in the country, notably Muslims. The risk of social instability is high in the latter part of the forecast period, particularly in the two-year period prior to the 2024 general elections, provided the ruling party moves ahead with its Hindutva agenda.
The security situation in the state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) will also remain a key concern throughout the forecast period. The government's decision in August 2019 to revoke the special status accorded to the state sparked protests. Despite the deployment of large numbers of troops and the arrest of many local leaders, further unrest cannot be ruled out. We expect security risks in the area to remain high in the medium term. Any attempt by protesters to destabilise the region is likely to face a heavy-handed response from the government, including the use of internet shutdowns, curfews and riot-control forces. The government's move has also increased the risk of related terrorist attacks by separatist forces in major Indian cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch The next general election is expected to be held around May 2024. The focus before then will be the state assembly elections. The results of recent state elections suggest that voters treat state and national elections differently, and that local issues tend to be more important in the former. We expect the BJP coalition to gain power in the upcoming Bihar election to be held in late 2020, but only with the help of its coalition partner in the state.
In the Rajya Sabha (the upper house), the BJP and its allies form the largest grouping, although they command fewer than half the total number of seats. Assuming that the BJP retains control of key state assemblies and wins control of more in the next few years, the party and its allies within the larger National Democratic Alliance (NDA) could secure a simple majority in the upper house. This will enable the alliance to pass legislation without opposition approval. However, it will struggle to win the two-thirds majority needed to make constitutional changes unchallenged.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations Tensions with Pakistan have been exacerbated by the Indian government's move in August 2019 to revoke the special status granted to J&K. We expect relations to remain strained, but do not anticipate a complete breakdown of diplomatic ties. We believe that Pakistan's military will increase its support for militant groups in Indian-controlled Kashmir. This will raise the risk of terrorist attacks by non-state actors. Although small-scale military exchanges between the two countries are likely to occur in 2020-24, the nuclear arsenal of the two countries will act as a powerful deterrent against full-scale conflict.
China is India's primary geopolitical rival in the region, and economic and political relations between the two countries will remain testy. India will continue to take steps to shield the domestic market from Chinese influence, such as a recent change requiring government approval for Chinese investments. Skirmishes will also continue over the infrastructural developments in border regions disputed by the two countries, but these will not turn into large-scale clashes.
We expect India to make progress in improving ties with the US, Japan and Australia, among other countries, to counter China's growing influence. India's foreign policy within South Asia will also focus on countering increasing Chinese influence in Nepal and Sri Lanka with increased diplomatic engagement and economic support. India's relations with Bangladesh will remain more cordial.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends The BJP government will enjoy considerable flexibility in determining the economic policy agenda, given its majority in the Lok Sabha. The key near-term priority for the administration is to contain the development of the coronavirus outbreak, to which India is particularly vulnerable, given its large population and weak healthcare infrastructure. While the government applied widespread and stringent lockdown measures, it has not succeeded in driving down the infection rate. Furthermore, as the economic costs of these measures became clear, the government relaxed measures by mid-May. While we expect the lockdown to be extended further into June, the current relaxations will, however, continue.
We expect the government to take up policy reforms after the crisis as it looks to support growth. The government has announced plans to open up many sectors of the economy to private firms, by privatising or reducing the number of public-sector units. The government will undertake piecemeal changes to legislation, such as relaxation of regulatory requirements and a modest liberalisation of foreign direct investment (FDI) rules. However, we expect the primary policy focus of the government to be improving the business environment by liberalising contentious labour and land laws. These reforms will take years to materialise and the benefits will only be seen in the latter part of the forecast period. The lockdown will amplify the mounting non-performing loan (NPL) issue in the banking sector. Slow progress will be made towards policy changes to improve the health of the banking sector. Infrastructure projects-particularly pet projects of the Modi government, such as the National Infrastructure Pipeline-remain a priority, in response to the rapid pace of urbanisation and partly to boost the business environment. But we expect a revival in infrastructural spending only from the fourth quarter of 2020, once the coronavirus outbreak is brought under control.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy The coronavirus outbreak will force the government to rewrite its approved budget for 2020/21, which was conservatively expansionary. It is likely to suspend temporarily the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act to allow for more flexibility in terms of supporting the economy. The extension of the lockdown has prompted an unbudgeted increase in social spending programmes, especially the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, as well as an extension of existing financial support schemes for businesses.
The government had announced an Rs20trn package (equivalent to around 10% of GDP) to support the economy. However, this headline figure includes liquidity measures provided by the central bank and advances by banks under the government's measures. The actual amount of additional budgetary spending announced is worth around 1.4% of GDP. We expect the government to announce another fiscal package, worth 1-1.5% of GDP, in the third quarter of 2020, which will include an infrastructure development programme. Combined with a fall in revenue and lower nominal GDP, the budget deficit is forecast to widen to the equivalent of 7.4% of GDP in 2020/21.
As the economy recovers, the government will look gradually to consolidate the public finances. This will lead to a narrowing of the budget deficit to the equivalent of 6.5% of GDP in 2021/22. The authorities will look to deepen the tax base and increase low levels of tax compliance. However, the need to support welfare payments and infrastructure spending will keep upward pressure on fiscal expenditure. We also expect subsidies for labour-intensive, small-scale businesses, particularly those that are export-focused, in an effort to promote exports and employment.
This federal fiscal picture does not reflect the true level of the deficit. The deficits of many states and part of the expenditure by public-sector units represent implicit liabilities for the central government.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy The coronavirus epidemic will prompt further monetary-policy loosening by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank). The central bank has lowered its policy repo rate by 115 basis points to 4% since March, as well as widening the monetary-policy corridor by lowering the reverse repo rate (the "floor" of the corridor) by 155 basis points, to 3.35%. With inflationary pressures expected to moderate and economic growth under strong downward pressure, we expect a further 100-basis-point reduction in the policy repo rate over the remainder of 2020. We also expect the adoption of more unconventional policy instruments, which will include further long-term refinancing operations.
Monetary policy will aim to support businesses as the coronavirus pandemic supresses household spending and business investment. However, the outcome may be far from satisfactory, as monetary policy transmission is not smooth. While banking-sector lending to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) will improve as the government has provided a sovereign guarantee to those loans, banks will be reluctant to lend to other parts of the economy, given increased risk. The level of non-performing assets in the financial sector is alarming, and the coronavirus outbreak will only exacerbate the issue, with more firms forced out of business. Policy support by the central bank and the government will be needed to support the recovery of the banking sector once the pandemic passes. The RBI has maintained inflation-targeting as the cornerstone of its monetary policy framework. It seeks to contain consumer price inflation within a 2-6% range, and close to a target of 4%. However, strong political pressure on the RBI-which has forced out two hawkish heads of the bank under BJP rule-has complicated the achievement of these objectives.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth We expect real GDP in 2020/21 to contract by 5.8%, registering the sharpest contraction in economic activity since independence in 1947. The headline GDP number will primarily be pulled down by a 20% year-on-year economic contraction in the first quarter of 2020/21, reflecting India's stringent lockdown measures. Economic activity will continue to contract year on year in the second quarter of 2020/21, as job losses and closures of businesses depress economic activity. Many sectors, particularly travel, hospitality and tourism, will continue to contract sharply in the second quarter, with coronavirus cases unlikely to peak until July. Economic conditions will improve through the remainder of the year. Nevertheless, labour shortages and depressed consumer and business sentiment will mean that the economy will still register only modest year-on-year growth in the third and fourth quarters.
On a GDP expenditure basis, we expect private consumption to contract sharply in 2020/21, as people are unable to consume as much during the lockdown and as consumption remains low, even after the lockdown is lifted. Investment spending is also expected to decline steeply as firms postpone investment activity amid high uncertainty around the virus. We also expect increased loan liabilities to be taken up by corporates and banks to further discourage new investment. We maintain our view that the government will continue to bolster the economy through increased expenditure, but the effect will be limited. We expect exports to fall as global recession sets in.
Real GDP growth is expected to rebound sharply in 2o21/22, but the headline forecast of 9.4% is exaggerated by an extremely low base of comparison in 2020/21. Economic growth in 2022/23-2024/25 will average 5.8% a year. Structural reforms, which we expect to be passed by the current administration, will provide support to growth in the latter part of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation We expect consumer prices to increase by an average of 3.4% in 2020 as a whole. While food price inflation has remained elevated during the lockdown, we expect it to moderate once supply-side constraints ease. Furthermore, a collapse in non-food demand will lead the fall in the headline number. Inflation will be further pushed down in the second half of the year, owing to a higher base of comparison in 2019. Our forecast assumes a normal monsoon this year (and in every year of the outlook period).
The RBI will keep its policy rate unchanged in 2021 to bolster the recovery. The adoption of a tighter monetary policy stance by the RBI in 2022 will offset the inflationary impact of strengthening oil prices. The central bank will accord higher priority to containing inflationary pressures towards the end of the forecast period; consumer price inflation is expected to reach 4.4% in 2024.
Low oil prices and low domestic demand in 2020 will cause producer price inflation to decline by 0.2% in the year. As prices for oil and other commodities strengthen, producer price inflation will firm to an average of 3.7% in 2021-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates The RBI's adoption of a fairly aggressive loosening stance in 2020, along with a sharp contraction in economic activity, will weigh on the exchange rate. We forecast that the rupee will depreciate by 6.3% on an annual average basis, to Rs74.8:US$1 in 2020, as investors flee to safe-haven markets and the domestic economic situation worsens. In 2021 we expect the rupee to appreciate to an average of Rs73.2:US$1, as foreign investment returns. The rupee will depreciate in 2022-24 amid rising oil prices and persistent current-account deficit.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector The lower oil price and weaker domestic demand will contribute to a narrowing of India's current-account deficit in 2020, to the equivalent of 0.4% of GDP. Merchandise exports will contract owing to disruption caused by the pandemic, but are expected to rebound in 2021 amid a pick-up in global commerce. Increased competition from other countries and changing industrial trends will weigh on the pace of growth in India's main service export sectors, particularly business-process outsourcing and information technology (IT). Nevertheless, the services balance will remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, making a positive contribution to the current account. Owing to the large shortfall on merchandise trade, however, the current account will remain in deficit in the remainder of the forecast period.
The coronavirus outbreak will also weigh on inward investment in 2020-21. Inward direct investment will recover in 2021-24, as the expanding economy and growing consumer demand provide opportunities for businesses.

Full text: - Venezuela is engulfed in a severe socioeconomic crisis, which will deepen amid the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak. Political volatility is high and risks to The Economist Intelligence Unit's political outlook are substantial. For now, we maintain our assumption that the regime led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) will retain power throughout 2020. The opposition led by Juan Guaidó, the leader of the National Assembly, has lost its momentum, while international pressure has reached an impasse. Moreover, Mr Maduro has managed to exert a strict control over the country's complex security apparatus, which is crucial to maintaining power. The largest threat to Mr Maduro's rule is not the opposition, but ultra-low international oil prices. Weak oil rents could lead to cracks within the regime and could fuel mass social unrest, owing to severe shortages of fuel and food. We acknowledge, however, that the risks of a political transition are currently very high.

- Venezuela ranks as the least attractive location of the 82 countries covered in our rankings in the 2020-24 forecast period. The severe macroeconomic crisis is a key factor in this forecast, posing challenges for business through its impact on income and purchasing power, the migration of a sizeable share of the population (approaching 20%) abroad and the destruction of virtually all of the country's non-oil manufacturing capacity. Government policy deters foreign investment through capital controls, a heavy tax burden and a weak commit-ment to creating a level playing field for foreign firms. All of these challenges will become even harder to address in the context of the coronavirus pandemic and the collapse in oil prices.

- A combination of highly distortionary economic policies and subdued global oil prices will prolong Venezuela's recession in 2020. Large budget deficits-owing to a narrow revenue base and dropping oil production-will continue to spur money printing, driving inflation. Oversupply of local currency and falling exports will yield significant bolívar depreciation. Our fore-casts for 2021-24 are more positive, based on the assumption that international oil prices will bounce back somewhat, thus improving oil revenue and giving way to relatively macroeconomic stability. However, real economic recovery and growth will not occur under the current administration.

- Amid the political and economic crisis, Venezuela's population has declined in recent years owing to outmigration, with over 5.1m Venezuelans estimated to have left since 2014; this has resulted in population growth declines in 2015-19. We forecast that mass outward migration will continue, owing to the lack of employment and goods shortages in Venezuela. Given that many of the refugees and migrants will have been of working age, this will result in a higher old-age dependency ratio. This ratio will remain low by developed-country standards, but population ageing will place growing pressure on the heavily indebted social security system in a context of volatile public finances.

- Years of economic crisis and hyperinflation have decimated the Venezuelan economy; in real terms it is now two-thirds smaller than it was in 2013. Our forecast for Mr Maduro to retain power assumes that a strong economic recovery is unlikely in the coming years. The economic crisis and falling real incomes will continue to restrict purchasing power. Although Venezuela is generously endowed with natural resources, extremely challeng-ing conditions will keep private-sector investment well below potential.

Growth of real GDP per head -0.1 2.9 1.8

Labour productivity growth 3.7 3.1 3.3
From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.

- Assuming that international oil prices will bounce back in 2021, we expect that Venezuela's economy will begin to recover. Nevertheless, this will not reverse the damage inflicted on the economy in recent years and economic growth will plateau in the long term. GDP growth will average only 1.1% annually in 2020-30. In 2031-50 we forecast that Venezuela's real GDP growth will pick up to 3.5%, as relative macroeconomic stability-a result of limited economic reforms from future governments-enables non-oil sector growth and boosts labour productivity growth, helping to offset deteriorating demographics. Persistent oil dependency will be difficult to undo, and a weak productive base will limit overall economic output.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013 proved unsuccessful. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his own popularity plummet as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices, combined with strict sanctions on trade from the US, has plunged the country into a severe economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly (AN). In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature to be in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017, a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the AN.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports, and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$20.9bn in 2018 as the destruction of domestic supply led to increasing import dependence. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates the 2018 current-account surplus to be 3.6% of GDP.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance The ruling party, originally called the Movimiento V República and transformed into the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) in 2006, has been in power since 1999. The populist-nationalist PSUV was initially ruled by the late president, Hugo Chávez (1999-2013). Since Mr Chavez's death, the party has been led by Nicolás Maduro. Over most of its tenure, the PSUV has wielded practically uncontested power, initially owing to Mr Chavez's immense popularity, and later through electoral manipulation and systematic campaigns to disenfranchise opposition parties and sideline them from state institutions. The opposition is diverse and contested the 2015 election as part of the Mesa de la Unidad Democrática coalition, winning a majority in the National Assembly (AN)-although the group's largest party, Acción Democrático, left the coalition in July 2018. However, following the opposition's victory, the government sought to make the AN essentially powerless, and convened a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly (ANC) that has granted itself remit over all legislative matters. The politicised Supreme Court and the executive have recognised the ANC, turning it into the country's de facto legislature and relegating the AN.
Mr Maduro's controversial re-election in May 2018 was declared illegitimate by the AN, leading that body's president, Juan Guaidó, to declare himself interim president of the country in January 2019 (when Mr Maduro's disputed new term began). In this claim, Mr Guaidó has support from the majority of the international community, including most Latin American democracies and the US. Although the regime had set the ANC as the de facto legislature, Mr Maduro's actions tacitly recognise the opposite. The regime understands that the AN holds an important legitimacy among the inter-national community, which limits his room for manoeuvre in terms of foreign policy. Thus, Mr Maduro has sought to undermine Mr Guaidó's control over the AN through gambits, such as forcing opposition legislators into exile or physically closing down the legislative palace. Indeed, Mr Maduro is eyeing the December 2020 legislative elections, in which the regime is set to regain control of the AN, as the elections will be neither free nor fair.

Political outlook: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit considers that the spread of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) and the collapse of international crude oil prices present the greatest challenges to date to the survival of the military regime led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV). These simultaneous crises have shattered the relative stability that had developed in recent months. With the onset of the crises, shrinking oil revenue will add significant pressure to the regime's finances. Hyperinflation and bolívar depreciation will worsen, with shortages of food and fuel making a comeback. In addition, owing to the bleak state of the country's healthcare system, Venezuela faces an uphill battle against the coronavirus and there is a high risk that the ongoing socioeconomic crisis will evolve into a humanitarian calamity.
Mr Maduro is wary of the potential political ramifications of the coronavirus outbreak in Venezuela. With US dollars ever more scarce, severe shortages of goods and public services are likely over the coming months. Together with the government's mandatory social-distancing measures, which will further curb incomes, significant bouts of social unrest are likely.
However, despite these compounding social and economic shocks-and the US sanctions already in place-we expect Mr Maduro to retain power throughout 2020, ruling over what is becoming a much less populous and much poorer country. Mr Maduro has two main factors in his favour. First, the opposition led by the head of the National Assembly (AN), Juan Guaidó, has lost the momentum that it held in 2019. Although Mr Guaidó enjoys widespread international recognition as the legitimate leader of Venezuela, the current public health crisis is demonstrating once again that his interim government has no de facto power. Secondly, the regime retains strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces. Although the risks to our forecasts are very high, we assume that this control-together with the complexity of the security apparatus and the recurrent purges within it-will allow the regime to manage internal dissent.
Although it is not part of our baseline forecast, we recognise that there is an extremely high risk of some sort of political transition. There are three main paths to this: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We assess the prospect of military action, by the US or Colombia, as low. A negotiated transition would also be difficult, in our view. In early March the US outlined a transition framework in which both Mr Maduro and Mr Guaidó would allow a new state council to be created and fresh elections to be held. Mr Guaidó himself recently called for the creation of a "national emergency government" (which would not include Mr Maduro) to better combat the coronavirus epidemic. However, both proposals (and other negotiated solutions) are likely to fail, as trust issues between the sides are insurmountable. In March the US indicted 14 top chavista officials, including Mr Maduro, discouraging the regime from co-operating on a negotiated exit. Nevertheless, successful talks with Colombia regarding humanitarian and/or health assistance are possible.
We believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The regime's main weakness is the fragility of its internal finances. Its patronage system is crucial for sustaining its security apparatus and resisting social unrest. Furthermore, the collapse in international crude prices and the dampening effect of a global recession on workers' remittances will shrink dollar inflows. The regime will continue to benefit from funds from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities, but a lack of hard currency could prove fatal to the patronage system and will test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks. The regime's liquidity problems and a rapidly worsening socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis could prompt putsch attempts in the near term.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Venezuela will continue to suffer in the 2020-24 forecast period from the weakest political and institutional framework in the region. Two decades of rule by the PSUV have engendered low institutional effectiveness and high levels of corruption, largely owing to the centralisation of power within the executive branch. Questions around the credibility of the country's institutions, and a lack of accountability and transparency, will continue. For example, massive corruption and clientelism in the provision of subsidised goods and utilities will remain a risk for political effectiveness. Similarly, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA, the Venezuelan state-owned oil company) is an enormous source of direct and indirect profits for regime insiders and the company will continue to be run by army personnel, and not by technocrats.
In an eventual political transition (not our baseline forecast), there would still be little progress in addressing these shortcomings, as approving numerous structural frameworks and eliminating inherent vested interests would require considerable political capital, which will probably be in short supply. A new government, which would undoubtedly include former chavistas, would be constrained by public demands to punish corruption in the previous admin-istration, balanced against the practical need to keep PSUV regime members and bureaucrats onside.
Moreover, a political transition could similarly exacerbate existing problems, such as violent crime, which is currently fuelled by corruption in the judiciary and law enforcement. This could be aggravated by the disbanding of colectivos (armed pro-PSUV civilian groups), which would continue to operate as armed gangs under a future government.
Drug-trafficking will remain a worrisome issue, with criminal networks well established in the country. US authorities have repeatedly accused high-ranking military and civilian government members of drug-trafficking (those accused deny the allegations). Furthermore, the homicide rate has risen sharply over the past 15 years. According to official figures, Venezuela recorded a homicide rate of 58 per 100,000 people in 2015, although private sources claim that the rate was much higher. Subsequent measurements by a well-regarded local think-tank, the Observatorio Venezolano de Violencia, put the national murder rate in 2019 as high as 60.3 per 100,000 people, a slight reduction from 2017, but still the highest regionally and among the highest in the world. Aside from homicides, there have been numerous high-profile kidnappings for ransom in urban areas, a development that has increased concern over police corruption and mis-management. This increase in criminality will not be halted unless measures are adopted to improve the competence and effectiveness of law enforcement agencies and the criminal justice system, to reduce rates of impunity, and to boost youth employment.
Political outlook: Election watch Legislative elections will take place in December, assuming that Mr Maduro clings to power and that the regime does not cancel the polls (Mr Maduro has hinted that the elections could be suspended owing to the coronavirus pandemic). These elections would be neither free nor fair, and the opposition would lose control of the AN. If the opposition were to secure some sort of political change in 2020, the interim government would pursue deep-seated reforms to the electoral authority and attempt to hold a vote within 12 months of its formation, although achieving this would be a major challenge.
Political outlook: International relations Mr Guaidó has marshalled strong support from the international community, but efforts by most governments in Latin America to support him have reached an impasse. Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, the US, has instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions-most recently severe restrictions on US oil firm Chevron's operations in Venezuela-and has openly called for the Venezuelan military to accept him in place of Mr Maduro. The US expects sanctions to put enough pressure on the regime's finances (and therefore on its patronage system) so that Mr Maduro is forced to hold free and fair elections. The US also warned of additional sanctions in the near future. The US admin-istration will remain hawkish in its approach to foreign policy, but we believe that a military intervention is unlikely, given the aversion of the US president, Donald Trump, to such adventurism. If tensions rise and political violence increases, the possibility of smaller-scale interventions cannot be discounted.
Mr Maduro's main international backers are Cuba, Russia and China. Russia is helping Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA, the Venezuelan state-owned oil company) to circumvent US sanctions; in March, the Venezuelan assets of Rosneft (a Russian energy company) were transferred directly to Russia, representing a step-up in the US-Russia diplomatic crossfire over Venezuela. Nevertheless, both Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the financing-amounting to tens of billions of US dollars per year-required to stabilise the economy and secure PDVSA's long-term future. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries, but seems to have had little success in securing finance for investment. If a transition from the Maduro regime were to come about, we believe that Russia and China would be willing to work with Mr Maduro's successor to protect their current investments. Furthermore, at present Iran is reportedly helping to fix the Amuay oil refinery in exchange for gold shipments.

The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings placed Venezuela among the world's least attractive investment locations during the historical period (2015-19). The country deteriorates further during the 2020-24 forecast period, leaving it ranked as the worst place to do business in the 82 countries covered by our rankings.
The poor score reflects a combination of political conflict, an erosion of the legal framework for investors, and a state-led model that hampers private enterprise and competition. Highly distortionary macroeconomic policy measures have created critical economic problems that have paralysed the investment climate, most noticeably through extreme difficulties in purchasing foreign exchange and remitting profits. Recurrent goods shortages, combined with the regime's highly expansionary fiscal and monetary policy stance, have generated hyperinflation.
The macroeconomic collapse poses significant challenges for businesses because it has fundamentally altered income patterns and Venezuelans' purchasing power, has forced a sizeable share of the population (approaching 20%) to migrate and has destroyed virtually all of the country's non-oil manufacturing capacity. All of these challenges will become harder to address in the context of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and the collapse in oil prices. Our underlying forecasts for the business environment are based on the political assumption that the regime led by Nicolás Maduro remains in place, but there is an extremely high level of uncertainty regarding this projection, given the unprecedented challenges that the coronavirus-led crisis brings. Yet, even if the regime was overthrown and a more market-friendly administration was in power, the extent of dislocation means that it would take several years to put the country on a firmer footing.

Business environment outlook: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: Expansion of interventionist measures, including price controls. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and continue to undermine free competition.
2022-24: Contract rights remain weak, and red tape and ad hoc interventionism continue.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Most attempts to attract investment prove unsuccessful, owing to political and economic instability.
2022-24: Actual investment flows remain low amid ongoing economic volatility. Intellectual property protection and private property rights deteriorate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: Currency controls are weakened, but access to foreign currency will remain limited.
2022-24: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, while de facto dollarisation advances. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves as oil prices rise, albeit slowly.
Taxes 2020-21: Risk of further unrest and political instability reduces probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major rise in public spending.
2022-24: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2020-21: Inflation remains high, and concerns surrounding economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2022-24: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2020-21: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Past emigration of skilled labour aggravates skills shortages.
2022-24: Labour-market rigidities persist, despite some increase in flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2020-21: Underinvestment in water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts.
2022-24: Investors remain highly cautious of committing to long-term capital projects. Infrastructure deteriorates even further.
Technological readiness 2020-21: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment, but with little interest.
2022-24: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

The macroeconomic environment will remain very weak During the forecast period, Venezuela's macroeconomic environment is ranked as the least attractive of all 82 countries covered in our rankings. The economy has contracted sharply for six consecutive years, aggravated by three years of hyperinflation and a sizeable drop in oil production, from 2.4m barrels/day (b/d) in 2015 to an average of 860,000 b/d in 2019. This reflects a combination of long-running underinvestment in Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA, the state oil firm), little private investment, deep-seated corruption and, since 2019, the impact of US oil sanctions and nationwide power cuts.

- The coronavirus pandemic and collapse in oil prices will place huge strains on the already critical economy. Shrinking oil revenue will add significant pressure to the regime's finances, which will aggravate shortages of food and fuel, and worsen hyperinflation and bolívar depreciation. Venezuela will be disprop-ortionately, negatively hit because of the legacy of years of incompetent policymaking. The fact that Venezuela is in default on its external debt means that no sources of external finance will be available to cushion the impact on the domestic economy. Foreign reserves have already been nearly entirely wiped out, leaving the economy completely exposed to the deterioration in external demand under way as a result of the coronavirus. Unless the Maduro regime is replaced by a more market-friendly government (not our baseline forecast), there is little prospect of a material improvement in macroeconomic conditions during 2020-24.

Distortionary measures and price controls will remain the regime's norm The score for policy towards private enterprise and competition will remain extremely weak in 2020-24 and Venezuela's ranking in this category will place it among the least business-friendly of the 82 countries assessed in the business environment rankings. Operating conditions have long been challenging, but the Maduro regime will refuse to alter its stance-characterised by bias against free markets, politicised and inefficient institutions, and widespread price-fixing-despite supply constraints amid a deepening economic crisis. Hopes that greater currency and debt pressures will force Mr Maduro to adopt a more pragmatic approach are likely to be dashed. Uncertainty over contract and property rights, distortionary price and exchange controls, and the cumbersome burden of government regulation will continue to restrict businesses' freedom to compete under Mr Maduro. In the context of the institutional decay that has occurred in recent years, improving competition policy (as well as restricting lobbying and corruption) would require an overhaul of regulatory bodies and legal frameworks. This will not occur under Mr Maduro; even if his regime is replaced by a more market-friendly administration (not our baseline forecast), the process of improving competition policy would take several years.

- Even though there have been fewer outright seizures of private companies under Mr Maduro compared with his predecessor, Hugo Chávez (1999-2009), there will be a high and ongoing risk of state interference in 2020-24. Politically sensitive industries, including those with access to foreign exchange (including energy and financial services) and those selling goods that are prone to shortages (including food retailers), are particularly vulnerable. The regime has used accusations of black-market transactions, or of increasing retail prices too aggressively as a pretext for uncompensated state intervention. Most recently, in April the Maduro administration took over the management of Alimentos Polar (the country's largest private-sector food manufacturer), as well as two meat producers, Plumrose and Matadero Turmero, following accusations that the firms had flouted previous price agreements. Raids, fines and confiscations on retailers violating maximum prices are a common occurrence and will continue during the forecast period.
- Price controls on a wide range of goods have been in place for most of the past 17 years. Periods in which the regime has eased controls-most recently in mid-2019 until April 2020-have been quickly followed by a renewed tightening, usually in response to rampant inflation and slippages in global oil prices (which have the effect of cutting foreign-exchange earnings and therefore hampering the country's import capacity). Price controls affect food manu-facturers and retailers, with a broad range of food staples, including meat, dairy, cooking oil, flour and rice, featuring on the regime's latest list of price-controlled goods. Price controls are also applied to domestic petrol sales and utility rates. Managed prices are regularly lifted in the context of hyperinflation, but soaring overheads means that firms may operate at a loss. Some degree of price controls is likely to be reimposed on an even larger number of products during 2020-21, which will continue to undermine the operating environment for businesses.

Foreign investment will remain scarce Venezuela's score and ranking for policy towards foreign investment slip further between the historical and forecast period. On the assumption that the Maduro administration clings to power, there is little prospect of any friendlier approach towards foreign investment from the Maduro regime, despite the fact that investment is desperately needed to rebuild the decimated domestic productive capacity. Although the 1999 constitution establishes national treatment for foreign capital, in practice both the Chávez and Maduro administrations have prioritised investment from firms tied to, or owned by, friendly governments. However, as funding from China has dried up, economic necessity has driven the regime to be less selective about the sources of investment. Given extreme economic and policy instability, we do not believe that this will result in a significant increase in investment inflows (or an improvement in operating conditions for foreign firms). Given that the Venezuelan government remains in default on its external debt obligations, firms would not be able to access invest-ment protection schemes, adding a further disincentive.

- The fact that the World Bank's International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) is currently considering 17 cases lodged by firms affected by government nationalisation-most of which have dragged on for several years-will deter foreign investment, particularly as there is little indication that the Maduro regime has either the desire or the funds to make compensation payments. Indeed, about 30 cases have already been concluded by the ICSID, but the regime has only agreed payment plans on a limited number of these cases, and only under threat of seizures in foreign courts.

Easing currency controls will prove difficult and will progress only slowly This category is the only area of the business environment in which we expect a slight improvement in conditions, leading to a small improvement in Venezuela's global and regional ranking. This mainly reflects the lifting of exchange-rate controls in 2019, with individuals and companies now able to buy or sell foreign currency at private and state-run banks, which has brought the bolívar somewhat closer to its black-market value. Notwithstanding the improvement, however, Venezuela continues to rank extremely poorly in this area. Despite the lifting of currency controls, there remain significant barriers to accessing US dollars in the context of extremely limited supply and the regime still intervenes in foreign-exchange markets if necessary. With global oil prices likely to remain depressed in 2020-21-and rise only moderately in 2022-24-supply of foreign currency is likely to be restricted, hampering foreign trade. Trade policy will remain incoherent and Venezuela remains an unreliable partner, racking up significant debt in unpaid invoices to suppliers. The country has been subject to increasingly tight US sanctions on financial transactions, as well as on the country's oil trade. These restrictions will remain in place as long as the Maduro regime is in office.

- Given that hyperinflation is likely to take hold again in the coming months, another currency denomination or even the introduction of a new currency is possible at some point during the forecast period. There has long been speculation that the country's deep currency distortions might force Mr Maduro to replace the currency with the US dollar; until recently, we believed that deep-seated political aversion to the adoption of the currency of a foreign-policy foe made outright dollarisation unlikely. However, Mr Maduro has shifted his stance in recent months, with the Venezuelan leader demonstrating greater openness towards the wider use of the US dollar in Venezuela. After years of labelling the US dollar a "criminal" currency, Mr Maduro has welcomed the existence of the US dollar. Many domestic transactions are now conducted in US dollars, with most shops now accepting payment in dollars. Although a formal abandonment of the bolívar and the adoption of the US dollar as the country's official currency does not form part of our baseline scenario, it is a possibility within the forecast period.
- Difficulty in remitting profits earned in Venezuela will remain one of the most significant challenges of doing business for foreign companies operating in the country. Official permission is required to remit profits, but with critical shortages of foreign exchange, remittances face long delays. Many foreign-owned companies have not been able to remit their profits for many years. In the context of massive local-currency depreciation, the waitlisted profit remittances have seen their US dollar value erode significantly.
- Foreign trade will continue to suffer from US sanctions that have been in place for several years against several government individuals, but have been ramped up significantly since 2017 and now target the country's com-mercial infrastructure, including its financial and energy sectors. In 2017 the US president, Donald Trump, issued an executive order that prohibited Venezuelan government entities, including PDVSA, from accessing US financial markets; this was followed by another executive order in May 2018 that prohibited dealings in Venezuelan debt issues. In January 2019 the US Treasury Department sanctioned PDVSA, blocking its property held in US jurisdictions and prohibiting it from engaging in transactions with US entities (companies or individuals). The US has warned non-US countries and companies that it is considering punitive action if they continue to trade with Venezuela, but has so far drawn short of applying sanctions on third parties. Sanctions will remain in place as long as the Maduro regime is in office.

Improvements in the tax regime are unlikely given fiscal constraints The tax regime will remain a barrier to investment, with fiscal constraints prompting a further deterioration in this area during the forecast period. Rates of direct corporate taxation are currently moderate, with a top corporate income tax rate of 34% (excluding oil companies, for which the rate is set at 50%), but tax laws, regulations and procedures are complicated, inconsistent and subject to frequent arbitrary adjustments. The system is extremely complex: according to the World Bank's 2020 Doing Business survey, 99 separate payments are required each year for businesses to comply with tax requirements (compared with a Latin American average of 28), taking 920 hours to complete (compared with a Latin American average of 317 hours). The tax burden is heavy, accounting for 73% of profits (the regional average is 47%). A series of new taxes introduced in 2009 in many cases doubled the effective tax rate on earnings. These taxes formed part of wider reforms such as a sports law, a new science and technology law, a worker training law, and a municipal law, but included new fiscal charges on businesses-some of which are levied on gross revenue rather than net earnings. The weakening fiscal outlook in the context of the coronavirus pandemic and plummeting global oil prices will severely limit the scope for tax cuts, and may even increase the tax burden on businesses.

- It is difficult to assess exactly how narrow the tax base is currently: according to the latest official data disclosed by Venezuela's tax authority (Seniat), tax income accounted for just 12% of GDP in 2012. The Seniat regularly reports large increases in tax collection, but with hyperinflation, tax collection is actually shrinking in real terms, implying that the tax base has shrunk even further in recent years. Despite this, we do not believe that tax rises are likely under the current administration. Mr Maduro has shown little interest in raising revenue to offset significant increases in public spending and he appears content with financing the huge fiscal deficit through public debt issuance, which is monetised, driving hyperinflation.
- The fiscal regime will do little to encourage new investment in 2020-24. In theory, Venezuela offers both foreign and domestic investors a full and equal range of investment incentives, including tax exemptions, special credit financing, export incentives and debt-equity swaps. The federal government also operates a number of state-run lending institutions that focus on micro, small and medium-sized businesses. Corporación Venezolana de Guayana, the state industrial-holding company, also offers investment incentives, as do many states and municipalities. However, there is no evidence that the Maduro regime is actually making the benefits of these investment incentives available to businesses.

Financing conditions will remain difficult Venezuela's score for financing deteriorates further in the forecast period, given the weak state of the banking sector, and on the assumption that improvements in access to medium-term finance for the private sector are highly unlikely during 2020-24, as is eliminating distortions in the financial sector. Financial sector distortions will remain severe, with the regime set to continue its policy of directed lending, which requires private banks to channel credit to specific sectors at preferential rates (including agriculture, mortgages and tourism). Despite huge increases in nominal lending in local-currency terms, this reflects captive domestic liquidity, hyperinflation and deeply negative real interest rates. In both real and US dollar terms, the financial sector has shrunk dramatically in recent years, resulting in a shallow credit market. We do not expect any significant rationalisation of the financial sector within 2020-24; as such, financing will remain a major weakness of the business environment throughout the forecast period.

- The soundness of the financial system and the quality of regulation will remain key concerns. Legislative changes in recent years have not resulted in a tighter regulatory framework, but have simply established new layers of bureaucracy. There has been no concerted effort to tackle the patchy enforcement of existing regulations. Weak skills in regulatory agencies and political meddling in oversight decision-making will remain problems, and will continue to undermine efforts to identify and support ailing banks at an early stage. Improving the quality of financial sector regulation is unlikely to be achieved, given a lack of political will.
- State intervention will continue to have an impact on the health and profitability of the banking industry. The state already has a substantial direct presence in the industry through full ownership of three of the top ten banks, and is prone to intervention in private-sector lenders.

Recent large-scale emigration will hamper the labour market in 2020-24 Venezuela's labour market is forecast to deteriorate further in 2020-24, mainly reflecting increased skills shortages following the departure of large numbers of Venezuelans in recent years. Even though the coronavirus outbreak has slowed outward migration sharply, this is set to resume in the second half of 2020 and few of the skilled Venezuelans who have left the country are likely to return until the economy is on a much firmer footing (if at all). The economy's informal sector is large and employs a substantial portion of the country's workers. The highly distorted exchange-rate system makes it very difficult to assess wage costs in US dollar terms, in comparison with the rest of the region. Venezuela's labour laws were already among the most rigid in the world, even before a highly restrictive labour reform came into effect in 2012. This increased non-wage costs considerably: obligatory non-wage costs, employers' social security contributions, mandatory profit sharing, and childcare and food allowances added more than 70% to the basic wage costs for large and medium-sized companies, and 30% for smaller companies.

- The mass exodus of Venezuelans leaving the country will put significant constraints on the labour market during 2020-24, particularly in terms of companies' ability to find skilled labour. As of April, the UN estimates that 5.1m Venezuelans-about 18% of the population-had fled the country. Although outward migration has virtually halted in the wake of the coronavirus pan-demic, with some reports of Venezuelans even returning across land borders as informal-sector work in Colombia and Brazil has dried up, we expect the numbers of Venezuelans leaving the country to start to pick up again once lockdowns in neighbouring countries are lifted. This will worsen skill shortages further. This situation will be aggravated by the fact that chronic under-investment in education in recent years means that even basic skills are scarce in much of the workforce, while political interference in universities and technical colleges has damaged the quality of the country's tertiary education system.
- Wage and non-wage costs come on top of a long-standing firing freeze, under which staffing levels (excluding managers, short-term workers and high-income earners) can be reduced only via collective agreement. Many workers cannot be fired at all, even in cases of stealing company property or failing to come to work. In practice, companies looking to shed staff are forced to negotiate "voluntary redundancy" agreements with workers; these typically centre on extremely generous severance payments, further adding to employment costs. Employment tribunals are generally hostile to private-sector employers, a factor used by workers and union representatives to their advantage. Moreover, companies that make recourse to voluntary redundancies have at times been targeted for nation-alisation, representing a further disincentive for the private sector.

Electricity provision will remain a critically weak area of infrastructure Following years of mismanagement and underinvestment, Venezuela's infrastructure has fallen into critical disrepair and we expect further slippage in 2020-24. Repeated pledges by the Maduro administration to implement ambitious infrastructure projects have come to nothing, with state-led investment drying up entirely in recent years. Even routine maintenance has not been completed, with current prolonged power shortages and limited access to running water the most visible manifestation of this failure to sustain basic service provision. The coronavirus outbreak will pose even greater fiscal constraints and, coupled with the ongoing difficulty of attracting long-term foreign direct investment (FDI) into capital projects, will compound the dismal state of the country's infrastructure. Given pervasive corruption in state institutions, even multilateral assistance is unlikely to be particularly forthcoming, sustaining problems of limited power and fresh water supply. Even if a new, more market-friendly, government took office during the forecast period (not our baseline scenario), reversing the long-term underinvestment in infrastructure would take many years.

- Reliable access to electricity will be one of the most significant challenges for businesses operating in Venezuela in 2020-24. Although the country has long faced sporadic power outages, the situation has deteriorated sharply in recent years, which on occasion has forced the government to request that workers remain at home while the authorities try to restore power. Some companies have opted to install backup generators, but this is a costly solution that does not solve all operational problems, as businesses find it difficult to find fuel and staffs face difficulties getting to work during blackouts. The supply of fresh water has been seriously affected, while communication, financial and transport networks have also been interrupted. Insufficient investment in maintaining the generation and transmission systems in recent years are to blame. Electricity tariffs have been kept extremely low, leading to rapid growth in demand. Water levels at the Guri dam-which generates most of the country's hydropower (which, in turn, accounts for more than 50% of total electricity generation)-have recovered from critically low levels, but with recent damage to several transformers at the dam, power generation currently stands at considerably less than the total installed capacity of 24,000 MW. Even if the government had the funds, overhauling the entire system would take years-meaning that blackouts (and possible electricity rationing) will persist throughout the forecast period.

Venezuela is not well prepared for technological disruption As in virtually all other categories of the business environment rankings, Venezuela's already weak technological readiness ranking deteriorates even further during 2020-24. Given the scale of the economic crisis, modernising technology provision and digitalising services will remain far from a govern-ment priority. The crisis will continue to take its toll on the telecommunications sector, with falls in disposable income leading to an ongoing decline in mobile-phone penetration (which has already fallen steadily since 2013 and now only stands at about 60%). Internet penetration has also since fallen; both are now among the lowest rates in the region. Given that these areas are critical to driving broader technological developments, including mobile apps and cloud computing, Venezuela's slippage in these areas are important factors explaining the country's weak score. Regulation and governance also remain relative weak points, while the long-running economic crisis has deterred private investment, which in turn has hampered research and development, and the number of patent applications.
Skills shortages will undermine Venezuela's long-term growth
- Price and tariff regulations affect the quality of technological infrastructure in Venezuela, because high consumption levels are not matched by capital expenditure. Chronic underinvestment in scientific and technical skills, and massive "brain drain" also limit Venezuela's technological readiness. Moreover, acute skills shortages in technology will not be resolved in the short term, and private investors will want to wait for the political and economic situation to improve significantly (which is not expected within the forecast period) before making substantial capital expenditure commitments.
- Although the Maduro regime, like the Chávez government before it, sought to direct state investment towards a variety of high-tech sectors, resources have been allocated inefficiently. For instance, the administration funded the construction of a factory to manufacture mobile telephones, but underinvested in the mobile network infrastructure, leading to poor service. Similarly, the government also built a factory to build educational computers, but school curriculums, educational materials and teaching standards have not been revised to train children in computer programming.
- Internet and mobile-network services are some of the cheapest in the world. However, lags in price adjustments make it difficult to cover the rising cost of maintaining the level and quality of the services. In addition, theft of equip-ment from companies' network infrastructure is common. As a result, service is unreliable and internet speeds are low compared with neighbouring countries.

Economic forecast: Policy trends The regime led by Nicolás Maduro will focus on weathering the collapse in oil prices and containing the looming public health crisis caused by the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak. At the time of writing, the country had 414 reported cases of the virus and had reached Stage 4 (community spread). To contain the spread, Mr Maduro announced a mandatory nationwide quar-antine set to be extended until at least mid-June, and made the wearing of facemasks compulsory. To cushion the adverse effects of social distancing on people's incomes, Mr Maduro also announced extraordinary cash transfers and rent deferrals, but funds to finance such measures are scarce. Reflecting a lack of confidence in the government's ability to support incomes, quarantine restrictions have barely been followed; many workers lack savings to survive without continuing to work. Furthermore, the country's medical infrastructure is poor and hospitals face significant shortages of water, soap, medicines and electricity. Venezuela's health system is simply unprepared to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. The regime's overall lack of policymaking capacity will lead to accelerating hyperinflation, sharper bolívar depreciation and an even steeper recession in 2020.
Based on The Economist Intelligence Unit's view that Mr Maduro will retain power for the duration of the 2020-24 forecast period, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that are required to resolve the economic crisis. De facto dollarisation is expanding; although this was not a tacit goal for the regime, Mr Maduro now welcomes it. Other under-the-radar adjustments are possible in the coming years, as long as these benefit the survival of the regime. Such efforts alone are unlikely to bring about economic stability, owing to the absence of a comprehensive microeconomic reform or improvements in rule of law, and policy predictability will not be forthcoming under the present regime.

Government debt 155.8 135.9 81.3 122.9 70.0 58.7
The authorities have not published complete data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect the non-financial public-sector deficit to narrow in 2020, and the public debt/GDP ratio to remain high in the coming years. The sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will curb government spending. The regime heavily relies on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Money printing will continue to finance the government's deficits in 2020-24. However, over the medium term, growing remittance inflows will partly offset the need to monetise budget deficits. At present, we assume no debt restructuring during the forecast period. The country's weak fiscal position is complicated by the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing-mainly debt issued by Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA, the state-owned oil firm) and development funds from China-that understates the true size of total public liabilities.
All of the sovereign's outstanding global bonds are in arrears. However, bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy shifts or a change in government. The key PDVSA 2020 bond, which was secured using 50.1% of the shares of Citgo (PDVSA's US subsidiary) as collateral, fell due at end-October 2019 and was not paid. A US court ruled that PDVSA is an "alter ego" of the Venezuelan government, which will have far-reaching implications, as some international firms are seeking to seize shares of Citgo stock. However, the US currently considers Citgo to be under Mr Guaidó's purview, thus shielding Citgo assets from seizure by creditors. However, once the PSUV retakes control of the (currently legitimate) AN, Citgo assets will no longer be safeguarded.

The government's financing needs will force the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) to ramp up money printing in the short term. Growing dollarisation and a strong contraction in domestic demand slowed hyper-inflationary pressures in 2019. However, we expect hyperinflation to return in the coming months, owing to monetisation of large fiscal deficits and severe goods shortages. Overall, hyperinflation will continue until its underlying causes are addressed. Hyperinflation has quickened the pace of dollarisation of the economy (more than 50% of transactions are now thought to be conducted in US dollars). We believe that Venezuela is heading towards overall de facto dollarisation. Monthly inflation will rise again in the short term and remain substantial. However, given the effect of dollarisation on price stability, we do not expect a return to the extremely high rates of annual inflation of over 1,000,000% experienced in 2018.

Economic forecast: Economic growth The impact of the coronavirus: global and regional assumptions The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) that originated in December 2019 in Wuhan, central China, is now a global pandemic. The Economist Intelligence Unit assumes that the virus will affect about 50% of the world population, including asymptomatic cases. Of the symptomatic cases, about 20% will experience severe symptoms and about 1% will not recover. Death ratios will depend on a country's capacity to detect, track and contain the virus, and the capacity of its national health system. We believe that a mass vaccine will be available at end-2021 (at the earliest) and that the coronavirus will become a seasonal disease, with another outbreak likely in winter 2020/21.
Quarantine and social-distancing measures will be effective in limiting the spread, but they will have severe negative economic consequences. Disruptions to global supply chains will also be severe. Overall, we forecast that global output will contract by 2.5% in 2020, and that global trade will drop by 15.3%. All G7 countries and almost all G20 countries will experience a full-year recession. We forecast real GDP growth in China of only 1% in 2020 and a full-year recession in the US, with a contraction of 2.9%. We assume that oil prices will be 40% lower this year, averaging US$36/barrel. Most countries have responded with huge fiscal expansion to support businesses and households, raising the risk of sovereign debt crises in the medium term. Central banks have cut interest rates and, more importantly, have stepped up as buyers of last resort for government and corporate debt.
The infection curve in Latin America is about four to six weeks behind that of European countries and about two to three weeks behind that of the US. As such, cases are expected to peak in May in Latin America. Managing the health crisis in the region is particularly challenging, given overstretched hospitals, limited fiscal resources and the fact that large swathes of the population live in shanty towns with poor basic services and where social distancing is challenging. Although containment measures will remain the priority in the short term, the policy debate in Latin America will soon begin to turn towards how to plan for an easing of lockdown measures. In formulating exit strategies, Latin American governments will draw on all the data available relating to the progression of the pandemic and experiences in other regions. Their challenge will be to get the timing and phasing right, so that the numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths remain under control, health services can cope, public confidence in the handling of the crisis remains strong and the economy can recover. Exit strategies will be implemented gradually and reviewed on a regular basis. There is a risk that even a gradual and phased easing will expose countries to a second wave of infections (as has happened in Singapore and South Korea).
The coronavirus pandemic will have a severe economic impact. We forecast a Latin American recession in 2020, with a contraction of 5%, with output in all of the major economies contracting by 3-7%. Some Caribbean countries, which depend on tourism, will be hit even harder. Quarantine measures will result in a sharp supply-side shock, hitting working hours and productivity, and manufacturers will suffer from a disruption to global supply. Supply-side disruptions will be short-lived, but demand effects will be long-lasting. A decline in confidence is likely to persist after quarantine measures are lifted. For fear of contagion, people may continue to avoid public spaces, and tourism may not resume immediately. Households will limit their consumption in response to a loss of income, and businesses will delay investment.
The longer-lasting political and geopolitical impact of the crisis will be significant. The pandemic has resulted in an extraordinary expansion of executive powers, with limited parliamentary oversight. Elections have been cancelled, or delayed, in some countries. When the pandemic has passed, governments will face intense scrutiny on their response. A failure to address the humanitarian crisis triggered by the coronavirus could further erode trust in national institutions. A severe global economic crisis, followed by renewed fiscal austerity and large-scale unemployment, will fuel a new wave of popular protests. The crisis may encourage support for the nation state and a backlash against globalisation and open borders. The competition for global leadership between China and the US will intensify as a result of the crisis, and a realignment of geopolitical spheres of influence may ensue in Europe, Africa and other regions. This will provide a challenging environment for Latin America over the medium term as the region tries to grapple with the debt overhang from the extra spending measures and the hit to revenue, as well as lower potential growth rates, owing to the damage to productive sector value chains, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 36.2% in 2019 (and cumulative contraction of almost 70% since 2013), we expect a further decline, of 25.4%, in 2020. The contraction will follow the steep drop in crude prices and reflect the adverse effects of the government's quarantine measures, which-even if only partly followed-will further dent domestic demand. Ultra-low oil prices will hamper production, but most importantly, they will indirectly hit the non-oil economy through shortages of fuel and public services, scarcity of goods and reinvigorated hyperinflation. From a demand-side perspective, the GDP contraction will be driven by falling real incomes and continued mass emigration (which is fuelled by unemployment, violence and social instability).
The recent collapse in oil prices will put significant pressure on Venezuela to slash crude production. The country's average break-even price is about US$15-US$20/barrel. US sanctions on the regime raise the risks involved in dealing with Venezuela, forcing the country to offer a hefty discount on its crude. This means that, at current market prices, Venezuela is selling its oil at a loss (its oil basket reached US$15/b at end-April). Although the country seeks to produce as much oil as possible, the current circumstances will inevitably lead to cuts in production; we expect oil output to decline from 660,000 barrels/day (b/d) in March (according to OPEC), to 620,000 b/d on average in 2020. However, we believe that average output could fall as low as 500,000 b/d over the coming months.
In 2021 we expect the economy to grow marginally, owing to a stabilisation of oil output, base effects and the lifting of social-distancing measures. In 2022 economic growth will accelerate on the back of a surge in oil prices. However, in the medium term, oil output will continue to fall-albeit gradually-owing to serious operational problems (such as difficulties in obtaining equipment for repairs or finding qualified staff) and to a limited pool of suitable buyers of Venezuelan crude. Export volumes will start to recover marginally in 2022-24 (owing to moderately higher global oil prices), as producers become more accustomed to the new post-sanctions export markets. Furthermore, relative macroeconomic stability will allow the non-oil economy to recover marginally in the medium term. There are substantial risks to our forecasts, which assume that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout the forecast period. In the event of a transition, there would be upside risks to our medium-term baseline; the degree of improvement would depend on the characteristics of the transition and on the new government's macroeconomic programme.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends Oil sector: With proven levels approaching 300bn barrels, Venezuela has the largest reserves in the world, making it a major oil producer and exporter. However, the energy sector has suffered from disinvestment and mis-management owing to political interference. The state is accorded exclusive ownership of PDVSA and its subsidiaries. Since 2007, oil exploration, extraction and storage activities have been reserved for state-owned enterprises or companies in which the state holds a stake of at least 60%.
The latest PDVSA data put oil output at an average of 2.6m b/d in 2016, while OPEC estimates it at 2.2m, in line with data from the International Energy Agency (IEA). However, in early 2019 Venezuela's oil output fell drastically as nationwide blackouts and US sanctions have taken further toll on a sector decimated by corruption, underinvestment and mismanagement. Production stabilised at an average of 860,000 b/d in 2019, according to estimates from the IEA. However, oil production fell further in March-April 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic resulted in a collapse in global oil demand and a significant price decline. Oil output fell to 622,000 b/d according to OPEC, compared with 760,000 b/d in February. Official data are not available, but production estimates suggest that joint ventures with foreign investors have kept output from dropping further. As joint ventures deal predominately in heavy and extra-heavy oil, and as production of lighter oil is collapsing, PDVSA has been forced to import more diluents from abroad. Existing US sanctions have complicated their import, and have led Venezuela to rely further on blending its heavier crude with ones of a lighter grade to produce crudes to the liking of Venezuela's new main buyer-Asian markets. In early 2020, Russian energy firm Rosneft sold all of its Venezuelan assets in the face of US sanctions on the company. Although the assets were sold to another Russian firm, the support previously given to PDVSA will undoubtedly dwindle. Furthermore, the US announced that US oil firm Chevron will be forced to halt operations in Venezuela by end-2020. Additional measures such as these from the US will put further pressure on PDVSA this year (particularly if international prices remain at ultra-low levels).
PDVSA's main joint-venture partners are Russian firms (Gazprom, Lukoil and Rosneft), CNPC (the Chinese state oil company), Chevron and Eni (Italy). The government has shown a preference for Russian and Chinese firms, but even co-operation with these partners has reportedly been rocky at times, given (among other things) pervasive corruption at PDVSA, complex regulatory and planning requirements, difficulties securing foreign exchange to afford production imports, and criminality in areas surrounding at oil production and refining facilities.
Dwindling production and a punishing debt redemption schedule have stretched PDVSA's financing to its limits. At present, PDVSA is in arrears on all of its debt, including its 2020 bond. The latter security included 50% of Citgo, a PDVSA subsidiary, as collateral, and PDVSA's default has thus opened the door for creditors to seek the liquidation of Citgo's assets. The US Treasury has so far banned the seizure of Citgo's assets as the company is under Mr Guaidó's purview. Citgo traditionally has been a vital part of PDVSA's operations, as it refines and commercialises Venezuelan oil in the US-historically PDVSA's largest cash-paying market. Through the US Treasury's actions, the hope is that Citgo will remain an important government asset in any future administration.
Given the challenges arising from PDVSA's financial difficulties and perennial mismanagement, as well as US sanctions, the ongoing decline in output is irreversible for as long as the present regime remains in power. Seizure of Citgo's assets is likely as the Treasury will lift their bans if Mr Guaidó's claim for the presidency loses its legitimacy claim. With the prospect of further sanctions, oil output will remain volatility throughout 2020. Given PDVSA's inability to afford required new investment to ramp up production, the company could hand more of its operations to Russian and Chinse firms. However, prospects for structural overhauls to the current framework remain highly uncertain.

Severely reduced domestic supply, constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits will lead to a return to hyperinflation this year. Dollarisation and the regime's heavy restrictions on credit helped to subdue hyperinflation in the second half of 2019. However, inflationary pressures will intensify substantially in the coming months, owing to wide-spread goods shortages, the re-introduction of price controls on a number of goods and the ramping-up of government money printing. In the medium term, inflation will remain high for as long as the Maduro regime is in power, given huge fundamental imbalances between supply and demand, and the need for the regime to monetise its fiscal deficits. Weather-related shocks are a perennial risk to the inflation outlook.

Accelerating hyperinflation will quicken the pace of bolívar depreciation in 2020. Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency denomination (as in March 2018) or a new currency is a strong possibility, although the exact nature of such a move is hard to forecast. In mid-2019 the regime announced a loosening of currency controls. Although this was a positive move, significant barriers limit access to US dollars via formal means. We still believe that the government will maintain a number of indirect controls on the foreign-exchange market. In this context, a black-market exchange-rate premium is inevitable. On May 6th the official exchange rate was BsS160,150:US$1, compared with a black-market rate of BsS178,500:US$1. The premium (currently at 5.5%) is small by historical comparison.

Venezuela will post a small current-account deficit of 2.2% of GDP in 2020, owing to lower oil exports and limited remittance inflows resulting from the global recession. The BCV's official figures for 2017-18 show that Venezuela posted current-account surpluses in this period. In 2019 the collapse of goods export earnings (owing to US sanctions on the oil trade) hit the trade balance hard. Nevertheless, based on the latest data, we estimate that the current account remained in surplus as a result of growing inflows of workers' remittances and the non-payment of interest on bonded debt (saving in excess of US$5bn in 2019). We expect the current account to return to surplus in the medium term, averaging 5.9% of GDP in 2022-24. Goods exports will recover as international oil prices increase and the country steps up trade with Asian markets. This recovery will be supported by continued weakness in domestic demand, rising remittances from abroad and the fact that the sovereign will remain in default throughout the forecast period.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Venezuela Stocks and flows According to the IMF (whose figures differ somewhat from local sources), the stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Venezuela stood at US$30.1bn in 2016, the last year in which actual data have been provided. This is around one-third less than a peak of US$48.9bn in 2007 and is primarily the result of significant disinvestment, notwithstanding the government's long-standing capital controls. Given the massive decline in GDP in recent years, this means that the FDI stock is estimated at 27.4% of GDP in 2019 (forecast to rise to 49.3% of GDP this year, as GDP contracts further). Overall, FDI inflows have been very volatile in the past 20 years, affected by both political and macroeconomic factors. During the oil opening of 1996-98, inward FDI peaked at an annual average of US$4.5bn per year. By historical standards, inward FDI held up well in the first three years of the presidency of Hugo Chávez (1999-2003), averaging US$3.8bn per year in 1999-2001. As political conflict intensified, FDI inflows began to decline in 2002-08 (averaging US$1.8bn per year), and in 2009-a year of great volatility in the world economy and adverse domestic developments in Venezuela-the country registered disinvestment of US$1.1bn (some negative inflows were also the result of compensation for nationalisations). Inward FDI has recovered afterwards, averaging an estimated US$4.3bn per year in 2011-13, because of greater investment from China in energy and housing. It declined considerably afterwards, to US$1.9bn per year in 2014-16, likely as a reflection of both sliding international oil prices and foreign investors' increasing disillusionment with the government's inability to comply with investment agreements and manage the economy. Outbound FDI in Venezuela is considerable, reaching a stock of US$32.7bn in 2016. However, this tally is dominated by investments abroad by PDVSA, the state oil company.
Origin and distribution The energy sector, and oil in particular, remains the main magnet for FDI. US and European oil companies have major investments in the country, even after forced changes to the ownership structure of most contracts. After oil, banking and communications have been the main recipients of FDI. Spanish banks have the largest foreign presence in the financial sector, although the Venezuelan state has bought back some operations. Other notable FDI inflows come from Chile (in forestry activities) and Canada (in the mining industry). Owing to expanding US sanctions and restrictions, Venezuela has courted new investment partners in China, Russia and Iran, with limited success. The fact that these countries will continue to grapple with the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) throughout 2020 means that short-term efforts will be focused on seeking support on the oil and defence sectors.
Determinants Following a period of booming FDI inflows in the 1990s, driven by oil and telecommunications openings, an uncertain political and policy environment-including threats of nationalisation-and a volatile macroeconomic climate have served to keep FDI well below potential, particularly in the non-extractive sectors. In the extractive sector, FDI inflows have been affected by the government's restrictive hydrocarbons investment regime, which mandates that PDVSA must hold a minimum 60% stake in the oil and gas sector, and levies high taxes and royalties on private partners. The vast reserves of extra-heavy oil in the Orinoco Belt require substantial technical know-how and massive investment to be put to production, an environment where major oil companies would thrive. Many major companies are already present via joint ventures or were already present before nationalisation drives. Venezuela's oil sector will continue to be a major draw to FDI under more sustainable economic and regulatory policies.
Impact Foreign investment in oil brought accelerated growth in output, from 2.4m barrels/day (b/d) in 1994 to a peak of 3.4m b/d in 1999. Foreign investment in the extractive sector has fallen since then, contributing to a decline in oil output, reinforced by PDVSA's inability to drive production. Foreign involvement has had a less dramatic impact in other sectors, such as domestic manufacturing or services, but this in turn has resulted in high levels of import dependence. As FDI has flowed mostly into capital-intensive industries, its impact on employment and skills levels has been limited.
Potential Given the scale of economic mismanagement and poor maintenance of existing infrastructure and productive capacity, there is large potential for investment opportunities in Venezuela. Potentially attractive opportunities for FDI exist in an array of sectors, such as oil and gas, petrochemicals, coal, aluminium, gold, forestry, power, tourism, and telecoms. There is additional potential in some manufacturing and agricultural niches (for example, leather goods, cocoa and rum). However, FDI inflows will be severely curtailed by concerns over the current government's policy stance, difficulties in accessing foreign exchange, the weak macroeconomic environment and the fragility of the legal framework. A recovery in investment is unlikely under the leader of the regime, Nicolás Maduro, as exchange-rate distortions and controls local prices will remain unaddressed. A more noticeable upturn in FDI inflows will have to wait until after a political transition takes place and only if the new government were to engage in structural economic reforms.

As long as the current regime is in place, mass emigration will continue. Population growth will remain weak because of a falling birth rate and large-scale emigration. The annual population growth rate has been steadily decreasing from 2.8% in the 1980s to 2.3% in the 1990s and 1.8% in 2000-10. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the population declined by an average of 2.1% per year in 2015-19, as the economic crisis worsened. The UN High Commission for Refugees estimates that some 5.1m Venezuelans have left the country since 2014, with approximately 1.8m residing in neighbouring Colombia. The economic impact of the quarantine measures-applied by countries in the region to combat the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic-has affected earnings of Venezuelans abroad. Some are even returning to Venezuela-reportedly over 50,000 have come back from Colombia since April 2020. However, the inversion in migration flows will be short-lived. Regional economies will gradually reopen during 2020. This, together with a lack of employment and goods shortages at home, will cause migrants to continue leaving Venezuela. Therefore, our estimates for population growth in the 2020-24 forecast period assume that outward migration will continue. The total population is expected to reach 27.2m by 2024 (from an estimated peak of 30.9m in 2016), with just over one-quarter of the population under the age of 14 and two-thirds of the population between 15 and 64 years of age. Population density is low, at 34 people/sq km as per official estimates from 2017. Distribution between urban and rural areas is highly uneven, with about 90% of the total population living in urban centres. Underdeveloped rural infrastructure and limited job opportunities in the countryside will result in a continuing trend of urbanisation in 2020-24.
The labour participation rate declined in 2004-12 (owing to an increased uptake of education linked to the government's social programmes), but ticked up marginally in 2013 and 2014, before falling again in 2015 as economic conditions worsened because job seekers became discouraged. The government has stopped producing labour data, but we expect that continued economic contraction and diminishing real wages (we estimate that, in real terms, the minimum wage plus food vouchers has lost over 99% of its value since mid-2013) have driven participation down further. Participation rates will remain subdued in 2020-24. A very poor business environment, economic malaise and extremely restrictive labour regulation will continue to limit job creation, forcing more people to depend on the informal sector, which is already estimated to account for more than half of employment. According to the authorities, the official unemployment rate fell from 8.5% in 2010 to 6.8% in 2015. However, given that this coincided with a sharp deterioration in local economic conditions, it is likely that it reflects inflexible labour laws (which make it virtually impossible to lay off workers) rather than any significant job creation. It is also possible that the data are unreliable, as it is highly implausible that unemployment has remained low in the midst of a deep economic recession, with a growing number of companies folding.
Poverty indicators improved during the tenure of Hugo Chávez (1999-2013), but these data are no longer published by the authorities. Independent academic sources estimate that poverty rates have risen sharply in the context of collapsing economic activity and hyperinflation. A study by three well-regarded universities estimated the poverty rate at 87% in 2017. Shortages of medicines and surgical supplies are creating huge problems in the healthcare system, while insufficient vaccines are resulting in the re-emergence of diseases that had previously been practically eradicated.
Public services will remain under strain from a lack of resources The old-age dependency ratio will remain low by developed-country standards but, in the context of volatile public finances, population ageing will place growing pressure on the heavily burdened social security system. Public hospitals will continue to suffer from crumbling infrastructure, and a lack of supplies (including medicines) and equipment. The latter are mainly imported, or assembled from imported parts, and supplies have fallen victim to a lack of US dollars. Hospital building and rebuilding programmes have been a failure, owing to mismanagement of funds and shortages of building materials. Even a parallel welfare system, the Sistema Nacional de Misiones, is struggling to function as the government makes cuts and inflation erodes purchasing power. Overall, the provision and quality of public healthcare and education services is therefore expected to deteriorate further. The coronavirus pandemic will exacerbate these fragilities. This will also reflect long-running problems, including a pronounced deficit of technical and basic skills, and the continued emigration of professionals (particularly doctors and nurses).

The scale of Venezuela's economic crisis has led to a rapid decline in living standards, with GDP per head falling by over two-thirds, from a peak of US$12,291 in 2012, to an estimated US$3,933 in 2019. Estimates using purchasing power parity (PPP) give a higher figure of US$5,994. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a further decline in both GDP per head at market exchange rates and PPP by 2023, based on our expectation for the leader of the regime, Nicolás Maduro, to cling onto power during the 2020-24 forecast period, given that the country's severe economic imbalances will remain unaddressed.
Several factors will restrict purchasing power, including hyperinflation, and persistently high levels of poverty and income inequality. Although national statistics show a dramatic improvement in social indicators in recent years, the data have been disputed; independent studies have suggested that inequality has not fallen as quickly as the government indicates, and that the middle-income class has shrunk. According to the UN Human Development Programme, 6.6% of the population survived on less than US$1.25/day (in purchasing-power terms) in 2012, a higher proportion than in almost any other country in the region.
Investment potential will only be tapped after a political transition Venezuela is a reasonably sized consumer market and has the potential to become an attractive investment location. However, any benefits from this will not materialise until a more market-friendly administration takes over (not our baseline forecast). The country has vast reserves of natural resources (including oil, gas, coal and precious metals), an array of spectacular natural tourist attractions, relatively good physical infrastructure and a fairly favourable geographical location-given its proximity to the US. However, poor economic policies have contributed to a volatile GDP profile, and a deterioration of public services and human capital over the past two decades. The unattractiveness of the business environment is compounded by inadequate contract and property rights. Moreover, continued high poverty levels and a deterioration in health-care and education provision in the past three decades have contributed to an erosion of skills and productivity, which has also been exacerbated by an exodus of talented individuals to work abroad.

A weakened productive base will lead to recurrent shortages of goods In common with the rest of the Latin American region, spending on food, beverages and tobacco accounts for the largest share of total consumer expenditure, and this will remain the case throughout the forecast period. Sharp growth in mobile-telephone usage, and an underdeveloped urban public transport system and subsidised petrol are the main factors behind the relatively heavy weighting of expenditure on transport and communications. Most consumer goods industries will remain underdeveloped, owing to government controls and the country's severely damaged productive capacity. Furthermore, limited availability of foreign exchange has resulted in a scarcity of consumer goods that are not produced domestically. Looking forward, the scale of the country's ongoing recession will lead to major contractions in retail-sales volumes during the forecast period.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Although The Economist Intelligence Unit assumes that the leader of the regime, Nicolás Maduro, will retain power in the short to medium term, we expect successive governments in the longer term to put forth structural reforms to the oil sector and to make limited inroads in diversifying the economy. We therefore anticipate that Venezuela's real GDP per head will contract by an average of 0.1% in 2020-30 (this figure is also influenced by major contractions in 2018-20). Growth will average a healthier 2.9% in 2031-50, but the country's population is unlikely to reach a high standard of living within the forecast period. Indeed, by 2050 we forecast that per-head GDP at purchasing power parity will be US$18,100-a low value for a country with Venezuela's endow-ment of national resources. Although we expect the business environment to improve, the country's weak institutions, dependency on the extractive industry and a weak productive base will remain significant barriers to growth.
The macroeconomic collapse will impair the long-term productivity capacity Initial conditions: After averaging growth of 10% in 2004-08, real GDP fell sharply in 2009-10. Although the economy recovered in 2011-12 on the back of aggressive fiscal spending, growth slowed sharply again in 2013, with the economy slipping into a deepening recession in late 2014. We estimate that by the time the economy returns to growth in 2021, real GDP will have fallen by almost 75%, making the recession the country's most severe since compilation of national statistics data began. The heterodox policy framework that has been in place for over a decade has been a major factor in hampering GDP growth, while an opaque and distorted exchange-rate system has provided opportunities for corruption on a large scale, further undermining the institutional framework and maintaining income inequality. In addition, institutional deterioration is very deep-rooted and will prove harder to reverse. On a more positive note, a higher skills base and reasonably good road infrastructure by regional standards provide scope for faster overall growth and a rise in personal incomes. Nevertheless, underinvestment in human capital and infrastructure, as well as the emigration of most skilled labour, is eroding these advantages and, given fiscal difficulties, this trend will take time to reverse. Successive governments have failed to take advantage of Venezuela's proximity to developed US and European markets relative to its South American neighbours, as internal geography and a lack of investment in infrastructure in the interior have limited Venezuela's chances of becoming a regional hub for transport and commerce.
Demographic trends: As in most other emerging-market countries, growth in the working-age population will slow in the long term, while rising partici-pation rates will ensure that the labour force will grow at a brisker pace. Venezuela will continue to enjoy supportive population dynamics, with the dependency ratio of old to young low by comparison to OECD levels even in 2050. Even with life expectancy growing steadily, the share of the population aged 65 years and over will be only around 15% in 2050 (although rising from an estimated 6.6% in 2017), while the share of the population at working age will remain high, at 66%. A particular risk to productivity is the "brain drain" seen in recent years, as many experienced professionals have left the country to work abroad with no guarantee of returning.
Oil will remain crucial to Venezuela's economic prospects External conditions: Oil, which we estimate accounts for some 95% of export revenue at present, will continue to dominate the Venezuelan economy. Although there will be a limited drive to diversify the productive base in the long term, Venezuela will continue to be highly dependant on exports of oil and other commodities. During the eras of Hugo Chávez (1999-2013) and Mr Maduro, Venezuela and its allies have taken a confrontational stance against US policy and US-led efforts at economic integration. In the medium term, we expect Venezuela to continue to rely very heavily on oil and extractive industries, and to strengthen economic links with Asian markets and with existing political allies (Russia, Turkey, Iran, etc). In the longer term, however, we assume that successive governments will implement a number of structural economic and political reforms, which will allow Venezuela to somewhat diversify away from oil, and trade with the US will revivify.
Institutions and policy trends: We assume that some of the most distortionary elements of the current policy framework, including price and exchange controls, will be scaled back gradually as the regime deems their removal as essentially for their survival. However, the prospects for improvements in other aspects of the business environment are very low, as structural microeconomic reforms will not be forthcoming. For example, an improvement of the public finances will prove unfeasible unless international crude prices reach pre-2014 levels. Given that the economy will still be highly vulnerable to oil price fluctuations, the fiscal position will remain highly procyclical. Reforms to social security or labour legislation will only be possible under a potential new administration. In 2031-50 we assume that successive administrations will yield policy improvements; however, their effects will be slow to materialise given the country's institutional weakness.
Economic growth will only accelerate in the long term after structural reforms Long-term performance: Even once the most distortionary elements of current economic policy are abandoned, the deterioration of the skills base over the past decade will mean that Venezuela's potential GDP growth will have been eroded, although there is still some scope for recovery in 2021-40, when growth will average a respectable 4%. It will then slow down to an average of 3.1% in 2041-50. A higher trend rate of GDP growth will be possible in the long term under more market-friendly successive administrations, which we expect to go ahead with reforms to the country's long-standing economic and political policies. The overall economy will remain vulnerable to continuing cycles of boom and bust, with negative consequences for macroeconomic stability and growth, and constraining the prospects for catch-up with more developed economies, despite some solid projected growth late in the forecast period.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Venezuela is vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, owing to both geographical limitations and the government's inadequate focus on preparedness. Venezuela is deemed extremely vulnerable to climate change, given its population distribution along coastal lines on unstable terrains. About 75% of the country's population is estimated to live in the 20% of the territory facing the Caribbean Sea. Given low maintenance of infrastructure and little disaster preparedness, the population centres there are exposed to torrential rains, mudslides and flash floods. According to a recent study by a local and internationally recognised expert, Juan Carlos Sanchez, even within established rainfall patterns, variance has resulted in the growing number of extreme events per year in the past decade. Longer-term trends in rainfall will also affect the country. A study performed by the Universidad Simón Bolívar, a well-regarded university, has concluded that rainfall in the northwest of the country could fall by 25% by 2060. This would not only cause internal migration, but would also drive the country into further food insecurity (Venezuela is already heavily reliant on imports of foodstuffs). In addition, changing rain patterns may disrupt hydroelectricity generation, a major problem given that this represents more than 50% of the country's electricity.
The government has done little to address these challenges. Its public works programmes concentrate on traditional infrastructure projects and there is minimal focus in the way of disaster preparedness. In a recent forum with a UN delegation, authorities touted their plans to build apartment blocks in place of shantytowns, the logic being that concrete buildings would hold up to flooding better. There is scarce official data on carbon emissions or pollution in the country, but environmental policies are generally deemed poor by specialised observers. PDVSA, the state-owned oil firm, has been routinely accused of poor environmental protection in both its oil and gas operations. The Economist Intelligence Unit has developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth, and we find that the Venezuelan economy will be 4% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth.
Migration and urbanisation Venezuela experienced rapid urbanisation through the majority of the second half of the 20th century, as the country's oil wealth was developed. According to data from the World Bank, the percentage of urban population grew from 60% in 1960 to almost 90% by the late 1990s-high by global standards but in line with most large Latin American countries. Oil exports, especially at the start of this process, funded large-scale real estate developments and infrastructure works in budding urban centres, attracting prospective workers from the countryside. In addition to a growing middle class fed by spill-over from the country's oil wealth, the rural exodus towards the cities also created sprawling shantytowns across major metropolises, which public-housing programmes have been unable to eradicate. Income inequality in urban centres is especially acute, feeding crime and political tension. This is perhaps best exemplified by Caracas, the capital, where income and wealth disparities have correlated with voter preferences for the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) and opposition parties.
Emigration, previously a limited phenomenon, has become a major issue. No official data exist, but out of a total population of about 31m, local estimates put total emigration since 2013 at 5.1m people, with most having left in the past three years. These migrants were initially primarily driven by political reasons, but the exodus is also driven by criminal violence (Venezuela has one of the world's highest murder rates) and woeful economic conditions. Anecdotal evidence suggests that those leaving have been primarily young, well-trained professionals, which has harmed the economy's prospects further. Under our expectation of no political transition, outward migration is set to continue (albeit at smaller rates than in 2018-20). Skilled workers in particular will seek to move abroad, further dampening Venezuela's long-term growth potential.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2015-19) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2020-24). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2015-19. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2020-24 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2015-19 ranges are then used to derive 2020-24 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2020-24, not to the likely situation in 2024 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2017 or 2022). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the current government to serve out its second term, which will expire in 2024. We expect the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to run a highly centralised administration. The administration's Hindu nationalistic agenda could raise the incidence of communal violence.
- The government has extended a nationwide lockdown until May 3rd, to contain the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19). Some of the measures under the lockdown have been relaxed since April 20th. We maintain our view that the spread of the virus will be brought under control by June, although the World Health Organisation has warned that the premature lifting of containment measures is likely to cause a renewed spike in new cases.
- India's relations with the US will remain warm in 2020-24. However, disagreements on tariff and service-sector export restrictions will limit trade deals. Relations with China will remain strained, owing to border disputes and concerns about that country's ambitions in South Asia. Bilateral relations with Pakistan will also remain strained, but we do not expect outright hostilities.
- The budget deficit will widen as a percentage of GDP in 2020/21 (April-March), as the government will fall short on revenue income and launches stimulus to keep households and firms afloat during the lockdown. It will narrow but still remain wide during the remainder of the forecast period.
- We expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) will cut interest rates by another 75 basis points in the remainder of 2020. The RBI will also tweak its policy tools and regulatory framework to facilitate the transmission of accommodative monetary policy.
- Real GDP growth will slump to 0.3% in 2020/21, down from an estimated 4.9% in 2019/20. The recovery will be sluggish, we expect the economy to grow by an annual average of 5.8% in 2021/22-2024/25.
- The rupee is forecast to depreciate against the US dollar in 2020, averaging Rs74.8:US$1. The currency will r emain weak in 2022-24, owing to a persistent current-account deficit and rising domestic inflation.
- The trade deficit will narrow in 2020 amid low global oil prices. It will widen from 2021 as India increases imports of capital goods. Business outsourcing and information technology will remain the key service export sectors in 2020-24.

- India's score improves over the forecast period, owing to improvements in the infrastructure category, but its overall regional ranking remains weak.

Country forecast overview: India's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: The government takes steps towards partial privatisation of some state-owned companies in 2021.
2022-24: The government continues to rationalise liquidation and bankruptcy laws to simplify the closure of loss-making businesses or merger and acquisition activity involving other corporate entities.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: The government's policy towards foreign direct investment will remain ambiguous. Some firms face a lengthy approval process.
2022-24: Foreign investment in export manufacturing increases markedly, albeit in only a few regions.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: The country remains reluctant to join major regional trade deals.
2022-24: Full capital-account convertibility remains off the policy agenda.
Taxes 2020-21: Rationalisation of the goods and services tax (GST) continues, resulting in a reduction in the number of tax bands. Tax breaks and rebates are made available to businesses and individuals affected by the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak.
2022-24: Alcohol and petroleum products remain outside the scope of the GST.
Financing 2020-21: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) relaxes regulatory norms for debt-laden banks and non-bank financial companies (NBFC), raising risks to banking-sector stability but improving the funding availability for corporates.
2022-24: Private-sector banks account for a rising share of total lending, while bad debt issues persist in public-sector banks. Major consolidation and privatisations within the public-sector banks will continue.
The labour market 2020-21: Unemployment soars because of the lockdown. The government expands rural employment guarantee schemes.
2022-24: Some labour reforms make headway at state level. However, reforms at the central government level remain stuck, owing to a lack of political consensus behind the changes.
Infrastructure 2020-21: The government increases its budgetary allocation to healthcare facility projects, in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
2022-24: The construction of a high-speed rail link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad continues, but the project misses its targeted completion date of August 2022.
Technological readiness 2020-21: Most technological innovation continues to be concentrated in a few clusters, such as Bangalore. Expenditure on research and development as a proportion of GDP remains low by Asia standards.
2022-24: The government makes efforts to digitise the delivery of public services, in an effort to cut corruption and promote the efficiency of "last-mile delivery" for such services.

Background: India gained independence in 1947 after two centuries of British colonial rule. Partition at the same time created the state of Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars (two of them over the disputed territory of Kashmir). India is the second-most populous country in the world, with an estimated 1.35bn people in 2018, according to the UN. Its economy was the third-largest in the world in 2018 when measured in nominal US dollars or by purchasing power parity exchange rates.
Political structure: India has been a democracy since independence. At federal level, the Bharatiya Janata Party holds a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), although it governs in a broader coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). India follows the UK model of parliamentary government, with a prime minister as head of government. It has a president as the head of state. The country has a quasi-federal structure, with state governments having their own legislatures and enjoying a fair degree of freedom.
Policy issues: Progress on economic reform is constrained by a lack of consensus across the political spectrum over its nature and scope, and by a lack of will within the government to undertake politically risky structural reforms. The NDA administration has made headway in speeding up infrastructure projects, and this will remain a priority in the next five years. However, progress on more contentious issues, such as land and labour reforms, will be slight.
Taxation: The government will maintain efforts to broaden the tax base in 2020-24, including by further digitising tax departments. This, coupled with strong economic growth, will support a pick-up in tax collection. Despite some reforms, including the introduction of a nationwide goods and services tax in 2017, India's tax system will remain highly complex.
Foreign trade: India's trade deficit widened to US$186.7bn in 2018, from US$148.1bn in 2017, while its surplus on the services account rose from US$75.9bn to US$80.8bn.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the majority of seats in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) in the general election that took place in April-May 2019. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any threat to the BJP's domination of the central government during its term, which ends in 2024.
The results of the 2019 election were testament to the popularity of the prime minister, Narendra Modi. He will remain the dominant figure in the government. Decision-making will remain centralised among the prime minister's office (PMO) and key ministers and officials whom Mr Modi trusts, the most prominent being the national security adviser, Ajit Doval. We believe that the PMO and Mr Doval will continue to set the policy agenda until the next election. The lockdown measures, introduced on March 25th, have been welcomed by the public as an effective measure to halt the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19). Mr Modi will continue to enjoy the relatively high popularity ratings, but a prolonged bout of containment measures that lasts for months could damage his reputation. State governments have largely followed the directives of the central government, although some have opted for stricter containment measures.
Assuming that spread of the coronavirus is contained by mid-year, social unrest will pose a threat to political stability during the remainder of the forecast period. Clashes between religious groups will intensify in states with a history of communal violence, such as Uttar Pradesh and Assam. In contrast to the country's current secular constitution, several far-right groups, including some affiliated with the BJP, have long been pushing for India to be recast as a Hindu nation-a view that puts them at odds with minority groups, notably Muslims. Violent protests are continuing across India following the enactment in December of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019, with some fearing that the change will erode secularism and others concerned about unchecked immigration. State governments (which control the local police in India) will be keen to restore order quickly following any instances of communal violence, although some may not implement the changes to the citizenship law.
The security situation in the state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) will remain a key concern in 2020-21. The government's decision in August 2019 to revoke the special status accorded to the state sparked protests. Despite the deployment of large numbers of troops and the arrest of many local leaders, further unrest cannot be ruled out. We expect security risks in the area to remain high in the medium term. Any attempt by protesters to destabilise the region is likely to face a heavy-handed response from the government, including the use of internet shutdowns, curfews and riot-control forces. The government's move has also increased the risk of related terrorist attacks by separatist forces in major Indian cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch The next general election is expected to be held around May 2024. The focus before then will be on gauging support for the BJP in the state assembly elections. However, the results of recent state elections suggest that voters treat state and national elections differently, and that local issues tend to be more important. We believe that the BJP will perform poorly in the state election in Bihar later in the year.
In the Rajya Sabha (the upper house), the BJP and its allies form the largest grouping, although they command fewer than half the total number of seats. Assuming that the BJP retains control of key state assemblies and wins control of a few more in the next few years, the party and its allies within the larger National Democratic Alliance (NDA) could secure a simple majority in the upper house. This will enable the alliance to pass legislation without opposition approval. However, it will struggle to win the two-thirds majority needed to make constitutional changes unchallenged.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations Tensions with Pakistan will be exacerbated by the Indian government's move in August 2019 to revoke the special status granted to J&K. We expect relations to remain strained, but do not anticipate a complete breakdown of diplomatic ties. We believe that Pakistan's military will increase its support for militant groups in Indian-controlled Kashmir. This will raise the risk of terrorist attacks by non-state actors. Although small-scale military exchanges between the two countries are likely to occur in 2020-24, we believe that the two governments will ensure that these do not escalate into a full-blown conflict.
The US president, Donald Trump, visited India in February 2020. India and the US have affirmed further co-operation on defence policy and confirmed a military equipment purchase. However, they failed to reach even a limited trade deal, owing to disagreements on India's tariff collection and restrictions on service sector exports by the US. In general, ties will remain cordial, underpinned by a mutual desire to counter China's growing influence.
China's sway in South Asia and its close ties with Pakistan will remain a bone of contention between China and India. A decision on April 18th to subject all direct investment from China to a lengthy approval process has triggered blowback from China, although we don't expect any immediate retaliation. Despite attempts at a reset of bilateral ties in recent years, territorial disputes between China and India will persist, and relations will remain tense in 2020-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends The BJP government will enjoy considerable flexibility in determining the economic policy agenda, given its majority in the Lok Sabha. The key near-term priority for the administration is to contain the development of the coronavirus outbreak, to which India is particularly vulnerable, given its large population and weak healthcare infrastructure. The government's approach will include effectively quarantining the country (a lockdown from March 25th to May 3rd), enhancing the capacity of the healthcare system and ratifying a stimulus plan to bolster the economy. The government delivered a first stimulus-relief package targeted at low-income groups on March 26th, which included direct cash transfers and food giveaways. A fiscal relief package for businesses will also be forthcoming. Incentives will be offered to labour-intensive sectors and special allowance given to service sectors that are heavily impacted by the closure of businesses, including transportation and hospitality. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) will also extend liquidity support.
The government's broader policy agenda will be put on the back burner, at least in 2020. It is unlikely to push for radical reforms that are politically contentious, such as a comprehensive overhaul of land-acquisition laws or labour regulations. However, piecemeal changes to such legislation, such as the relaxation of certain regulatory requirements and a modest liberalisation of foreign investment, could be undertaken. Nevertheless, we expect only limited gains from this, as the Modi administration will be hesitant to push ahead with productivity-enhancing reforms that could be politically damaging. The lockdown will amplify the mounting non-performing loan (NPL) issues in the banking sector. The risk of a systemic failure of banks is not negligible.
Infrastructure projects-particularly pet projects of the Modi government, such as the National infrastructure Pipeline-remain a priority, partly in response to the rapid pace of urbanisation and partly to boost the business environment. In light of the coronavirus outbreak, healthcare facilities will become another focus of government investment.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy The coronavirus outbreak will force the government to rewrite its approved budget for 2020/21, which was conservatively expansionary. It is likely to temporarily suspend the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act to allow for more flexibility in terms of supporting the economy. The extension of the lockdown will probably prompt an unbudgeted increase in social spending programmes, especially the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, as well as an extension of existing financial support schemes for businesses. As a result, the budget deficit will widen to the equivalent of 6.1% of GDP in 2020/21.
Lockdown policies and the demands of healthcare provision mean that the government will implement relatively aggressive fiscal stimulus. Measures will include a direct cash-transfer initiative to households. Social spending will be expanded significantly amid the extended lockdown. Further plans include an infrastructure development programme and tax break for businesses. These measures will go alongside reforms included in the approved budget, such as the simplification of income tax for individuals in certain income groups and the abolition of the dividend distribution tax.
As the economy recovers, the government will look to gradually consolidate the public finances. This will lead to a narrowing of the budget deficit to the equivalent of 5.2% of GDP in 2021/22. The authorities will look to deepen the tax base and increase low levels of tax compliance. However, the need to support welfare payments and infrastructure spending will keep upward pressure on fiscal expenditure. We also expect subsidies for labour-intensive, small-scale businesses, particularly those that are export-focused, in an effort to promote exports and employment.
This federal fiscal picture does not reflect the large deficits of several state governments. The deep deficits in some states, such as Himachal Pradesh, will present implicit liabilities for the central government.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy The coronavirus epidemic will prompt further monetary policy loosening by the RBI. The central bank has lowered its policy repo rate by 75 basis points to 4.4%, as well as widened the monetary policy corridor by lowering the reverse repo rate (the "floor" of the corridor) by 115 basis points, to 3.75%. With inflationary pressures moderating and economic growth under strong near-term downward pressure, we now expect further 75-basis-points reduction in the policy repo rate during the remainder of 2020/21. We also expect the adoption of more unconventional policy instruments. This will include cuts to the reserve cash ratio, long-term refinancing operations and a moratorium, of three months initially, on all term loan repayments.
These measures aim to support businesses as the coronavirus pandemic supresses household spending and business investment. However, the outcome might be far from satisfying. The transmission from monetary policy rate to actual lending is not so smooth, as the banks are also reluctant to lend. Also, the informal sector cannot lend from normal financial institutions and, therefore, will be hard to benefit from these policies. The level of non-performing assets in the financial sector is alarming, and the coronavirus outbreak may amplify the issue, with more firms forced out of business. The government might have to recapitalise the banks through rescue mergers with public-sector banks, or even directly nationalise the stressed banks.
The RBI has maintained inflation-targeting as the cornerstone of its monetary policy framework. It seeks to contain consumer price inflation within a 2-6% range, and close to a target of 4%. However, strong political pressure on the RBI-which has forced out two hawkish heads of the bank under BJP rule-has complicated these objectives.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth The coronavirus outbreak will take a significant toll on India's economy. A near six-week long nationwide lockdown period, with factories and office buildings closed, will remove a significant proportion of economic activity. A loss of income, corporate bankruptcy and a jump in unemployment will affect household spending and business investment beyond the lockdown. Following the extension of the containment measures and the fact these were stricter than we originally envisaged, we now expect real GDP growth to slow to 0.3% in 2020/21, compared with growth of 2.1% previously. Expansion of this level would be the lowest since 1991. The economy will contract (on a year-on-year basis) in the first half of 2020/21 (April-September), before mounting a recovery in the second half of the year as the coronavirus outbreak comes under greater control and the global economy recovers.
On a GDP expenditure basis, we now expect private consumption to contract at a faster pace, as people are unable to consume as much during an extended period. Investment spending is now expected to decline at a faster pace as well. We maintain our view that the government will continue to bolster the economy through government expenditure, but the effect will be limited. We expect both exports and imports to fall as the global economy slips into recession.
Real GDP growth is expected to rebound sharply in 2o21/22, but headline forecast of 6% will be somewhat exaggerated by a low base of comparison in the April-June quarter of this year. An anticipated tightening of monetary policy in 2022-23 will also weigh on sentiment. Over the long term, progress on structural reforms will be too slow to give real GDP a significant boost.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation We expect consumer prices to increase by an average of 3.4% in 2020 as a whole, compared with 3.7% in 2019. Food price has fallen significantly in the wake of strong harvests. The coronavirus outbreak will lead to significant drop in demand, and therefore prices for services at least will fall gradually. Price pressures will recover gradually from the second half of this year, as the lack of labour during the next harvesting season weighs on overall food prices, and household demand recovers gradually. Our forecast assumes a normal monsoon this year (and in every year of the outlook period).
The RBI will keep its policy rate unchanged in 2021 to bolster the recovery. The adoption of a tighter monetary policy stance by the RBI in 2022 will offset the inflationary impact of strengthening oil prices. The central bank will accord higher priority to containing inflationary pressures towards the end of the forecast period; consumer price inflation is expected at 4.4% in 2024.
Low oil prices and low domestic demand in 2020 will cause producer price inflation to decline by 0.2% in the year. As prices for oil and other commodities strengthen, producer price inflation will firm to an average of 3.7% in 2021-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates The RBI's adoption of a fairly aggressive loosening stance in 2019, along with high political risks associated with the removal of J&K's special constitutional status and changes to the citizenship law, have weighed on the exchange rate. The coronavirus outbreak has amplified such pressures. We forecast that the rupee will depreciate by 5.9% on an annual average basis, to Rs74.8:US$1 in 2020, as investors flee to safe-haven assets and the domestic economic situation worsens.
In 2021 we expect the rupee to appreciate slightly, to an average of Rs72.7:US$1, as investor confidence returns. The rupee will depreciate in 2022-24 amid rising oil prices and persistent current-account deficit.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector The lower oil price and weaker domestic demand will contribute to a narrowing of India's current-account deficit in 2020, when it is forecast to stand at the equivalent of 0.4% of GDP. Merchandise export growth will be depressed by disruptions caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus globally in the year, but is expected to rebound in 2021 amid a pick-up in global commerce. In the longer term, India's export manufacturing sector will still be held back by restrictive labour laws and difficulties in securing land for production facilities.
Increased competition from other countries and changing industrial trends will weigh on the pace of growth in India's main service export sectors, particularly business process outsourcing and information technology (IT). Nevertheless, the services balance will remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, making a positive contribution to the current account. Owing to the large shortfall on merchandise trade, however, the current account will remain in deficit in the remainder of the forecast period.
The coronavirus outbreak will weigh on inward investment in 2020. Inward direct investment will recover in 2021-24, as the expanding economy and growing consumer demand provide opportunities for businesses.

Full text: - The unfolding economic crisis stemming from the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak will complicate policymaking for the remainder of the term of the president, Lenín Moreno, which ends in May 2021. Commitment to fiscal discipline in the face of a deteriorating macroeconomic environment will embolden political opposition to the government ahead of presidential and legislative elections in February 2021, and will raise the risk of social unrest. Irrespective of the election outcome, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects sizeable barriers to governing and to stability to persist, considering the highly fragmented political landscape. Assuming that a centrist government is elected, these headwinds will hamper piecemeal liberalising economic reforms.
- Ecuador is one of the smallest markets in our business environment rankings. The country's mineral reserves will continue to attract oil and mining investors, but the domestic market will grow only slightly as it struggles to recover from the recession engendered by the coronavirus outbreak. We forecast that GDP per head (at market exchange rates) will rise only marginally in 2021-24, after falling by about 7% in 2020, but will remain below its 2019 level of $6,206. As such, business opportunities will remain restricted by low purchasing power, as well as by a small market size.
- Under the auspices of the IMF, the government will cut public spending and investment to shore up the public finances. Despite a statistical rebound in real GDP in 2021, the country's short-term growth prospects will be curbed by soft oil prices, which will also weigh on the fiscal and external accounts. Notwithstanding political and economic uncertainties, we expect dollarisation to be maintained in the 2020-24 forecast period, as it remains popular for delivering macroeconomic stability and for taming inflation.
- Population growth is slowing, owing to a falling birth rate and continued emigration (albeit at lower levels). However, at an annual average of 1.3% per year in 2020-24, population growth will be on a par with that of neighbouring Andean nations. The unemployment rate will average 5% in 2020-24 but underemployment will remain high. The informal sector will remain substantial, partly owing to labour market rigidities. Although low levels of productivity and a wealth of natural resources offer scope for Ecuador to catch up with more developed countries, poor prospects for institutional improvements are likely to preclude a stable economic policy direction. We forecast that income will continue to lag OECD levels in the long term.

- Ecuador scores poorly in our business environment rankings, owing to its dependence on oil and the current administration's timid embrace of orthodox policymaking. Although the country's score improves slightly in the forecast period, its global ranking remains low. The government will seek more private investment, but structural shortcomings in the investment environment will not be fully addressed, hindering investors' perceptions.

Country forecast overview: Ecuador's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: Fuel subsidies are gradually, albeit not completely, rolled back in targeted manner. Implementation of antitrust policies is subject to politicisation. Select industries (such as mining) benefit from policies promoting supply-side growth.
2022-24: Government continues to scale back state's role in development. Nonetheless, regulation and licensing continue to favour state-run companies over private-sector firms. A new public-private partnership model is trialled.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Overtures to foreign firms and pro-business reforms partly offset the government's continual interventionism.
2022-24: Inadequate property-rights protection and questions regarding access to foreign arbitration deter investment. New mining projects attract investment.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: Government maintains capital outflows tax and increases import tariffs to protect dollarisation.
2022-24: Supply-side reforms enhance national competitiveness and government begins to phase out capital outflows tax.
Taxes 2020-21: Government implements tax reform to expand tax base and improve collection. Certain exemptions will be eliminated, while other burdensome regulations are simplified.
2022-24: Efforts continue to increase tax collection, supporting revenue growth. Tax system remains complex.
Financing 2020-21: Deposit and credit growth are moderate and support banking stability.
2022-24: Financing is still below potential as public-financing needs curb growth of long-term lending to private sector.
The labour market 2020-21: Government takes steps to reduce public-wage bill and reduce labour market rigidities.
2022-24: Quality of workforce remains poor. Labour reforms are slow to take effect.
Infrastructure 2020-21: Fiscal constraints lead to cancellation of several projects. Efforts to drum up large-scale foreign investment achieve little success.
2022-24: Renewed interest in port and airport development sustains new cycle of investment.
Technological readiness 2020-21: Investment to expand fourth-generation (4G) broadband availability.
2022-24: Increasing adoption of civic technologies by government. Fifth-generation (5G) technology remains in its infancy.

Background: Ecuador restored its presidential democracy in 1979, but its institutions remain fragile. External economic shocks have contributed to the ousting of three presidents by popular protest since 1997. The current president, Lenín Moreno, took office in May 2017, succeeding Rafael Correa (2007-17)-the longest-serving president in Ecuadorean history. In February 2018 a series of constitutional reforms introduced by Mr Moreno (including the reintroduction of a two-term limit for the presidency) were approved by referendum. Although this was a step towards deeper democratisation, persistent social and fiscal challenges will continue to weigh on governability.
Political structure: The 2008 constitution increased executive power, but has done little to foster institutional capacity to tackle problems such as a politicised judiciary, powerful business lobbies, and mobilised grassroots and indigenous groups. The political system is fragmented. Mr Moreno retains strong executive powers, but his Alianza País lost considerable standing after the results of the 2018 referendum splintered the party.
Policy issues: Dollarisation has provided macroeconomic stability but exposed Ecuador's underlying lack of competitiveness. Modest oil prices during the 2020-24 forecast period, relative to the previous decade, have necessitated fiscal adjustments. A three-year IMF agreement (along with other multilateral financing), secured by the Moreno administration in March 2019 after borrowing in international capital markets became unsustainable, will be leveraged to address these shortcomings. The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic will complicate the government's economic reform agenda, especially considering its lack of fiscal space to counter the hit to the economy and financial system.
Taxation: Taxes have been subject to frequent changes. The main taxes in Ecuador are income tax, levied at rates of up to 35%, and value-added tax (VAT), levied at 12%. Private firms must distribute 15% of their profits among their employees.
Foreign trade: Ecuador recorded an estimated trade surplus of US$1bn in 2019. Weak external demand is likely to preclude a trade surplus in 2020, before an expansion of earnings from oil, banana and shrimp exports support trade surpluses in 2021-24.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic presents the president, Lenín Moreno, with two immense challenges before his term ends in May 2021. First, Mr Moreno must work to contain the spread of the virus with limited resources. Strict national lockdown measures have been in place since mid-March, but have largely been unsuccessful; the virus has spread rapidly, with more than 22,160 cases reported as at April 24th (double the amount reported on April 23rd). Although there is consensus for thorough containment measures and an eventual gradual easing of restrictions, policymaking will be challenging as the crisis deepens; the political landscape is highly fragmented, Mr Moreno lacks a majority-his Alianza País (AP) has 42 seats, 27 short of the threshold-and the February 2021 elections are approaching. The second challenge for the president is to stabilise the economy as oil prices languish, lockdown measures stifle activity and external demand shrinks. With no fiscal space to mount a countercyclical response (Mr Moreno has announced cuts to public spending and submitted tax-raising legislation), the opposition will be emboldened, political instability aggravated and the risk of unrest heightened significantly.
A daily curfew from 2pm to 5am is in effect until early May, although this will be heterogeneous across the country, with an easing of measures directed by mayors of cantons. However, with the economic situation for millions of Ecuadoreans quickly worsening, there is a high probability for protests to occur in the next few months, especially considering that indigenous groups responsible for intense protests in October 2019 have called for a permanent mobilisation against the government.
Commitment to socially unpalatable and politically divisive economic measures will help the government to retain IMF support, but will dissolve support for the president. Mr Moreno has staked his presidency on his economic programme backed by a three-year, US$4.2bn extended fund facility (EFF) with the IMF, and US$6bn in additional multilateral financing (intended to be disbursed between March 2019 and December 2021). On March 23rd, amid the coronavirus outbreak, the administration made Ecuador's second-ever bond repayment. In doing so, the president snubbed a nearly unanimous request from the legislature that external debt payments be suspended, reflecting the governability challenges that the administration faces as it seeks a successor programme to its current IMF arrangement and attempts to advance several reforms to shore up the public finances amid an economic crisis.
Political jockeying will be a constant undercurrent as elections near. Political leaders from across the ideological spectrum will seek to capitalise on the economic crisis and elevate their position. Radical leftist ideals supported by the former president, Rafael Correa (2007-17), may return to the fore as the economy deteriorates, despite the fact that Mr Correa was sentenced in absentia to serve eight years in prison in early April. Although it is unlikely that his supporters will re-emerge as the dominant political force, political uncertainties will prevail (rather than dissipate) in the short to medium term, as the economy contracts.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch The next general election is scheduled for February 2021. We currently assume that the president will serve out the rest of his term. An early termination of Mr Moreno's term (either through his resignation or elections being brought forward) would intensify economic uncertainties and throw the country into political turmoil-outcomes that most parties are keen to avoid. Nevertheless, the presidential election result is nebulous at this stage, owing to obscurity caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
Mr Moreno has signalled that he does not intend to run and, given his government's commitment to unpopular economic measures, it is unlikely that a member of his centre-left AP will secure victory. However, the vice-president, Otto Sonnenholzner, may rise in stature owing to his visibility amid the pandemic. The conservative opposition Partido Social Cristiano (PSC) performed well in municipal elections in March 2019, and is strongly placed to capitalise on the fragmented political landscape and mount a robust campaign. The other major conservative opposition party, Creando Oportunidades led by Guillermo Lasso (who narrowly lost to Mr Moreno in 2017), also may grow in appeal. A candidate backed by Mr Correa could play a significant role in the election, as the government struggles to weather the worsening economic situation. However, even though a Correa-backed candidate may make it to the second round, we believe that Mr Sonnenholzner, a PSC candidate or Mr Lasso are more likely to win. We would expect these administrations to pursue broadly centrist economic policies, and we have based our medium-term forecasts on this assumption.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations The foreign policy agenda of Mr Moreno will remain focused on strengthening diplomatic and commercial ties with major trading partners, mainly the US (Ecuador's largest trading partner). In the short term, the coronavirus pandemic and Ecuador's unfolding economic crisis will overshadow free-trade agreement (FTA) discussions with the US (talks were scheduled to take place in April) and Ecuador's accession to the Pacific Alliance (a regional trade bloc). The latter may also be hindered by the absence of an existing bilateral agreement with Mexico; however, Ecuador and Mexico have ambitiously set February 7th 2021 (the date of general election in Ecuador) as the deadline for an FTA. There is a reasonable chance that Ecuador will enter the bloc by 2024, considering that the presidents within the Pacific Alliance (as well as Mexico's foreign minister) have expressed their support for Ecuador's swift accession to the group. However, the coronavirus pandemic or changes in government and policy direction may yet hinder the accession process.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends The coronavirus outbreak will push Ecuador closer to default and a balance-of-payments crisis. Avoiding this will require, more than ever, the support of the IMF (and other actors), but meeting the conditions required to access these funds will be extremely complicated politically, heightening risks in the coming months. Political pressure to loosen fiscal policy and suspend external debt payments is mounting, and will continue to rise, but Mr Moreno will try to maintain fiscal discipline and work to improve the country's credibility with investors, most likely seeking an amicable restructuring of its debt with private creditors, rather than trigger a disorderly default.
Mr Moreno's stance will help to unlock much-needed financial assistance from multilateral development banks and the IMF. The government has requested a US$500m loan through the Fund's Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) by end-April, which the IMF is considering. Unlike fully fledged IMF programmes, RFIs come with little conditionality, and this should provide the government with some policy leeway considering the circumstances, assuming that the request is approved (we have pencilled the funds into our forecasts). That said, we do not expect a dramatic loosening of policy either, as the government will be hoping that its show of credibility will help it to secure at least US$1bn from China by end-May (which we have also pencilled into our forecasts). New external financing and close collaboration between the government and the IMF will be paramount to navigating the developing crisis in the coming weeks and months, as the government is working to establish a new arrangement with the Fund that builds on the current EFF.
The objectives of the government's IMF-backed economic programme will be overshadowed by the policy response to the economic and health crises. We expect that the government will still pursue labour reform and the removal of fuel subsidies, having stated before the crisis that a gradual and less drastic fuel subsidy reduction would be rolled out by June, but short-term measures to boost health expenditure and to provide support to the economy will take precedence for now.
Assuming that a centre-right or centre-left government takes office in May 2021 (before the final EFF review in December of that year) and provides for policy continuity, we expect that the four primary objectives of the EFF will continue to be prioritised in the medium to long term. These include improving competitiveness, tackling fiscal imbalances, protecting the poor and fighting corruption. Moreover, under our political assumptions and in the light of the unfolding crises, we view IMF assistance beyond 2021 as a highly probable scenario. This suggests a piecemeal advancement of business-friendly policies and complementary reforms in 2021-24. Nonetheless, limited progress will be made in diversifying the economy away from oil (the country left OPEC in January to free itself from quotas).
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy The government will have limited success in cushioning the blow to the fiscal accounts from the drastic halt to domestic economic activity and lower oil revenue than previously anticipated in the budget. We thus expect both a widening of the fiscal deficit and a cut in public expenditure, although there are sizeable political risks to the latter in particular. Even assuming that new, extraordinary multilateral and bilateral assistance is forthcoming, this will not be enough to plug the fiscal hole produced by the collapse in oil prices.
On the expenditure side, the government plans to accelerate the downsizing of the state and to reduce spending by US$1.4bn in 2020 to help to offset the fall in revenue from oil sales. Of the US$1.4bn reduction (equivalent to about 1.3% of GDP), US$845m will come from lower spending on goods and services, while US$535m will stem from lower capital expenditure. On the revenue side, the government has submitted legislation to create a "humanitarian assistance fund" totalling nearly US$1bn, which will be financed by progressive contributions of workers who make more than US$500 per month (paid over nine months), and by a contribution of 5% of the profits of companies with profits greater than US$1m (paid over three months). The government's estimated US$2.3bn in fiscal savings is likely to be overly optimistic, considering the government's struggle to dial back spending in recent months and the National Assembly's opposition to increased taxes amid an economic crisis.
On balance, we forecast that the non-financial public-sector (NFPS) deficit will widen to 4.7% of GDP in 2020, assuming that public spending is cut by much less compared with revenue. Public debt as a percentage of GDP will rise from an estimated 45.3% of GDP in 2019 to 52.7% in 2020. The fiscal targets set in the government's EFF are unfeasible-the pace of fiscal adjustment was already slowed at end-2019 in a combined second and third review of the EFF and the fourth review was suspended-and we view as impossible both an improvement of 4 percentage points in the non-oil primary balance/GDP ratio (including subsidies) from 2019 to 2021, and a reduction in the public debt/GDP ratio to 40% by 2024.
The successor IMF agreement being negotiated will shed light on how fiscal targets and fiscal policymaking adapt to the looming economic recession. Irrespective of the changes, programme implementation risks will be glaringly high, as social and political challenges to reforms exceed their pre-crisis levels. Without details on a new deal, and assuming policy continuity, we expect the NFPS deficit to gradually narrow in 2021-24, to about 2% of GDP by 2024, and for the public debt/GDP ratio to stabilise at about 57%. We are cautiously optimistic that that the government will avoid a disorderly default, owing to bilateral and multilateral financing-the government estimates that it will receive about US$2bn from multilateral creditors and China-and prudent debt-management operations. Following a final US$325m payment on the capital of a 10.5%, five-year bond in mid-March, the government successfully launched a consent solicitation in mid-April to defer US$811m in interest payments until August, as its response to the coronavirus outbreak saps its resources. Although it is not yet our baseline forecast, there is a substantial risk that Ecuador will be forced into a debt restructuring this year, or fall into disorderly default ahead of larger payments in the second half of 2020.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy As a dollarised economy, Ecuador lacks independent monetary policy and will not be able to foment a monetary policy response to the emerging economic crisis. Monetary conditions will continue to be largely determined by external factors, but real local rates will remain elevated, owing to Ecuador's high risk premium. Monetary growth will hinge on foreign-exchange inflows, as well as the confidence of domestic lenders, both of which will be markedly undermined by the rapid deterioration of the economy. The threat of de-dollarisation will sustain the risk of capital flight, which raises the risk that preventative measures in the short term are implemented in order to protect domestic liquidity levels.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth We expect real GDP to contract by 6.5% in 2020. Net exports are still likely to contribute positively to growth, despite a marked drop in export volumes; we expect them to decrease by 9.3% as external demand falls markedly, but this drop will be overshadowed by a 16.7% decline in import volumes. The sizeable decline in import volumes reflects a significant deterioration in domestic demand.
Low oil receipts will lead to a retrenchment in government consumption, indirectly feeding through to private consumption, which will be constrained by a worsening labour market. Economic and political uncertainties will weigh on private investment, which will decline for a second consecutive year. Assuming that the coronavirus outbreak is controlled by end-2020-prompting a recovery in external and domestic demand-we expect real GDP growth to rebound in 2021, but it will remain below 2019 levels.
Political uncertainties will be elevated by the February 2021 general election and this will preclude a more robust pick-up in domestic demand. We expect growth to be tepid in 2022, considering the 2021 rebound, but it should slowly improve thereafter as policy uncertainties wane, oil prices rise and moderate improvements to the business environment materialise.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation Tumbling commodity prices, weak demand and a strengthening US dollar will produce deflation this year. Consumer prices were flat in 2019, and we expect them to fall by an average of 0.3% this year. We expect inflation to pick up slightly, to an annual average of 0.9% in 2021-24, as import costs rise owing to renewed dollar weakness and an increase in commodity prices. Dollarisation will help to contain inflation, but the economy will remain vulnerable to increases in food and energy prices.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates Risks to dollarisation have risen and remain elevated in the short term. The economic crisis presents major problems of financing and liquidity, as oil prices have crashed and access to global financing remains limited. These problems are likely to be compounded by a short-term strengthening of the US dollar (hurting competitiveness) and a dip in reserves.
Nevertheless, we currently assume that dollarisation will be retained in 2020-24, as the government's commitment to its IMF agreement and to fiscal discipline allows for greater multilateral financing. The real effective exchange rate will remain stronger than its long-term, pre-dollarisation average but, in real trade-weighted terms, there will be some depreciation as the US dollar begins to weaken in 2021-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector The current-account deficit will widen in 2020, as the macroeconomic backdrop deteriorates. Diminishing oil revenue will weigh significantly on the trade balance in the short term, as oil prices languish and external demand withers. Non-oil export earnings will be hit hard, with shrimp and mining exports in particular suffering from domestic restrictions on business operations to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and a retraction of demand in major export markets, including China and the US. Deterioration of the trade balance will be softened by collapsing domestic demand, which will engender import compression. However, remittances are also likely to suffer as economic activity has ground to a halt outside Ecuador, dragging down the current-account deficit. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows will pick up in the medium term after suffering in 2020-21, which will preclude a build up in foreign-exchange reserves, but will remain below 1% of GDP.

Full text: - The re-election of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president, in June 2018 concluded Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Mr Erdogan and his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) to stay in power until 2023 (the next presidential and parliamentary elections), as he will maintain a tight grip on national institutions and the media in order to continue to dominate Turkish politics. However, the loss of mayoral elections in Ankara, the capital, and Istanbul, the commercial capital, in 2019 dealt a heavy blow to the credibility of the president and his party. The coronavirus outbreak in March 2020 could also be destabilising as Mr Erdogan and the AKP struggle to contain the spread of the pandemic.
- Turkey's foreign policy priorities have shifted under the AKP since the early 2000s. Declining trust in the US and the EU, a gradual shift to a multipolar world and an ambition to make Turkey a regional power have all incentivised the AKP to pursue a "Turkey first" approach to foreign policy. Turkey and Russia entered an alliance of convenience following an attempted coup in July 2016. However, relations are under strain over escalating violence in the province of Idlib in north-western Syria, where the two countries back opposing sides.
- We expect the AKP to continue its policy of favouring credit-driven economic growth in lieu of economic rebalancing. Following a recession in 2018 the economy started to recover in 2019, but we expect the coronavirus outbreak and the measures adopted to contain it to disrupt the recovery in 2020 and to weigh heavily on Turkey's public finances. We expect the deficit to widen from 2.9% of GDP in 2019 to 4.5% of GDP in 2020, before narrowing gradually to a still-large 3% of GDP in 2024. Following a real GDP contraction of 3.5% in 2020 we expect the economy to recover gradually, averaging growth of 3.5% per year in 2021-24-well short of the government's annual 5% target.
- Turkey's heavy reliance on often volatile, short-term capital inflows to fund lending and drive economic growth leaves the economy vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. However, the country's location and its large consumer market make Turkey an attractive place to do business. The population is young, growing and inclined to consume rather than save. GDP per head (at market exchange rates) is expected to fall to about US$8,000 in 2020, before recovering during the remainder of the forecast period (2020-24), reaching about US$12,500 in 2024.

- Our business environment score for Turkey deteriorates slightly in the forecast period, but the country's global ranking has fallen by 12 places, to 56th. Political tensions, increased powers concentrated under the president, inadequate policy responses to tighter global liquidity conditions and high domestic inflation have raised the level of uncertainty about the direction of economic policy.

Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: Political instability and adverse market conditions, both of which have been exacerbated by the coronavirus outbreak, will delay further privatisation deals.
2022-24: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but macroeconomic instability and concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2022-24: Further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors could boost FDI inflows.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: Political tensions with the US will result in further US sanctions and disrupt Turkish-US trade and relations.
2022-24: Negotiations with the EU to update the customs union are likely to be protracted, given poor Turkish-EU relations.
Taxes 2020-21: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Tax rises introduced in 2018 to curb the widening of the budget deficit reduce company profits.
2022-24: Income-tax base becomes broader as exemptions and exceptions are reduced, but evasion remains widespread.
Financing 2020-21: The Central Bank of Turkey will lower interest rates further, despite still relatively high inflation. State banks continue to extend credit to non-financial corporates and households to support economic growth, but bad loans rise sharply.
2022-24: Lending growth to pick up as banking system regains strength and non-performing loan ratio falls. Continued reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market 2020-21: Relatively high labour costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment.
2022-24: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure 2020-21: First phase of third airport in Istanbul becomes operational. Slower progress made on other projects.
2022-24: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks might persist.
Technological readiness 2020-21: Spending on research and development remains moderate, at about 1% of GDP, holding back efforts to move the economy up the value-added ladder.
2022-24: Turkey's young population spurs further rapid digital transformation of the banking sector.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe in 1949 and NATO in 1952, and signed an association agreement with the then European Community in 1963. A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but a coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey currently has a presidential system of government, with parliament elected for a five-year term. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup, power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the AKP leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. Following his re-election, the presidential system of government was established and the post of prime minister was abolished.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability and stabilising the lira following the August 2018 currency crisis and the outbreak of the coronavirus in March 2020 are Turkey's biggest policy challenges. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but discipline has gradually eroded in recent years. Turkey's large external financing needs require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy tight to attract adequate capital inflows, especially in periods of risk aversion, but the central bank is under political pressure to lower interest rates, creating uncertainty about the direction of economic policy. The Kurdish issue, which has blocked economic development in the south-east of the country, is one of Turkey's most pressing policy challenges, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015, leading to a resurgence of violence. Politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The corporation tax rate was raised from 20% to 22% in 2018. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Reducing tax evasion was one of the elements of previous IMF-led reform programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2019 goods exports totalled about US$182bn and imports about US$199bn, reducing Turkey's trade deficit to just US$16.6bn, helping to generate a rare current-account surplus of US$8bn (or 1.1% of GDP).

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president, and his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) have dominated Turkey's political scene since coming to power in November 2002. During this period they have tightened their grip on authority by replacing Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidential system that has concentrated control in the hands of Mr Erdogan and by clamping down on all forms of political opposition. Mr Erdogan and the AKP suffered a clear blow to their credibility when an opposition candidate, Ekrem Imamoglu, increased his margin of victory over Binali Yildirim of the ruling coalition in the mayoral election rerun in Istanbul (Turkey's largest city) in June 2019. The spread of the coronavirus to Turkey since March 2020 is likely to be politically destabilising as Mr Erdogan and the AKP struggle to contain the outbreak. However, we expect the president to maintain his tight grip on national institutions and the media in order to continue his dominance of Turkish politics. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the AKP and Mr Erdogan, who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup in July 2016, to remain in power until 2023 (the next presidential and parlia-mentary elections).
The economy has become less stable in recent years as a result of domestic political tensions, fraught international relations and unorthodox economic policies. This has jeopardised the hard-won improvements in macroeconomic stability on which the AKP built much of its electoral success in the early years of its dominance. The coronavirus outbreak has become a further source of economic instability, as we expect that the pandemic and the measures adopted to contain it will reverse the fragile economic recovery that got under way in 2019 after the 2018 currency crisis and will result in a sharp deterioration in Turkey's public finances.
Security risk remains high, as Turkey appears vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Neither the government nor the PKK are interested in reviving peace negotiations, which collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will return to the levels seen in the 1990s. The fact that the ruling coalition is made up of the AKP and the Nationalist Action Party (MHP) will hinder attempts to resolve the Kurdish issue, as the MHP is pushing for hawkish policies aimed at constraining and delegitimising the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP).
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch Mr Erdogan was re-elected as president in June 2018, securing 52.6% of the vote on a turnout of 86.2%. In the parliamentary election the AKP lost its absolute majority-although it secured a coalition majority with the MHP-as the HDP managed to win more than the 10% threshold needed to enter parliament. The election process appeared to be mostly free, but largely unfair: opposition candidates received little or no media coverage and the government restrained freedom of speech and association.
Local elections took place in March 2019. The AKP and the MHP retained a majority of the national vote. However, the ruling parties lost vital cities such as Ankara, the capital, and Istanbul. Given the public resources that major cities command, Mr Erdogan and the AKP put huge pressure on the Supreme Election Council (YSK) to annul the Istanbul election result. The YSK ordered an election rerun in June 2019, but the opposition candidate still won, and by a larger margin, probably reflecting discontent over Mr Erdogan's tactics.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations An increasingly multipolar world, national security threats, Turkey's suspicion of its traditional Western allies since the attempted coup in July 2016 and the government's ambition to establish the country as a regional power have all contributed to a shift in foreign policy approach. This shift has led to Turkey adopting a more assertive stance with the US and the EU, and establishing closer relations with countries with which it previously had rivalries or limited ties, such as Russia and China. Following the outbreak of the coronavirus, much of Mr Erdogan's energy will be focused on domestic affairs for some time, but the government may be tempted to use foreign policy for domestic political consumption, as it has done in the past, if it struggles to control the spread of the pandemic in Turkey.
Turkey and Russia entered an alliance of convenience following the failed coup of 2016, but relations are under strain over escalating violence in Syria, where they back opposite sides. Mr Erdogan's attempt to create a buffer zone for Syrian refugees in the Syrian-Turkish border region backfired following the latest campaign by Bashar Al-Assad, the Syrian president, to retake control of Idlib province-the last stronghold of Turkish-backed rebels. Following the death of 57 Turkish soldiers in February alone, Turkey launched an aggressive campaign against Syrian forces, which has been tolerated by Russia to some degree. However, Turkey risks being drawn into an all-out war, as Mr Assad is showing no signs of restraint. In the light of the escalating violence, Turkey has formally asked the US to supply its Patriot missile-defence system to protect Turkey's troops against the Syrian regime's forces. However, such support is unlikely to be forthcoming unless Turkey agrees to abandon deployment of the Russian S-400 missile-defence platform purchased in 2019, which poses a security threat to US aircraft and is unsuitable for Turkey's security needs in Syria. Mr Erdogan's pivot towards Russia, which called into question Turkey's NATO membership, has backfired and will result in Turkey becoming increasingly isolated in 2020-24. Furthermore, Turkish-US relations will remain tense, and the main trigger for a further deterioration in relations in 2020 will be the likelihood of the US imposing sanctions on Turkey for its purchase of the S-400 system.
Relations with the EU are also unlikely to improve in 2020-24. The main area of tension will be Turkey's recent decision to open its border with Greece and encourage thousands of refugees to try to enter the EU. The move has called into question the Turkey-EU migration agreement of 2016. Even before the coronavirus outbreak, EU members were unwilling to open their borders to refugees, fearing a repeat of the 2015 migration crisis. The EU's external borders are now closed, but individual members are likely to offer Turkey more financial assistance to deal with the mostly Syrian refugees domestically. Nonetheless, Mr Erdogan's unilateral decision to open Turkey's border has significantly increased mistrust on the EU side, which does not bode well for EU-Turkey bilateral relations over our forecast period.
Oil and gas exploration by Turkey and the Republic of Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean also has the potential to further damage relations. The EU has admonished Turkey for its "unauthorised" and "illegal" drilling activities in disputed waters in the eastern Mediterranean as a violation of Cyprus's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Turkey has long disputed Cyprus's claim to some areas of the EEZ, arguing that they lie inside its continental shelf. Turkish maritime operations are unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends The government's past focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. The AKP government will continue to favour economic policies aimed at reviving fast, credit-fuelled economic growth in the years leading up to the parliamentary and presidential elections in 2023. The economy remains weak and-following its poor performance in local elections-the AKP will continue to feel pressure to support growth and the labour market. However, the coronavirus outbreak in Turkey and the measures adopted to contain it have derailed the government's 2020-22 medium-term economic programme that was announced in September 2019. The programme forecasts included annual growth of 5% in 2020-22 and an average central government budget deficit of 2.8% of GDP. We expect a severe recession in 2020 to weigh heavily on Turkey's public finances and the ability of the public and private sectors to meet their borrowing requirements.
Shortcomings such as cronyism and corruption, skills mismatches, and tax evasion are unlikely to be addressed effectively in the forecast period. Politicisation of the Central Bank of Turkey's monetary policy is also likely to continue, given Mr Erdogan's insistence on the need for lower interest rates to support credit growth rather than curb inflation. We expect these issues to weigh on investor sentiment over medium term, especially at times of increased risk aversion. In such conditions, there is a considerable risk that attracting capital inflows to fund lending could become unsustainable, resulting in a sudden credit stop and another crisis.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy Under the AKP, public finances have been one of the economy's most reassuring aspects, but this credibility is now weakening. The budget deficit widened from an average of 1.4% of GDP in 2014-18 to 2.9% in 2019 on the back of a substantial fiscal stimulus. Based on our assessment of the measures adopted in response to the coronavirus outbreak-including a stimulus package worth TL100bn (US$14.7bn; 2% of GDP), about half of which comprises loan guarantees-we expect the deficit to widen further, to 4.5% of GDP in 2020. It will then narrow gradually, to 3% of GDP in 2024, as the economy recovers and public spending is reined in to reverse an increase in the public debt/GDP ratio to 35.7% of GDP this year. We expect government debt to have eased to 32.6% by the end of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy Since dramatically raising its main policy rate-the one-week repurchase (repo) lending rate-to 24% in September 2018 in a belated response to a sharp depreciation of the lira against all major currencies and a surge in inflation, the central bank has steadily loosened domestic monetary conditions, helped by loosening by major central banks. Since July 2019 the central bank has slashed its main policy rate by a total of 1,425 basis points, to 9.75% in mid-March 2020. This dovish turn reflects pressure from Mr Erdogan for lower interest rates, but also a partial recovery of the Turkish currency and an easing of inflationary pressure-although the average annual rate of consumer inflation was still high, at about 12% in the first quarter of 2020.
The central bank's official mandate is to reduce inflation permanently to 5% or less in the medium term. However, the focus of the central bank and the government appears to be supporting economic activity, including by stimulating credit growth, especially through lending by Turkey's state banks. With the main policy rate now below the current rate of inflation, the central bank has limited scope to cut rates without running the risk of fuelling another currency crisis, especially amid the recent financial market volatility triggered by the global spread of the coronavirus. Nevertheless, we expect central bank to cut its main policy rate gradually by a further 75 basis points, to 9% by end-2020, in order to support the economy. This forecast implies that the real policy rate will remain in negative territory during most of the forecast period, keeping the lira under pressure and causing the central bank continue to overshoot its inflation target of 5%.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth The depreciation of the Turkish lira by about 40% against the US dollar in January-August 2018 caused inflation to surge, increasing input costs for corporates and raising the debt-servicing costs of large foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. The resulting crisis pushed the Turkish economy into recession in the second half of 2018, followed by modest growth in 2019 driven by a rapid decline in interest rates. Following the outbreak of the coronavirus, we now expect the recovery to be reversed, with real GDP forecast to contract by 3.5% in 2020 as strong growth in the first quarter is offset by sharp falls in activity in the remaining three quarters of the year. This reflects weak household demand as unemployment rises and fixed investment declines further, as well as a heavy hit to exports of goods and services. Despite lira weakness, we expect the impact of supply chain disruptions, quarantine measures and travel restrictions in major markets to hurt major Turkish export industries such as the automotive sector and tourism. Automotive exports account for about 17% of the total value of goods exports and tourism accounts for about 12% of GDP (including indirect effects). We expect a gradual recovery from 2021, with GDP expanding by an average of 3.5% in 2021-24, above the potential rate of growth.
The recovery will be driven by population and employment growth, rising real wages and government-fuelled credit growth, and a pick-up in capital invest-ment and tourist inflows. With the government consistently pushing economic growth above potential, there is the risk of another significant loss of investor confidence at some point in 2021-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation Annual inflation averaged 8.5% in 2004-17, but reached 24.9% in October 2018 in the wake of the sharp lira depreciation. By October 2019 the inflation rate settled back to 8.3%, reflecting a more stable currency and subdued domestic demand. Owing largely to base effects, a return to growth in the economy and renewed lira weakness, inflation has edged up again since late 2019: inflation stood at 12% year on year (seasonally adjusted) in March 2020, marginally below 12.5% in the previous month. We expect the annual rate of inflation to undulate around this level over the next few months and to decline only moderately later in the year. The slump in global oil prices in January-March will be positive for domestic fuel and energy costs. However, we expect this to be largely offset by the impact of a renewed fall in the external value of the lira since the start of this year, resulting in an annual rate of inflation of 10.9% at end-2020. In 2021-24 we expect inflation to average 10.6% per year, with a spike up to a forecast 12% in 2022 reflecting a sharp rise in global oil prices as the post-coronavirus global economic recovery gathers pace.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates Having depreciated against the US dollar by 24.4% on average in 2018 and 14.9% in 2019 as a result of the currency crisis, the Turkish lira remained broadly stable in the second half of last year before resuming a generally weakening trajectory in the first three months of 2020. We expect lira volatility to continue in the remainder of this year, leading to a nominal depreciation of almost 16%-to TL6.74:US$1 on average and about TL7:US$1 at the end of the year-owing to negative real interest rates, a widening fiscal and current-account deficit, continued credit expansion, and the central bank's dovish monetary policy stance. From 2021 we expect the lira to remain broadly stable in nominal terms, but to appreciate moderately in real effective terms as the economy recovers. There are considerable downside risks to this currency forecast, given the increase in risk aversion amid the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector Turkey usually runs a substantial current-account deficit, financed by net inflows of capital from abroad. Since the sharp depreciation of the lira in mid-2018, however, capital inflows have been weak. Conversely, the current-account balance improved dramatically in 2019, posting a surplus of 1.1% of GDP, as the trade deficit narrowed in line with the weak lira and the economic slowdown while the surplus on the services balance (the second most important component) widened, reflecting a strong tourism season. We expect the current account to swing back into deficit, averaging 2.8% of GDP per year in 2020-21, as the hit to exports of goods and services from the coronavirus pandemic more than offsets a fall in imported energy costs resulting from lower global oil prices. In 2022-24 we expect the deficit to average 3.2% of GDP per year as recovering domestic demand and higher global oil prices offset stronger export growth.

Full text: - Despite Venezuela's socioeconomic collapse and the looming public health crisis triggered by the spread of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19), The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, will retain power throughout the 2020-24 forecast period. Mr Maduro's position will be supported primarily by his grip over a complex security apparatus and the opposition's lack of de facto power. On this basis, we expect continued deterioration of the economy, sustained outward migration, and a poorer and more violent Venezuela. Despite US sanctions (and their impact on oil production), the Maduro regime has managed internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through its strict control over the security forces.
- The scale of the socioeconomic collapse and the elevated level of political instability will ensure that the Maduro regime continues to be challenged economically and politically. The collapse in international crude prices in March, combined with US sanctions on the regime, means that barrels are currently being sold at a loss. We therefore project a reduction in domestic crude production over the coming quarters. Moreover, given that it will lose control of the legislature in 2021, the opposition will be under strong pressure in 2020 to step up its efforts to oust the regime. Mr Maduro will continue to face challenges to maintain the current patronage system and remain in control.
- De facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding. Concurrently, the government has taken measures that have allowed the official exchange rate to float. These measures have so far aided price stability and therefore increase the availability of some basic goods. However, the measures are not a product of economic orthodoxy, but of policy decisions to ensure the regime's survival. We do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that will be required to resolve the economic crisis within the forecast period.

- Venezuela is ranked 82nd of 82 countries globally in the business environment rankings for 2020-24, having been 80th in the 2015-19 historical period, as the economic crisis deepens despite minor improvements. Reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment are unlikely.

Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: Limited rollback of interventionist measures, such as price controls. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition.
2022-24: Contract rights remain subdued, and red tape and ad hoc interventionism continue.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Most attempts to attract investment prove unsuccessful, owing to political instability.
2022-24: Actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights deteriorate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: Currency controls are made less opaque, but restrictions remain on private-sector access to foreign currency.
2022-24: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves, albeit slowly.
Taxes 2020-21: Risk of further unrest and political instability reduces probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major rise in public spending.
2022-24: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2020-21: Inflation remains high, and concerns surrounding economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2022-24: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2020-21: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Past emigration of skilled labour creates skills shortages.
2022-24: Labour-market rigidities persist, despite some increase in flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2020-21: Underinvestment in water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts.
2022-24: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but risk of water and electricity rationing remains.
Technological readiness 2020-21: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment.
2022-24: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013 proved unsuccessful. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his own popularity plummet as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices, combined with strict sanctions on trade from the US, has plunged the country into a severe economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature to be in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports, and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$20.9bn in 2018 as the destruction of domestic supply led to increasing import dependence. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates the 2018 current-account surplus at 3.6% of GDP.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit considers that the spread of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) and the collapse of international crude prices present the greatest challenges to date to the survival of the military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV). These simultaneous crises have shattered the relative stability that had developed in recent months. With the onset of the crises, shrinking oil revenue will add significant pressure to the regime's finances. Hyperinflation and bolívar depreciation will worsen, with shortages of food and fuel making a comeback. In addition, owing to the bleak state of the country's healthcare system, Venezuela faces an uphill battle against the coronavirus, and there is a high risk that the ongoing socioeconomic crisis will evolve into a humanitarian calamity.
Mr Maduro is wary of the potential political ramifications of the coronavirus outbreak in Venezuela. He requested, to no avail, a US$5bn loan from the IMF to help the country to deal with the virus. With US dollars ever more scarce, severe shortages of goods and public services are likely over the coming months. Together with the government's mandatory social-distancing measures, which will further curb incomes, significant bouts of social unrest are likely.
However, despite these compounding social and economic shocks-and the US sanctions already in place-we expect Mr Maduro to retain power throughout 2020, ruling over what is becoming a much less populous and much poorer country. Mr Maduro has two main factors in his favour. First, the opposition, led by the head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, has lost the momentum that it held in 2019. Although Mr Guaidó enjoys wide international recognition as the legitimate leader of Venezuela, the current public health crisis is demonstrating once again that his interim government has no de facto power. Second, the regime retains strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces. Although the risks to our forecasts are very high, we assume that this control-together with the complexity of the security apparatus and the recurrent purges within it-will allow the regime to manage internal dissent.
Although it is not part of our baseline forecast, we recognise that there is an extremely high risk of some sort of political transition. There are three main paths to this: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We assess the prospect of military action, by the US or Colombia, as low. A negotiated transition would also be difficult, in our view. In early March the US outlined a transition framework in which both Mr Maduro and Mr Guaidó would allow a new state council to be created and fresh elections to be held. Mr Guaidó himself recently called for the creation of a "national emergency government" (which would not include Mr Maduro) to better combat the coronavirus epidemic. However, both proposals (and other negotiated solutions) are likely to fail, as trust issues between the sides are insurmountable. On March 26th the US indicted 14 top chavista officials, including Mr Maduro, discouraging the regime from co-operating on a negotiated exit. Nevertheless, successful talks with Colombia regarding humanitarian and/or health assistance are possible.
We believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The regime's main weakness is the fragility of its internal finances. Its patronage system is crucial for sustaining its security apparatus and resisting social unrest. Furthermore, the collapse in international crude prices and the dampening effect of a global recession on workers' remittances will shrink dollar inflows. The regime will continue to benefit from funds from drug trafficking and illegal mining activities, but a lack of hard currency could prove fatal to the patronage system and will test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks. The regime's liquidity problems and a rapidly worsening socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis could prompt putsch attempts in the near term.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch Assuming that the Maduro regime clings to power, legislative elections will take place in December. These elections will be neither free nor fair, and the opposition will lose control of the National Assembly. If the opposition were to secure some sort of political change in 2020, the interim government would pursue deep-seated reforms to the electoral authority and attempt to hold a vote within 12 months of its formation, although achieving this would be a major challenge.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations Mr Guaidó has marshalled strong support from the international community, but efforts by most governments in Latin America-under the Lima Group banner or through the Organisation of American States-to support him have reached an impasse. Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, the US, has instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions and has openly called for the Venezuelan military to accept him in place of Mr Maduro. The US expects sanctions to put enough pressure on the regime's finances (and therefore on its patronage system) so that Mr Maduro is forced to hold free and fair elections. The US also warned of additional sanctions in the near future. The US administration will remain hawkish in its approach to foreign policy, but we believe that a military intervention is unlikely, given the aversion of the US president, Donald Trump, to such adventurism. However, if tensions rise and political violence increases, the possibility of smaller-scale interventions cannot be discounted.
Mr Maduro's main international backers are Cuba and Russia. Russia is helping Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA, the Venezuelan state-owned oil company) to circumvent US sanctions; in March, the Venezuelan assets of Rosneft (a Russian energy company) were transferred directly to Russia, representing a step-up in the US-Russia diplomatic crossfire over Venezuela. Nevertheless, both Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the financing-amounting to tens of billions of US dollars per year-required to stabilise the economy and secure PDVSA's long-term future. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries, but seems to have had little success in securing finance for investment. If a transition from the Maduro regime were to come about, we believe that Russia and China would be willing to work with Mr Maduro's successor to protect their current investments.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends The Maduro regime will focus on weathering the collapse in oil prices and containing the looming public health crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak. At the time of writing the country had 159 reported cases of the virus and had reached Stage 4 (community spread). To contain the spread, Mr Maduro announced a mandatory nationwide quarantine lasting until at least April 13th and made the wearing of facemasks compulsory. To cushion the adverse effects of social distancing on people's incomes, Mr Maduro also announced extraordinary cash transfers and rent deferrals, but funds to finance such measures are scarce. Reflecting a lack of confidence in the government's ability to support incomes, quarantine restrictions have barely been followed; many workers lack savings to survive without continuing to work. Furthermore, the country's medical infrastructure is poor and hospitals face significant shortages of water, soap, medicines and electricity. Venezuela's health system is simply unprepared for Covid-19. The regime's overall lack of policymaking capacity will lead to accelerating hyperinflation, sharper bolívar depreciation and an even steeper recession in 2020.
Based on our view that Mr Maduro will retain power for the duration of our 2020-24 forecast period, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that are required to resolve the economic crisis. De facto dollarisation is expanding; although this was not a tacit goal for the regime, Mr Maduro now welcomes it. Other under-the-radar adjustments are possible in the coming years, as long as these benefit the survival of the regime. Such efforts alone are unlikely to bring about economic stability, owing to the absence of a comprehensive microeconomic reform or improvements in the rule of law, and policy predictability will not be forthcoming under the present regime. In this environment, domestic supply will be persistently weak.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy The authorities have not published complete data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect the non-financial public-sector deficit to narrow in 2020, and the public debt/GDP ratio to remain high in the coming years. The sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will curb government spending. The regime relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Money printing will continue to finance the government's deficits in 2020-24. However, over the medium term, growing remittance inflows will partly offset the need to monetise budget deficits. At present we assume no debt restructuring during the forecast period. The country's weak fiscal position is complicated by the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) that understates the true size of total public liabilities.
All of the sovereign's outstanding global bonds are in arrears. However, bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy shifts or a change in government. The key PDVSA 2020 bond, which was secured using 50.1% of the shares of Citgo (PDVSA's US subsidiary) as collateral, fell due at end-October 2019 and was not paid. A US court ruled that PDVSA is an "alter ego" of the Venezuelan government, which will have far-reaching implications. For example, a Canadian mining firm, Crystallex, is seeking to seize shares of Citgo stock. However, the US currently considers Citgo to be under Mr Guaidó's purview, thus shielding Citgo assets from seizure by creditors. However, once the PSUV retakes control of the (currently legitimate) National Assembly, Citgo assets will no longer be safeguarded.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy The government's financing needs will force the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) to ramp up money printing in the short term. Growing dollarisation and a strong contraction in domestic demand slowed hyper-inflationary pressures in 2019. However, we expect hyperinflation to return in the coming months, owing to monetisation of large fiscal deficits and severe goods shortages. Overall, hyperinflation will continue until its underlying causes are addressed. Hyperinflation has quickened the pace of dollarisation of the economy (more than 50% of transactions are now thought to be conducted in US dollars). We believe that Venezuela is heading towards overall de facto dollarisation. Monthly inflation will rise again in the short term and remain substantial. However, given the effect of dollarisation on price stability, we do not expect a return to the extremely high rates of annual inflation of over 1,000,000% experienced in 2018.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 36.2% in 2019 (and cumulative contraction of almost 70% since 2013), we expect a further decline, of 25.4%, in 2020. The contraction will follow the steep decline in crude prices and reflect the adverse effects of the government's quarantine measures, which-even if only partly followed-will further dent domestic demand. Ultra-low oil prices will hamper production, but most importantly, they will indirectly hit the non-oil economy through shortages of fuel and public services, scarcity of goods and reinvigorated hyperinflation. From a demand-side perspective, the GDP contraction will be driven by falling real incomes and continued mass emigration (which is fuelled by unemployment, violence and social instability).
The recent collapse in oil prices will put significant pressure on Venezuela to slash crude production. The country's average break-even price is about US$15-US$20 per barrel. US sanctions on the regime raise the risks involved in dealing with Venezuela, forcing the country to offer a hefty discount on its crude. This means that, at current market prices, Venezuela is selling its oil at a loss (its oil basket reached US$13.8/barrel at end-March). Although the country seeks to produce as much oil as possible, the current circumstances will inevitably lead to cuts in production; we expect oil output to decline from 760,000 barrels/day in February (according to OPEC), to 620,000 b/d on average in 2020. However, we believe that average output could fall as low as 500,000 b/d over the coming months.
In 2021 we expect the economy to grow marginally, owing to a stabilisation of oil output and to the base effects of lifting social-distancing measures. In 2022 economic growth will accelerate on the back of a surge in oil prices. However, in the medium term oil output will continue to fall-albeit gradually-owing to serious operational problems (such as difficulties in obtaining equipment for repairs or finding qualified staff) and to a limited pool of suitable buyers of Venezuelan crude. Export volumes will start to recover marginally in 2022-24 (owing to moderately higher global oil prices) as producers become more accustomed to the new post-sanctions export markets. Furthermore, relative macroeconomic stability will allow the non-oil economy to recover marginally in the medium term.
There are substantial risks to our forecasts, which assume that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout our forecast period. In the event of a transition, there would be upside risks to our medium-term baseline; the degree of the improvement would depend on the characteristics of the transition and on the new government's macroeconomic programme.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation Severely reduced domestic supply, constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits will bring about a return to hyperinflation this year. Dollarisation and the regime's heavy restrictions on credit helped to subdue hyperinflation in the second half of 2019. However, inflationary pressures will intensify substantially in the coming months, owing to widespread goods shortages and the ramping-up of government money printing. In the medium term inflation will remain high for as long as the Maduro regime is in power, given huge fundamental imbalances between supply and demand, and the need for the regime to monetise its fiscal deficits. Weather-related shocks are a perennial risk to the inflation outlook.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates Accelerating hyperinflation will quicken the pace of bolívar depreciation in 2020. Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency denomination (as in March 2018) or the introduction of a new currency is a strong possibility, although the exact nature of such a move is hard to forecast. In mid-2019 the Maduro regime announced a loosening of currency controls. Although this was a positive move, significant barriers limit access to US dollars via formal means. We continue to believe that the government will maintain a number of indirect controls on the foreign-exchange market. In this environment, a black-market exchange-rate premium is inevitable. On April 3rd the official exchange rate was BsS86,550:US$1, compared with a black-market rate of BsS94,120:US$1. The premium (currently at 8.7%) is small by historical comparison.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector Venezuela will post a small current-account deficit in 2020. The BCV's official figures for 2017-18 show that Venezuela posted current-account surpluses in this period. In 2019 the collapse of goods export earnings (owing to US sanctions on the oil trade) hit the trade balance hard. Nevertheless, based on the latest data, we estimate that the current account remained in surplus as a result of growing inflows of workers' remittances and the non-payment of interest on bonded debt (saving in excess of US$5bn in 2019). In 2020 Venezuela will post a current-account deficit of 1.6% of GDP, owing to even lower oil exports and limited remittance inflows resulting from a global recession.
We expect the current account to return to surplus in the medium term, averaging 5.9% of GDP in 2022-24. Goods exports will recover as international oil prices increase and the country steps up trade with Asian markets. This recovery will be supported by continued weakness in domestic demand, rising remittances from abroad and the fact that the sovereign will remain in default throughout the forecast period.

Full text: - The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the National Democratic Alliance government to serve out its second five-year term, which will expire in 2024. We expect the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to run a highly centralised administration. The administration's Hindu nationalistic agenda could raise the incidence of communal violence.
- The government imposed a 21-day lockdown nationwide from March 25th in response to the coronavirus epidemic. A lack of healthcare infrastructure makes India particularly vulnerable to the virus.
- India's relations with the US will remain warm in 2020-24. But disagreements on tariff and service sector export restrictions will limit trade deals. Relations with China will remain strained, owing to border disputes and concerns about that country's ambitions in South Asia. Bilateral relations with Pakistan will also remain strained, but we do not expect outright hostilities.
- The budget deficit will widen as a percentage of GDP in 2020/21 (April-March), as the government launches stimulus to keep households and firms afloat during the lockdown. It will narrow but still remain wide during the remainder of the forecast period.
- The RBI cut the policy repo rate by 75 basis points in response to coronavirus. We expect the RBI will tweak its policy tools and regulatory framework to facilitate the transmission of accommodative monetary policy.
- Real GDP growth will slump to 2.1% in 2020/21, down from an estimated 4.9% in 2019/20, and the lowest rate of expansion since 1991. The recovery will be sluggish in 2021/22, with GDP forecast to rise by 5.1%. We expect the growth will average 6.2% between 2022/23-2024/25.
- The rupee is forecast to depreciate against the US dollar in 2020, averaging Rs73.8:US$1. The currency will remain weak in 2021-24, owing to a persistent current-account deficit and rising domestic inflation.
- The merchandise trade deficit will narrow in 2020 amid low global oil prices. It will widen in the forecast period as India increases imports of capital goods. Business outsourcing and information technology will remain the key service export sectors in 2020-24.

- India's score rises over the forecast period, owing to improvements in the infrastructure category, but its overall regional ranking remains weak.

Country forecast overview: India's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: The government takes steps towards partial privatisation of some state-owned companies in 2021.
2022-24: The government continues to rationalise liquidation and bankruptcy laws to simplify the closure of loss-making businesses or merger and acquisition (M&A) activity involving other corporate entities.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Restrictions on foreign investment in multi-brand retail are partially removed.
2022-24: Foreign investment in export manufacturing increases markedly, albeit in only a few regions.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: The country remains reluctant to join major regional trade deals.
2022-24: Full capital-account convertibility remains off the policy agenda.
Taxes 2020-21: Rationalisation of the goods and services tax (GST) continues, resulting in a reduction in the number of tax bands. Tax breaks and rebates are made available to businesses and individuals impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.
2022-24: Alcohol and petroleum products remain outside the scope of the goods and services tax (GST).
Financing 2020-21: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) relaxes regulatory norms for debt-laden banks, raising risks to banking-sector stability but improving the availability of finance for corporate borrowers.
2022-24: Private-sector banks account for a rising share of total lending, while bad issues persist in public-sector banks.
The labour market 2020-21: Unemployment rises as a result of the lockdown. The government expands the rural employment guarantee scheme.
2022-24: Some labour reforms make headway at state level. However, reforms at central government level remain stuck, owing to a lack of political consensus behind the changes.
Infrastructure 2020-21: The government increases its budgetary allocation to healthcare facility projects, in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
2022-24: Construction of a high-speed rail link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad continues, but the project misses its targeted completion date of August 2022.
Technological readiness 2020-21: Most technological innovation continues to be concentrated in a few clusters, such as Bangalore. Expenditure on research and development (R&D) as a proportion of GDP remains low by regional standards.
2022-24: The government makes efforts to digitise the delivery of public services, in an effort to cut corruption and promote the efficiency of "last-mile delivery" for such services.

Background: India gained independence in 1947 after two centuries of British colonial rule. Partition at the same time created the state of Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars (two of them over the disputed territory of Kashmir). India is the second-most populous country in the world, with an estimated 1.35bn people in 2018, according to the UN. Its economy was the third-largest in the world in 2018 when measured in nominal US dollars or by purchasing power parity exchange rates.
Political structure: India has been a democracy since independence. At federal level, the Bharatiya Janata Party holds a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), although it governs in a broader coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). India follows the UK model of parliamentary government, with a prime minister as head of government. It has a president as the head of state. The country has a quasi-federal structure, with state governments having their own legislatures and enjoying a fair degree of freedom.
Policy issues: Progress on economic reform is constrained by a lack of consensus across the political spectrum over its nature and scope, and by a lack of will within the government to undertake politically risky structural reforms. The NDA administration has made headway in speeding up infrastructure projects, and this will remain a priority in the next five years. However, progress on more contentious issues, such as land and labour reforms, will be slight.
Taxation: The government will maintain efforts to broaden the tax base in 2020-24, including by further digitising tax departments. This, coupled with strong economic growth, will support a pick-up in tax collection. Despite some reforms, including the introduction of a nationwide goods and services tax in 2017, India's tax system will remain highly complex.
Foreign trade: India's trade deficit widened to US$186.7bn in 2018, from US$148.1bn in 2017, while its surplus on the services account rose from US$75.9bn to US$80.8bn.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the majority of seats in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) in the general election that took place in April-May 2019. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any threat to the BJP's domination of the central government during its term, which ends in 2024.
The results of the 2019 election were testament to the popularity of the prime minister, Narendra Modi. He will remain the dominant figure in the government. Decision-making will remain centralised among the prime minister's office (PMO) and key ministers and officials whom Mr Modi trusts, the most prominent being the national security adviser, Ajit Doval. We believe that the PMO and Mr Doval will continue to set the policy agenda over the next five years. The lockdown measures have been welcomed by the public as an effective measure to halt the spread of the coronavirus. Mr Modi will continue to enjoy the popularity but any significant disruption during the lockdown will damage his reputation.
Social unrest will pose a threat to political stability during the forecast period. Clashes between religious groups will intensify in states with a history of communal violence, such as Uttar Pradesh and Assam. In contrast to the country's current secular constitution, several far-right groups, including some affiliated with the BJP, have long been pushing for India to be recast as a Hindu nation-a view that puts them at odds with minority groups, notably Muslims. Violent protests are continuing across India following the enactment in December of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019, with some fearing that the change will erode secularism and others concerned about unchecked immigration. State governments (which control the local police in India) will be keen to restore order quickly following any instances of communal violence, although some may not implement the changes to the citizenship law.
The security situation in the state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) will remain a key concern in the early part of the forecast period. The government's decision in August 2019 to revoke the special status accorded to the state sparked protests. Despite the deployment of large numbers of troops and the arrest of many local leaders, further unrest cannot be ruled out. We expect security risks in the area to remain high in the medium term. Any attempt by protesters to destabilise the region is likely to face a heavy-handed response from the government, including the use of internet shut-downs, curfews and riot-control forces. The government's move has also increased the risk of related terrorist attacks by separatist forces in major Indian cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch The next general election is expected to be held around May 2024. The focus before then will be on gauging support for the BJP in the state assembly elections. However, the results of recent state elections suggest that voters treat state and national elections differently, and that local issues tend to be more important. We believe that the BJP will perform poorly in the state election in Bihar later in the year.
In the Rajya Sabha (the upper house), the BJP and its allies form the largest grouping, although they command fewer than half the total number of seats. Assuming that the BJP retains control of key state assemblies and wins control of a few more in the next few years, the party and its allies within the larger National Democratic Alliance (NDA) could secure a simple majority in the upper house. This will enable the alliance to pass legislation without opposition approval. However, it will struggle to win the two-thirds majority needed to make constitutional changes unchallenged.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations Tensions with Pakistan will be exacerbated by the Indian government's move in August to revoke the special status granted to J&K. We expect relations to remain strained, but do not anticipate a complete breakdown of diplomatic ties. We believe that Pakistan's military will increase its support for militant groups in Indian-controlled Kashmir in the short term. This will raise the risk of terrorist attacks by non-state actors there. Although small-scale military exchanges between the two countries are likely to occur in 2020-24, we believe that the two governments will ensure that these do not escalate into a full-blown conflict.
The US president, Donald Trump, visited India in February 2020. India and the US have affirmed further co-operation on defence policy and confirmed a military equipment purchase. However, they failed to reach even a limited trade deal, owing to disagreements on India's tariff collection and restrictions on service sector exports by the US. In general, ties will remain cordial, underpinned by a mutual desire to counter China's growing influence.
China's sway in South Asia and its close ties with Pakistan will remain a bone of contention between China and India. Despite attempts at a reset of bilateral ties in recent years, territorial disputes between China and India will persist, and relations will remain tense in 2020-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends The BJP government will enjoy considerable flexibility in determining the economic policy agenda, given its majority in the Lok Sabha. The key near-term priority for the administration is to contain the development of the coronavirus outbreak, to which India is particularly vulnerable, given its large population and weak healthcare infrastructure. The government's approach will include effectively quarantining the country (a 21-day lockdown began on March 25th), enhancing the capacity of the healthcare system and ratifying a stimulus plan to bolster the economy. The government delivered a first stimulus-relief package targeted at low-income groups on March 26th, which included direct cash transfers and food giveaways. A fiscal relief package for businesses will also be forthcoming. Incentives will be offered to labour-intensive sectors and special allowance given to service sectors that are heavily impacted by the closure of businesses, including transportation and hospitality. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) will also extend liquidity support, including a three-month moratorium on all term loans.
The government's broader policy agenda will be deprioritised, at least in 2020. It is unlikely to push for radical reforms that are politically contentious, such as a comprehensive overhaul of land-acquisition laws or labour regulations. However, piecemeal changes to such legislation, such as the relaxation of certain regulatory requirements and a modest liberalisation of foreign investment, could be undertaken. Nevertheless, we expect only limited gains from this, as the Modi administration will be hesitant to push ahead with productivity-enhancing reforms that could be politically damaging. The lockdown will amplify the mounting non-performing loan (NPL) issues in the banking sector. The risk of systemic failure of banks is not negligible.
Infrastructure projects-particularly pet projects of the Modi government, such as the National infrastructure Pipeline and the Smart Cities Mission-remain a priority, partly in response to the rapid pace of urbanisation and partly to boost the business environment. In light of the coronavirus outbreak, healthcare facilities will become another focus of government investment.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy The coronavirus outbreak will force the government to rewrite its approved budget for 2020/21, which was conservatively expansionary. It will likely temporarily suspend the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act to allow for more flexibility in terms of supporting the economy. As a result, we have widened our budget deficit forecast for 2020/21 to the equivalent of 5.1% of GDP, from 3.7% previously.
Lockdown policies and the demands of healthcare provision mean that the government will implement relatively aggressive fiscal stimulus. Measures will include a direct cash-transfer initiative to households. The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act will be expanded, contrary to the plan in the approved budget. Further plans include an infrastructure development programme and tax break for businesses. These measures will go alongside reforms included in the approved budget, such as the simplification of income tax for individuals in certain income groups and the abolition of the dividend distribution tax.
As the economy recovers, the government will look to consolidate the public finances. This will lead to a narrowing of the budget deficit to the equivalent of 3.9% of GDP in 2021/22. However, the government will struggle to bring down the deficit much further over the remainder of the forecast period. The authorities will look to deepen the tax base and increase low levels of tax compliance. However, the need to support welfare payments and infrastructure spending will keep upward pressure on fiscal expenditure. We also expect subsidies for labour-intensive, small-scale businesses, particularly those that are export-focused, in an effort to promote exports and employment.
This federal fiscal picture does not reflect the large deficits of several state governments, which are not included in the national figures. The deep deficits in some states, such as Himachal Pradesh, will present implicit liabilities for the central government.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy The coronavirus epidemic will prompt monetary policy loosening by the RBI. In March, the central bank lowered its policy repo rate by 75 basis points to 4.4%, as well as widening the monetary policy corridor by lowering the reverse repo rate (the "floor" of the corridor) by 90 basis points, to 4%. With inflationary pressures moderating and economic growth under strong near-term downward pressure, further adjustments are likely. We are not yet forecasting a further 50-basis-point reduction in the policy repo rate in 2020/21. But we expect the adoption of more unconventional policy instruments. This will include cuts to the reserve cash ratio, liquidity to support long-term refinancing operations and a moratorium, of three months initially, on all term loan repayments.
These measures will aim to keep businesses afloat during lockdown periods and as the coronavirus affects household spending and business investment. However, the outcome might be far from satisfying. The transmission from monetary policy rate to actual lending is not so smooth, as the banks are also reluctant to lend. Also, the informal sector cannot lend from normal financial institutions and, therefore, will be hard to benefit from these policies. The level of non-performing assets in the financial sector is alarming, and the coronavirus outbreak may amplify the issue, with more firms forced out of business. The government might have to recapitalise the banks through rescue mergers with public-sector banks, or even directly nationalise the stressed banks.
The RBI has maintained inflation-targeting as the cornerstone of its monetary policy framework. It seeks to contain consumer price inflation within a 2-6% range, and close to a target of 4%. However, strong political pressure on the RBI-which has forced out two hawkish heads of the bank under BJP rule-has complicated these objectives.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth The coronavirus outbreak will take a significant toll on the Indian economy. The nationwide lockdown, with factories and office buildings closed, will remove a significant proportion of economic activity while it remains in place. A loss of income, corporate bankruptcy and a jump in unemployment will affect household spending and business investment beyond the lockdown. As a result, we forecast that real GDP growth will decelerate sharply, to 2.1% in 2020/21, from estimated expansion of 4.9% in 2019/20. Expansion of this level would be the lowest since 1991. The economy will contract (on a year-on-year basis) in the first half of 2020/21 (April-September), before mounting a recovery in the second half of the year as the coronavirus outbreak comes under greater control and the global economy recovers.
On a GDP expenditure basis, private consumption will contract, as people are unable to consume as much with lockdown and lower incomes. The investment sentiment will also fall, which eventually brought investment to contraction. The government will be actively bolstering the economy through government expenditure, but the effect will be limited. We expect both exports and imports to fall amid global lockdown.
The economic recovery will be modest initially, with growth forecast at 5.1% in 2021/22, as businesses continue to withhold investment. An anticipated tightening of monetary policy in 2022-23 will also weigh on sentiment. Over the long term, progress on structural reforms will be too slow to give real GDP a significant boost.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation We expect consumer prices to increase by an average of 5.7% in 2020 as a whole, compared with 3.7% in 2019. Upward pressure on prices will stem from supply-side disruptions caused by coronavirus control measures. The outbreak has significantly slowed down the traffic of goods and eliminated some logistical options. This will inevitably lead to a hike in prices. Price pressures will abate from the second half of this year, as forthcoming harvests boost food supplies and lockdown gradually eases. Our forecast assumes a normal monsoon this year (and in every year of the outlook period).
The RBI will keep its policy rate unchanged in 2021 to bolster the recovery. The adoption of a tighter monetary policy stance by the RBI in 2022 will offset the inflationary impact of strengthening oil prices. The central bank will accord higher priority to containing inflationary pressures towards the end of the forecast period; consumer price inflation is expected to ease to 3.4% in 2024.
Low oil prices in 2020 will cause producer price inflation to soften to 0.8% in the year. As prices for oil and other commodities strengthen, producer price inflation will firm to an average of 3.6% in 2021-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates The RBI's adoption of a fairly aggressive loosening stance in 2019, along with high political risks associated with the removal of J&K's special constitutional status and changes to the citizenship law, have weighed on the exchange rate. The coronavirus outbreak has amplified such pressures. We forecast that the rupee will depreciate by 4.5% on an annual average basis, to Rs73.8:US$1 in 2020, as investors flee to safe haven assets and the domestic economic situation worsens. In 2021 we expect the rupee to appreciate slightly, to an average of Rs72.7:US$1, as investor confidence returns. The rupee will depreciate in 2022-23 amid rising oil prices. We expect the currency to appreciate slightly in 2024, owing to an easing of external pay-ment pressures.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector The lower oil price and weaker domestic demand will contribute to a narrowing of India's current-account deficit in 2020, when it is forecast to stand at the equivalent of 0.3% of GDP. Merchandise export growth will be tempered by disruptions caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus globally in the year, but is expected to rebound in 2021 amid a pick-up in global commerce. In the longer term, India's export manufacturing sector will still be held back by restrictive labour laws and difficulties in securing land for production facilities. Increased competition from other countries and changing industrial trends will weigh on the pace of growth in India's main service export sectors, particularly business process outsourcing and information technology (IT). Nevertheless, the services balance will remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, making a positive contribution to the current account. Owing to the large shortfall on merchandise trade, however, the current account will remain in deficit in the remainder of the forecast period. The coronavirus outbreak will weigh on inward investment in 2020. Inward direct investment will recover modestly in 2021-24, as the expanding economy and growing consumer demand provide opportunities for businesses.

Full text: - The unfolding economic crisis, stemming from the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, will complicate policymaking for the remainder of the term of the president, Lenín Moreno, which ends in May 2021. Commitment to fiscal discipline in the face of a deteriorating macroeconomic environment will embolden political opposition to the government ahead of presidential and legislative elections in February 2021, and will raise the risk of social unrest. Irrespective of the election outcome, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects sizable barriers to governing and to stability to persist, considering the highly fragmented political landscape. Assuming that a centrist government is elected, these headwinds will hamper piecemeal liberalising economic reforms.
- Ecuador is one of the smallest markets in our business environment rankings. The country's mineral reserves will continue to attract oil and mining investors, but the domestic market will grow only slightly as it struggles to recover from the recession engendered by the coronavirus outbreak. We forecast that GDP per head (at market exchange rates) will rise marginally from US$6,166 in 2019 to US$6,201 in 2024. As such, business opportunities will remain restricted by low purchasing power, as well as by a small market size.
- Under the auspices of the IMF, the government will cut public spending and investment to shore up the public finances. Despite a statistical rebound in real GDP in 2021, the country's short-term growth prospects will be curbed by soft oil prices, which will also weigh on the fiscal and external accounts. Notwithstanding political and economic uncertainties, we expect dollar-isation to be maintained in the 2020-24 forecast period, as it remains popular for delivering macroeconomic stability and for taming inflation.
- Population growth is slowing, owing to a falling birth rate and continued emigration (albeit at lower levels). However, at an annual average of 1.3% per year in 2020-24, population growth will be on a par with that of neighbouring Andean nations. The unemployment rate will remain low in historical terms, falling from a forecast 5.1% in 2020 to 4.7% by 2024; underemployment will continue to be high. The informal sector will remain substantial, partly owing to labour market rigidities. Although low levels of productivity and a wealth of natural resources offer scope for Ecuador to catch up with more developed countries, poor prospects for institutional improvements are likely to preclude a stable economic policy direction. Therefore, we forecast that income will continue to lag OECD levels in the long term.

- Ecuador scores poorly in our business environment rankings, owing to its dependence on oil and the current administration's timid embrace of orthodox policymaking. Although the country's score improves slightly in the forecast period, its global ranking remains low. The government will seek more private investment, but structural shortcomings in the investment environment will not be fully addressed, hindering investors' perceptions.

Country forecast overview: Ecuador's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: Fuel subsidies are gradually, albeit not completely, rolled back in targeted manner. Implementation of antitrust policies is subject to politicisation. Select industries (such as mining) benefit from policies promoting supply-side growth.
2022-24: Government continues to scale back state's role in development. Nonetheless, regulation and licensing continue to favour state-run companies over private-sector firms. A new public-private partnership model is trialled.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Overtures to foreign firms and pro-business reforms partly offset the government's continual interventionism.
2022-24: Inadequate property-rights protection and questions over access to foreign arbitration deter investment. New mining projects attract investment.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: Government maintains capital outflows tax and increases import tariffs to protect dollarisation.
2022-24: Supply-side reforms enhance national competitiveness and government begins to phase out capital outflows tax.
Taxes 2020-21: Government implements tax reform to expand tax base and improve collection. Certain exemptions will be eliminated, while other burdensome regulations are simplified.
2022-24: Efforts continue to increase tax collection, supporting revenue growth. Tax system remains complex.
Financing 2020-21: Deposit and credit growth are moderate and support banking stability.
2022-24: Financing is still below potential as public-financing needs curb growth of long-term lending to private sector.
The labour market 2020-21: Government takes steps to reduce public-wage bill and reduce labour market rigidities.
2022-24: Quality of workforce remains poor. Labour reforms are slow to take effect.
Infrastructure 2020-21: Fiscal constraints lead to cancellation of several projects. Efforts to drum up large-scale foreign investment achieve little success.
2022-24: Renewed interest in port and airport development sustains new cycle of investment.
Technological readiness 2020-21: Investment to expand fourth-generation (4G) broadband availability.
2022-24: Increasing adoption of civic technologies by government. Fifth-generation (5G) technology remains in its infancy.

Background: Ecuador restored its presidential democracy in 1979, but its institutions remain fragile. External economic shocks have contributed to the ousting of three presidents by popular protest since 1997. The current president, Lenín Moreno, took office in May 2017, succeeding Rafael Correa (2007-17)-the longest-serving president in Ecuadorean history. In February 2018 a series of constitutional reforms introduced by Mr Moreno (including the reintroduction of a two-term limit for the presidency) were approved by referendum. Although this was a step towards deeper democratisation, persistent social and fiscal challenges will continue to weigh on governability.
Political structure: The 2008 constitution increased executive power, but has done little to foster institutional capacity to tackle problems such as a politicised judiciary, powerful business lobbies, and mobilised grassroots and indigenous groups. The political system is fragmented. Mr Moreno retains strong executive powers, but his Alianza País lost considerable standing after the results of the 2018 referendum splintered the party.
Policy issues: Dollarisation has provided macroeconomic stability but exposed Ecuador's underlying lack of competitive-ness. Modest oil prices during the 2020-24 forecast period, relative to the previous decade, have necessitated fiscal adjustments. A three-year IMF agreement (along with other multilateral financing), secured by the Moreno administration in March 2019 after borrowing in international capital markets became unsustainable, will be leveraged to address these shortcomings. The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic will complicate the government's economic reform agenda, especially considering its lack of fiscal space to counter the hit to the economy and financial system.
Taxation: Taxes have been subject to frequent changes. The main taxes in Ecuador are income tax, levied at rates of up to 35%, and value-added tax (VAT), levied at 12%. Private firms must distribute 15% of their profits among their employees.
Foreign trade: Ecuador recorded an estimated trade surplus of US$865m in 2019. Weak external demand is likely to preclude a trade surplus in 2020, before an expansion of earnings from oil, banana and shrimp exports support trade surpluses in 2021-24.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The unfolding novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic presents the president, Lenín Moreno, with two immense challenges before his term ends in May 2021. First, Mr Moreno must work to contain the spread of the virus with limited resources. Strict national lockdown measures have been in place since mid-March but the virus has spread rapidly, with more than 1,400 cases reported as of March 26th. It remains to be seen whether the country has the capacity to handle a health crisis of this scale. Although there is broad consensus for thorough containment measures, policymaking and the political environment will be complicated as the crisis unfolds, considering that the political land-scape is highly fragmented; Mr Moreno lacks a majority-his Alianza País (AP) has 42 seats, 27 short of the threshold-and the February 2021 elections are approaching. The second challenge for Mr Moreno is stabilising the economy as oil prices tumble, lockdown measures stifle activity and external demand shrinks. With no fiscal space to mount a countercyclical response (Mr Moreno has announced cuts to public spending and revenue-raising measures), the political opposition will be emboldened, political instability aggravated and the risk of social unrest heightened significantly. A daily curfew from 2pm to 5am is in effect until end-March (with the potential to be extended) but, with the economic situation for millions of Ecuadoreans quickly worsening, there is a high probability for protests to occur in the next few months, especially considering that indigenous groups responsible for intense protests in October 2019 have called for a permanent mobilisation against the government.
Commitment to socially unpalatable and politically divisive economic measures will help the government to retain IMF support, but will dissolve support for the president. Mr Moreno has staked his presidency on his economic programme backed by a three-year, US$4.2bn extended fund facility (EFF) with the IMF, and US$6bn in additional multilateral financing (intended to be disbursed between March 2019 and December 2021). On March 23rd, amid the coronavirus outbreak, the administration made Ecuador's second-ever bond repayment. In doing so, the president snubbed a nearly unanimous request from the legislature that debt payments are to be suspended, reflecting the governability challenges that the Moreno administration faces as it seeks to renegotiate its current IMF arrangement and advance its reform agenda.
Political jockeying will be a constant undercurrent as elections near. Political leaders from across the ideological spectrum will seek to capitalise on the economic crisis and elevate their position. Radical leftist ideals supported by the former president, Rafael Correa (2007-17), may return to the fore as the economy languishes-despite the fact that Mr Correa himself is facing calls from the country's attorney-general to serve seven years in prison (amid a corruption trial) and remains out of the country. For now, however, it is unlikely that his supporters will re-emerge as the dominant political force, and political uncertainties will prevail (rather than dissipate) in the short to medium term.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch The next legislative and presidential elections are scheduled for February 2021. The Economist Intelligence Unit currently assumes that the president will serve out the rest of his term. An early termination of Mr Moreno's term (either through his resignation or elections being brought forward) would intensify economic uncertainties and throw the country into political turmoil-outcomes that most parties are keen to avoid. Nevertheless, the presidential poll result is nebulous at this stage, owing to obscurity caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
Mr Moreno has signalled that he does not intend to run and, given his government's commitment to unpopular economic measures, it is unlikely that a member of his centre-left AP will secure victory. However, should the government successfully navigate the health crisis, the vice-president, Otto Sonnenholzner, may rise in stature. The conservative opposition Partido Social Cristiano (PSC) performed well in municipal elections in March 2019, and is strongly placed to capitalise on the fragmented political landscape and mount a robust campaign. The other major conservative opposition party, Creando Oportunidades led by Guillermo Lasso (who narrowly lost to Mr Moreno in 2017), also may grow in appeal.
A candidate backed by Mr Correa could play a significant role in the election, as the government struggles to weather the worsening economic situation. On balance, even though a Correa-backed candidate may make it to the second round, we believe that Mr Sonnenholzner, a PSC candidate or Mr Lasso are more likely to win. We would expect these administrations to pursue centrist economic policies, and we have based our medium-term forecasts on this assumption.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations The foreign policy agenda of Mr Moreno will remain focused on strengthening diplomatic and commercial ties with major trading partners, mainly the US (Ecuador's largest trading partner). In the short term, however, the coronavirus pandemic and Ecuador's unfolding economic crisis is likely to hamper free-trade agreement (FTA) discussions with the US (talks were scheduled to take place in April) and Ecuador's accession to the Pacific Alliance (a regional trade bloc). The latter may also be hindered by the absence of an existing bilateral agreement with Mexico; however, Ecuador and Mexico have ambitiously set February 7th 2021 (the date of general election in Ecuador) as the deadline for an FTA.
There is a reasonable chance that Ecuador will enter the bloc by 2024, considering that the presidents within the Pacific Alliance (as well as Mexico's foreign minister) have expressed their support for Ecuador's swift accession to the group. However, unexpected hitches or changes in government and policy direction may yet hinder the accession process.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends The coronavirus outbreak will push Ecuador towards default and a balance-of-payments crisis. Avoiding this will require, more than ever, the support of the IMF (and other actors), but meeting the conditions required to access these funds will be extremely complicated politically, heightening risks in the coming months. Political pressure to loosen fiscal policy and suspend debt payments is mounting, and will continue to rise, but Mr Moreno will try to maintain fiscal discipline and work to improve the country's credibility with investors, most likely seeking an amicable restructuring of its debt with private creditors, rather than a disorderly default.
Mr Moreno's stance will help to unlock much-needed financial assistance from multilateral development banks and the IMF. The government has requested a US$500m loan through the Fund's Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) by end-April, which the IMF is considering. Unlike fully fledged IMF programmes, RFIs come with little conditionality, and this should provide the government with some policy leeway, considering the circumstances, assuming that the request is approved (we have pencilled the funds into our forecasts). That said, we do not expect a dramatic loosening of policy either, as the government will be hoping that its show of credibility will help it to secure at least US$1bn from China (which we have also pencilled into our forecasts). New external financing and close collaboration between the government and the IMF will be paramount to navigating the developing crisis in the coming weeks and months, as the government is working to establish a new arrangement with the Fund that builds on the current EFF.
The objectives of the government's IMF-backed economic programme will be overshadowed by the policy response to the economic and health crises. We expect that the government will still pursue labour reform and the removal of fuel subsidies, having stated before the crisis that a gradual and less drastic fuel subsidy reduction would be rolled out by June, but short-term measures to boost health expenditure and provide support to the economy will take precedence for now.
Assuming that a centre-right or centre-left government takes office in May 2021 (before the final EFF review in December of that year) and provides for policy continuity, we expect that the four primary objectives of the EFF will continue to be prioritised in the medium to long term. These include improving competitiveness, tackling fiscal imbalances, protecting the poor and fighting corruption. Moreover, under our political assumptions and in the light of the unfolding crises, we view IMF assistance beyond 2021 as a highly probable scenario. This suggests a piecemeal advancement of business-friendly policies and complementary reforms in 2021-24. Nonetheless, limited progress will be made in diversifying the economy away from oil (the country left OPEC in January to free itself from quotas).
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy The government will have limited success in cushioning the blow to the fiscal accounts from the drastic halt to domestic economic activity and lower oil revenue than previously anticipated in the budget. We thus expect both a widening of the fiscal deficit and a cut in public expenditure, although there are huge political risks to the latter in particular. Even assuming that new, extraordinary multilateral and bilateral assistance is forthcoming, this will not be enough to plug the fiscal hole produced by the collapse in oil prices.
In mid-March Mr Moreno announced that the government would accelerate the downsizing of the state and reduce spending by US$1.4bn in 2020 to help to offset the fall in revenue from oil sales. Of the US$1.4bn reduction (equivalent to around 1.3% of GDP), US$845m will come from lower spending on goods and services, while US$535m will stem from lower capital expenditure. The government also aims to raise a further US$900m through one-off contributions and increased income tax withholdings from large companies. Some revenue-raising measures will require legislative approval, suggesting that the government's estimated US$2.3bn in fiscal savings is overly optimistic.
We forecast that the non-financial public-sector (NFPS) deficit will widen to 4.7% of GDP in 2020, assuming that public spending is cut by much less than revenue. As a result, public debt as a percentage of GDP will rise from an estimated 45.7% of GDP in 2019 to 51.6% in 2020. Accordingly, the fiscal targets set in the government's EFF are unfeasible-the pace of fiscal adjustment was already slowed at end-2019 in a combined second and third review of the EFF and the fourth review suspended-and we view as impossible both an improvement of 4 percent-age points in the non-oil primary balance/GDP ratio (including subsidies) between 2019 and 2021, and a reduction in the public debt/GDP ratio to 40% by 2024.
The successor IMF agreement being negotiated will shed light on how fiscal targets and fiscal policymaking adapt to the looming economic recession. Irrespective of the changes, programme implementation risks will be glaringly high as social and political challenges to reforms exceed their pre-crisis levels. Without details on a new deal, and assuming policy continuity, we expect the NFPS deficit to gradually narrow in 2021-24, to 2.4% of GDP by 2024, and for the public debt/GDP ratio to stabilise at around 57%.
We are cautiously optimistic that that the government will avoid a disorderly default, owing to bilateral and multilateral financing. The government estimates that it will receive about US$2bn from multilateral creditors and China, after the government made a final US$325m payment on the capital of a 10.5%, five-year bond in mid-March. The government also plans to take advantage of a 30-day grace period on other payments totalling US$200m, as its response to the coronavirus outbreak saps its resources. Even so, and although it is not yet our baseline forecast, there is a substantial risk that Ecuador will be forced into a debt restructuring this year or fall into disorderly default ahead of larger payments in the second half of 2020.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy As a dollarised economy, Ecuador lacks independent monetary policy, and will not be able to foment a monetary policy response to the emerging economic crisis. Monetary conditions will remain largely determined by external factors, but real local rates will remain elevated, owing to Ecuador's high risk premium.
Monetary growth will hinge on foreign-exchange inflows, as well as the confidence of domestic lenders, both of which will be markedly undermined by the rapid deterioration of the economy. The threat of de-dollarisation will sustain the risk of capital flight, which raises the risk that preventative measures in the short term are implemented in order to protect domestic liquidity levels.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth The economy will enter a recession in 2020. Before the crash in oil prices and the acceleration of the spread of the coronavirus, we held the view that net exports would support tepid real GDP growth (less than 1%). We now expect real GDP to contract by 6.5% in 2020. Net exports are still likely to positively contribute to growth despite a marked drop in export volumes; we expect them to decrease by 8% as external demand falls markedly, but this drop will be overshadowed by a 13.1% decline in import volumes. The marked decline in import volumes reflects a significant deterioration in domestic demand. Low oil receipts will lead to a retrenchment in government consumption, indirectly feeding through to private consumption, which will also be constrained by a worsening labour market. Economic and political uncertainties will weigh on private investment, which is set to decline for a second-consecutive year.
Assuming that the coronavirus outbreak is controlled by end-2020, prompting a recovery in external and domestic demand, we expect real GDP growth to rebound in 2021, but it will remain below 2019 levels. Political uncertainties will be elevated by the February 2021 general election and this will preclude a more robust pick-up in domestic demand. We expect growth to be tepid in 2022, considering the 2021 rebound, but it should slowly improve thereafter as policy uncertainties wane, oil prices rise and moderate improvements to the business environment materialise.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation Tumbling commodity prices, weak demand, fiscal tightening and a rising US dollar will produce deflation this year. Consumer prices were flat in 2019, and we assume that consumer prices will fall by an average 0.4% this year. We expect inflation to pick up slightly, to an annual average of 0.9% in 2021-24, as import costs rise owing to renewed dollar weakness and an increase in commodity prices. Dollarisation will help to contain inflation, but the economy will remain vulnerable to increases in food and energy prices.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates Risks to dollarisation have spiked and will remain elevated in the short term. The economic crisis presents major problems of financing and liquidity, as oil prices have crashed and access to global financing remains limited. These problems are likely to be compounded by a short-term strengthening of the US dollar (hurting competitiveness) and a dip in reserves.
Nevertheless, we currently assume that dollarisation will be retained during the forecast period, as the government's commitment to its IMF agreement and to fiscal discipline allows for greater multilateral financing. The real effective exchange rate will remain stronger than its long-term, pre-dollarisation average but, in real trade-weighted terms, there will be some depreciation as the US dollar begins to weaken in 2021-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector We now expect that the current account will deteriorate in 2020, as the macroeconomic backdrop has worsened significantly since our last monthly report. Weaker than expected oil revenue will weigh significantly on the trade balance in the short-term, as oil prices languish and external demand withers.
Non-oil export earnings will be hit hard, with shrimp and mining exports in particular suffering from domestic restrictions on business operations to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and a retraction of demand in major export markets, including China and the US. The deterioration of the trade balance will be softened by collapsing domestic demand, which will engender import compression. However, remittances are also likely to suffer as economic activity has ground to a halt outside Ecuador, dragging down the current-account deficit. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows will pick up in the medium term after suffering in 2020-21, which will preclude a build up in foreign-exchange reserves, but will remain below 1% of GDP.

Full text: - The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the National Democratic Alliance government to serve out its second five-year term, which will expire in 2024. We expect the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to run a highly centralised administration
- Relations with the US will remain warm in 2020-24. Trade tension might ease, as a limited trade pact is in reach. Despite efforts to normalise relations, ties with China will remain strained, owing to border disputes and concerns about that country's rising influence in South Asia. Bilateral relations with Pakistan will also remain strained in 2020-24. Small-scale military exchanges cannot be ruled out, but we do not expect outright hostilities.
- The budget deficit will widen as a percentage of GDP in fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March), owing to a slew of fiscal measures, most notably a cut in corporate tax. The fiscal deficit will remain wide overall during the forecast period, as the government will raise expenditure and fund spending based on uncertain divestment.
- The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) to leave its policy rates unchanged in 2020 before embarking on a tightening cycle from 2021. The RBI will tweak its policy tools and regulatory framework to facilitate the transmission of its accommodative monetary policy.
- Real GDP growth will slump to 4.9% in 2019/20, owing to a slowdown in private consumption and infrastructure investment. Economic growth will recover to an annual average of 6.3% in 2020/21-2024/25.
- We expect consumer price inflation to exceed the mid-point of the central bank's 2-6% target range in 2020-24. The key driver will be a sustained recovery in domestic demand. Our forecasts assume normal monsoons.
- The rupee is forecast to depreciate slightly against the US dollar in 2020, averaging Rs70.6:US$1 in 2020. The currency will remain weak in 2021-24, owing to a persistent current-account deficit and rising domestic inflation.
- India will remain dependent on imports for its fuel and capital goods needs. The merchandise trade deficit will therefore widen during the forecast period. Business process outsourcing and information technology will remain the key service export sectors in 2020-24.

Country forecast overview: India's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: The government takes steps towards partial or complete privatisation of some state-owned companies.
2022-24: The government continues to rationalise liquidation and bankruptcy laws to simplify the closure of loss-making businesses or their merger or acquisition by other corporate entities.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Restrictions on foreign investment in multi-brand retail are partially removed.
2022-24: Foreign investment in export manufacturing increases markedly, albeit in only a few regions.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: A limited trade deal is signed with the US.
2022-24: Full capital-account convertibility remains off the policy agenda.
Taxes 2020-21: The government will abolish dividend distribution tax, and the goods and services tax (GST) will be simplified slightly.
2022-24: Alcohol and petroleum products remain outside the scope of the GST.
Financing 2020-21: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) relaxes regulatory norms for debt-laden banks and micro, small and medium enterprises.
2022-24: Private-sector banks account for a rising share of total lending, while bad issues persist in public-sector banks.
The labour market 2020-21: Reforms to labour laws move at a glacial pace, owing to obstruction by trade unions and opposition groups.
2022-24: Some labour reforms make headway at state level. However, reforms at central-government level remain stuck, owing to a lack of political consensus behind the changes.
Infrastructure 2020-21: The government increases its budgetary allocation for projects such as the Bharatmala road connectivity scheme.
2022-24: Construction of a high-speed rail link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad continues, but the project misses its targeted completion date of August 2022.
Technological readiness 2020-21: Most technological innovation continues to be concentrated in a few clusters, such as Bangalore. Expenditure on research and development as a proportion of GDP remains low by regional standards.
2022-24: The government makes efforts to digitise the delivery of public services, in an effort to cut corruption and promote the efficiency of "last-mile delivery" for such services.

Background: India gained independence in 1947 after two centuries of British colonial rule. Partition at the same time created the state of Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars (two of them over the disputed territory of Kashmir). India is the second-most populous country in the world, with an estimated 1.35bn people in 2018, according to the UN. Its economy was the third-largest in the world in 2018 when measured in nominal US dollars or by purchasing power parity exchange rates.
Political structure: India has been a democracy since independence. At federal level, the Bharatiya Janata Party holds a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), although it governs in a broader coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). India follows the UK model of parliamentary government, with a prime minister as head of government. It has a president as the head of state. The country has a quasi-federal structure, with state governments having their own legislatures and enjoying a degree of freedom.
Policy issues: Progress on economic reform is constrained by a lack of consensus across the political spectrum over its nature and scope, and by a lack of will within the government to undertake politically risky structural reforms. The NDA administration has made headway in speeding up infrastructure projects, and this will remain a priority in the next five years. However, progress on more contentious issues, such as land and labour reforms, will be slight.
Taxation: The government will maintain efforts to broaden the tax base in 2020-24, including by further digitising tax departments. This, coupled with strong economic growth, will support a pick-up in tax collection. Despite some reforms, including the introduction of a nationwide goods and services tax in 2017, India's tax system will remain highly complex.
Foreign trade: India's trade deficit widened to US$186.7bn in 2018, from US$148.1bn in 2017, while its surplus on the services account rose from US$75.9bn to US$80.8bn.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the majority of seats in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) in the general election that took place in April-May 2019. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any threat to the BJP's domination of the central government during its term, which ends in 2024. This will ensure continuity in policy, particularly as this is the second consecutive term for the BJP.
The results of the 2019 election were testament to the popularity of the prime minister, Narendra Modi. He will remain the dominant figure in the government. Decision-making will remain centralised among the prime minister's office (PMO) and key ministers and officials whom Mr Modi trusts, the most prominent being the national security adviser, Ajit Doval. We believe that the PMO and Mr Doval will continue to dominate the policy agenda in the next five years.
Social unrest will pose a threat to political stability during the forecast period. Clashes between religious groups will intensify in states with a history of communal violence, such as Uttar Pradesh and Assam. In contrast to the country's current secular constitution, several far-right groups, including some affiliated with the BJP, have long been pushing for India to be recast as a Hindu nation-a view that puts them at odds with minority groups, notably Muslims. Violent protests are continuing across India following the enactment in December of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019, with some fearing that the change will erode secularism and others concerned about unchecked immigration. State governments (which control the local police in India) will be keen to restore order quickly following any instances of communal violence, although some may not implement the changes to the citizenship law.
The security situation in the state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) will remain a key concern in the early part of the forecast period. The government's decision in August 2019 to revoke the special status accorded to the state sparked protests. Despite the deployment of large numbers of troops and the arrest of many local leaders, further unrest cannot be ruled out. We expect security risks in the area to remain high in the medium term. Any attempt by protesters to destabilise the region is likely to face a heavy-handed response from the government, including the use of internet shutdowns, curfews and riot-control forces. The government's move has also increased the risk of related terrorist attacks by separatist forces in major Indian cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch The next general election is expected to be held around May 2024. The focus before then will be to gauge support for the BJP in the state assembly elections. However, the results of recent state elections suggest that voters treat state and national elections differently, and that local issues tend to be more important. We believe that the BJP will perform poorly in the state election in Bihar later in the year.
In the Rajya Sabha (the upper house), the BJP and its allies form the largest grouping, although they command fewer than half the total number of seats. Assuming that the BJP retains control of key state assemblies and wins control of a few more in the next few years, the party and its allies within the larger National Democratic Alliance (NDA) could secure a simple majority in the upper house. This will enable the alliance to pass legislation without opposition approval. However, it will struggle to win the two-thirds majority needed to make constitutional changes unchallenged.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations Tensions with Pakistan will be exacerbated by the Indian government's move in August to revoke the special status granted to J&K. Shortly after the revocation was announced, Pakistan downgraded its diplomatic ties with India, and India responded in kind. We expect relations to remain strained, but do not anticipate a complete breakdown of diplomatic ties. We believe that Pakistan's military will increase its support for militant groups in Indian-controlled Kashmir in the short term. This will raise the risk of terrorist attacks by non-state actors there. Although small-scale military exchanges between the two countries are likely to occur in 2020-24, we believe that the two governments will ensure that these do not escalate into a full-blown conflict.
The US president, Donald Trump, will visit India on February 24th-25th. The chance of a trade deal being signed is low following a recent increase in trade tensions between the two countries. However, some progress is likely to be made on the defence front. A coming limited trade deal between the US and India may address impending issues between the two countries, but it will not solve systemic structural trade conflict. In general, ties will remain cordial, underpinned by a mutual desire to counter China's growing influence.
China's sway in South Asia and its close ties with Pakistan will remain a bone of contention between China and India. Despite some attempts at a reset of bilateral ties in recent years, territorial disputes between China and India will persist, and relations will remain tense in 2020-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends The BJP government will enjoy considerable flexibility in determining the policy agenda, given its majority in the Lok Sabha. One priority will be to inject momentum into its divestment programme. The government expects to collect Rs1.2trn (US$16.8bn) of divestment income in fiscal year 2020/21 (April-March). The plan will also help to liberalise some sectors. However, given weakness in business sentiment and the balance sheets of some state-owned enterprises, we do not believe that the government's ambitious divestment target will be met.
We maintain our view that incentives will be offered to four key labour-intensive sectors: tourism, construction, gems and jewellery, and garments and textiles. However, these incentives will be market-distorting, protectionist and a point of contention with countries such as the US in 2020-24. More positively for India's economic productivity, the government plans to liberalise foreign investment restrictions in sectors including insurance, the media and aviation.
The government is unlikely to push for radical reforms that are politically contentious, such as a comprehensive overhaul of land-acquisition laws or labour regulations. However, piecemeal changes to such legislation, such as the relaxation of certain regulatory requirements, could be undertaken. Nevertheless, we expect only limited gains from this, as the Modi administration will be hesitant to push ahead with productivity-enhancing reforms that could be politically damaging.
Infrastructure projects-particularly pet projects of the Modi government, such as the National infrastructure Pipeline and the Smart Cities Mission-remain a priority, partly in response to the rapid pace of urbanisation and partly to boost the business environment. However, many projects will face financing difficulties, as they involve a level of public-private partnership that seems unlikely to be realised, given how subdued private investment activity remains.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy Amid sluggish growth and budget constraints, the government announced a conservatively expansionary budget for 2020/21. It included the simplification of income tax for individuals in certain income groups. Notably, the government abolished the dividend distribution tax in an attempt to bolster investment spending.
We have revised our fiscal forecasts for 2020/21 and expect the deficit to widen to the equivalent of 3.7% of GDP (our previous forecast was 3.5% of GDP). This change is primarily attributable to our belief that progress on its divestment plan will be slow and that the government will miss its targets for both divestment income and total revenue. Moreover, we would caution against reliance on divestment income, which is an unsustainable revenue stream, to plug the fiscal hole. As the economy recovers, the government will attempt to consolidate the fiscal finances, leading to an improvement in the budget deficit to 3.1% of GDP by 2022/23. Spending pressures will increase thereafter in the run-up to the parliamentary election in 2024, resulting in a widening of the budget deficit from 2023/24. Our forecast assumes an absence of significant tax cuts in 2020/21-2023/24.
Efforts to deepen the tax base and increase levels of tax compliance will, nevertheless, continue over the forecast period; India's tax/GDP ratio remains relatively low compared with those of its regional peers. Welfare payments and infrastructure spending will remain key areas of focus for the administration, which will seek to expand public welfare schemes. We also expect subsidies for labour-intensive small-scale businesses, particularly those that are export-focused, in an effort to promote exports and employment. We believe that the government will succeed in raising tax compliance, which will help to prevent a significant swelling in the budget deficit as a proportion of GDP during the forecast period.
This federal fiscal picture does not reflect the large deficits of several state governments, which are not included in the national figure. The deep deficits in some states, such as Himachal Pradesh (4.4% of GDP), will present implicit liabilities for the central government and could pose downside risks to GDP growth over the next five years by crowding out private investment.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) will maintain inflation-targeting as the cornerstone of its monetary policy framework. It seeks to contain consumer price inflation within a 2-6% range, and close to a target of 4%, throughout 2020-24. However, strong political pressure on the RBI-which has forced out two hawkish heads of the bank under BJP rule-means that inflation is more likely to trend above 4% than below it.
We anticipate that accelerating consumer price inflation in the first half of 2020 will challenge the RBI's adherence to its inflation-targeting regime. However, it will be keen to support economic growth and to keep its policy rate unchanged rather than embark on a policy-tightening cycle. The RBI has also created a long-term repo operation and tweaked the regulatory framework to facilitate the transmission of its accommodative monetary policy. The central bank will, nevertheless, undertake some tightening in 2021-22 as demand-side pressures associated with the country's rapid economic growth build. As the pace of growth moderates in 2023-24, the RBI will return to a neutral stance.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth Real GDP grew by an average of 4.8% year on year in April-September 2019 (the first half of 2019/20). This compares with growth of 7.5% in the same period of the previous fiscal year and is the slowest rate of increase recorded for the first half of any fiscal year since 2001. Weak consumer sentiment and tepid investment were the main reasons for the slowdown. We expect the economy to grow by an average of 5% in the second half of 2019/20, bolstered by the positive effects of monetary policy easing that was adopted earlier in the year and fiscal stimulus measures adopted in September 2019. Overall, we expect the economy to grow by 4.9% in 2019/20. Growth in private consumption will be constrained by a strong pick-up in consumer price inflation, which will reduce consumers' purchasing power.
The effects of successive cuts to the RBI's policy interest rate in 2019 will continue to be felt at the start of 2020/21. This, coupled with the lingering effects of September's fiscal stimulus measures, will help to underpin growth. However, an outbreak of the novel coronavirus in parts of Asia adds uncertainty over sluggish exports and manufacturing (although India would tend to be less affected, as its economy is not as export-oriented as those of its peers). We forecast that real GDP growth will average 6.3% per year in 2021/22-2024/25. An anticipated tightening of monetary policy in 2021-22 will weigh on business and consumer sentiment; however, the rapid pace of real GDP growth warrants the adoption of a tightening stance. Progress on structural reforms will be too slow to give real GDP a significant boost.
In factor-cost terms, the services sector will remain the largest component of the economy and will grow at a relatively brisk pace over the forecast period. Conversely, manufacturing will remain below potential, owing to structural limitations in areas such as land acquisition. Meanwhile, the agriculture sector's contribution to GDP will continue to decrease over the forecast period. Public investment in agriculture will be aimed at short-term gains rather than fostering improved productivity.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation We expect consumer prices to increase by an average of 5.7% in 2020 as a whole, compared with 3.7% in 2019. Price pressures will abate from the second half of this year as forthcoming harvests boost food supplies. Our forecast assumes a normal monsoon this year (and in every year of the outlook period).
The adoption of a tighter monetary policy stance by the RBI in late 2021 will offset the inflationary impact of continued strengthening in oil prices in 2022, keeping average consumer price growth steady at 3.5%, just below the midpoint of the RBI's 2-6% target range. As oil prices stabilise in 2023-24 and the central bank accords a higher priority to containing inflationary pressures, consumer price inflation is expected to ease to an annual average of 3.2%.
The increasing cost of raw materials will drive up producer price inflation slightly in 2020, to 2.2%. As prices for oil and other commodities strengthen, producer price inflation will firm to an average of 3.6% in 2021-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates The RBI's adoption of a fairly aggressive loosening stance in 2019, along with high political risks associated with the removal of J&K's special constitutional status and changes to the citizenship law, have weighed on the exchange rate. We forecast that the rupee will depreciate on an annual average basis to Rs70.6:US$1 in 2020. However, the rate of depreciation will be shallow as the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank) loosens monetary policy further.
In 2021 we expect the rupee to appreciate slightly to an average of Rs70.3:US$1, owing to the RBI's tightening efforts, which will lead to policy divergence with the Fed. The rupee will depreciate in 2022-23 amid rising oil prices. We expect the currency to appreciate slightly in 2024, owing to an easing of external payment pressures. However, the country's real effective exchange rate will remain relatively stable during our forecast period, and benefits to India's export sector from the rupee's weakening against the US dollar will therefore be limited.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector Stronger investment from 2020 and higher oil prices from 2021 will increase the import bill, causing the trade deficit to widen. Merchandise export growth will be tempered by supply-chain disruptions caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus in China, but is expected to rebound in 2021 amid a pick-up in global commerce. However, India's export manufacturing sector will be held back by restrictive labour laws and difficulties in securing land for production facilities.
Increased competition from other countries and changing industrial trends will weigh on the pace of growth in India's main service export sectors, particularly business process outsourcing and information technology. Nevertheless, the services balance will remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, making a positive contribution to the current account. Owing to the large shortfall on merchandise trade, however, the current account will remain in deficit, narrowing to 1% of GDP in 2021 before widening to 1.4% of GDP in 2023-24.
Inward direct investment will remain strong in 2020-24, as the expanding economy and growing consumer demand provide opportunities for businesses. We expect annual direct investment inflows to rise to US$60bn by 2024, from an estimated US$46.8bn in 2019. Inward portfolio investment slid into negative territory in July-August 2019, owing to the imposition of higher taxes on foreign institutional investors. These tax changes were later rolled back as part of the government's efforts to revive the economy. We therefore expect these inflows to remain positive in 2020-24 as investor confidence is restored.

Full text: - Despite the country's socioeconomic collapse, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, will retain power throughout the 2020-24 forecast period. On this basis, we expect continued deterioration of the economy, sustained outward migration, and a poorer and more violent Venezuela. Despite US sanctions (and their impact on oil production), the Maduro regime has managed internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through its strict control over the security forces.
- The scale of the socioeconomic collapse and the elevated level of political instability will ensure that the Maduro regime continues to be challenged economically and politically. We do not expect the US government to renew waivers on Chevron and other US oil companies in July. This, together with the latest sanctions on Rosneft Trading (a subsidiary of the Russian-controlled oil giant) will lower global demand for Venezuelan crude and, in turn, force a reduction in domestic crude production over the coming quarters. Moreover, given that it will lose control over the legislature in 2021, the opposition will be under strong pressure in 2020 to step up its efforts to oust the regime. Mr Maduro will continue to face challenges to maintain the current patronage system and remain in control.
- The government has recently allowed the official exchange rate to float, which has alleviated pressures on its foreign-exchange reserves. Furthermore, de facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding, which aids price stability and therefore increases the availability of some basic goods. These measures are not a product of economic orthodoxy, but of policy decisions to ensure the regime's survival. We do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that will be required to resolve the economic crisis within the forecast period.

- Venezuela comes in 82nd of 82 countries globally in the business environment rankings for 2020-24, from 80th in the 2015-19 historical period, as the economic crisis deepens despite minor improvements. Reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment are unlikely.

Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: Limited rollback of interventionist measures, such as price controls. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition.
2022-24: Contract rights remain subdued, and red tape and ad hoc interventionism continue.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Most attempts to attract investment prove unsuccessful, owing to political instability.
2022-24: Actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights deteriorate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: Currency controls are made less opaque, but restrictions remain on private-sector access to foreign currency.
2022-24: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves, albeit slowly.
Taxes 2020-21: Risk of further unrest and political instability reduces probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major rise in public spending.
2022-24: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2020-21: Inflation remains high, and concerns surrounding economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2022-24: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2020-21: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Past emigration of skilled labour creates skills shortages.
2022-24: Labour-market rigidities persist, despite some increase in flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2020-21: Underinvestment in water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts. New government undertakes some repairs to the power network.
2022-24: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but risk of water and electricity rationing remains.
Technological readiness 2020-21: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment.
2022-24: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013 proved unsuccessful. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his own popularity plummet as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices, combined with strict sanctions on trade from the US, has plunged the country into a severe economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature to be in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports, and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$20.9bn in 2018 as the destruction of domestic supply led to increasing import dependence. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates the 2018 current-account surplus at 3.6% of GDP.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that the military regime led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) will retain power, despite severe economic and international pressure. Mr Maduro has remained in office amid a deepening humanitarian crisis in what is becoming a much less populous and much poorer country. The imposition of US sanctions has taken a dramatic economic toll on Venezuela, in particular by causing a collapse in oil production. However, in recent quarters a shift towards Asian markets has provided some stability to oil production, as has support from Russia and Cuba to circumvent US sanctions. In addition, the regime continues to benefit from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities. These sources of US dollars have prevented sanctions from fatally wounding the regime's patronage system. It is this patronage-along with strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces (and purges within its ranks)-that has allowed the regime to manage internal dissent.
The opposition led by the president of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, has lost the momentum that it held in early 2019 after abortive dialogue efforts and, in particular, after a failed uprising in April. International pressure has plateaued as the Lima Group (a multilateral body of mostly Latin American nations set up in 2017 to discuss the situation in Venezuela) and the Organisation of American States seem to have exhausted most of their diplomatic ammunition.
US sanctions remain a source of pressure: in February the US imposed sanctions on Rosneft Trading, a subsidiary of the Russian-controlled oil giant. These fresh sanctions will add further pressure to the regime's internal finances. However, this is somewhat offset by continued large-scale emigration, which has benefited the regime. The exodus has eased pressure on Mr Maduro and increasing inflows of workers' remittances provide the regime with hard currency. Furthermore, the population has grown protest-weary, and the economy has stabilised in relative terms. De facto dollarisation has brought about an improvement in price stability and, combined with a de facto lifting of price and foreign-exchange controls, has increased the availability of some basic goods.
Although it is not part of our baseline forecast, we recognise that there is still a high risk of some sort of political transition. There are three main paths to this-military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We assess the prospect of military action, by the US or Colombia, as low. Although a return to the negotiating table is possible, we believe that trust issues on both sides are insurmountable and therefore do not expect a negotiated solution to Venezuela's crisis. We believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The risks of such a political transition will be particularly high in 2020. We expect the US administration led by Donald Trump to refuse to grant an additional sanctions waiver to Chevron and other US oil services firms in July. This will further weaken oil production in the short to medium term and test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks. Perhaps most important, however, is the fact that the opposition will lose control of the National Assembly-the only remaining legitimate body-in January 2021, assuming that the regime engineers rigged elections in late 2020. Without such power, the possibility of a transition towards an opposition-led or mixed administration would plummet. Mr Maduro understands that the legislature's (and therefore Mr Guaidó's) power depends on its legitimacy, which explains why the regime sought to hijack the annual election of the speaker of the National Assembly in early January. Mr Guaidó was ultimately reselected as leader of the legislature, maintaining his legitimate claim as head of the executive branch for a second consecutive year.
Mr Guaidó and the opposition will be under pressure to try to force a regime change before the forthcoming elections; the prospect of the PSUV clinging to power permanently could prove a trigger for a renewed popular uprising. In such an environment, and if sanctions bite further, pragmatists within the government and the military could finally turn on Mr Maduro, paving the way for some sort of political transition. The country's crumbling infrastructure could also act as a trigger for regime change. A particularly dry summer (January-April) could exacerbate what is already likely to be a difficult season in 2020, leading to severe electricity and water shortages, with the prospect of protests against the regime.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch On the assumption that the Maduro regime clings to power, legislative elections will take place in December. These elections will be neither free nor fair, and the opposition will lose control of the National Assembly. If the opposition were to secure some sort of political change in 2020, the interim government would pursue deep-seated reforms to the electoral authority and attempt to hold a vote within 12 months of its formation, although achieving this would be a major challenge.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations Mr Guaidó has marshalled strong support from the international community, but efforts by most governments in Latin America (under the Lima Group banner) to support him have reached an impasse. Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, the US, has instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions and has openly called for the Venezuelan military to accept him in place of Mr Maduro. The latest US sanctions on Rosneft Trading seek to further complicate transacting Venezuelan crude oil. The US expects sanctions to put enough pressure on the regime's finances (and thus on its patronage system) so that Mr Maduro is forced to hold free and fair elections. The US also warned of additional sanctions in the near future. We expect the US not to renew waivers in July that would allow Chevron and other US oil companies to continue operating in Venezuela. The US administration will remain hawkish in its approach to foreign policy, but we believe that a military intervention is unlikely, given Mr Trump's aversion to such adventurism. However, if tensions rise and political violence increases, the possibility of smaller-scale interventions cannot be discounted.
Both Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the financing-amounting to tens of billions of US dollars per year-required to stabilise the economy and secure the long-term future of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries, but seems to have had little success in securing finance for investment. Russia is helping PDVSA to circumvent US sanctions (and profiting from it); however, we believe that Venezuela is increasingly becoming a liability for the Russian government. If a transition from the Maduro regime were to come about, we believe that Russia and China would be willing to work with Mr Maduro's successor to protect their current investments.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends Given our view that Mr Maduro will retain power for the duration of our 2020-24 forecast period, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that are required to resolve the economic crisis. In recent months, there has been evidence of attempts to tighten monetary policy in order to rein in hyperinflation and abandon foreign-exchange controls (official exchange rates are in line with the black market). De facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding; although this was not a tacit goal for the regime, Mr Maduro now welcomes it. De facto elimination of a host of controls is also occurring and has had a beneficial impact on the availability of goods. Other under-the-radar adjustments are possible in the coming years, as long as these benefit the survival of the regime. Such efforts alone are unlikely to bring about economic stability, owing to the absence of a comprehensive microeconomic reform or improvements in the rule of law, and policy predictability will not be forthcoming under the present regime. In this environment, domestic supply will be persistently weak.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy The authorities have not published complete data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect the non-financial public-sector deficit to narrow sharply in 2020, and the public debt/GDP ratio to remain high in the coming years. The sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will curb government spending. The regime relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Money printing will continue to finance the government's deficits in 2020-24. However, growing remittance inflows and the collapse of domestic demand will partly offset the need to monetise budget deficits. At present we assume no debt restructuring during the forecast period. The country's weak fiscal position is complicated by the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) that understates the true size of total public liabilities.
All of the sovereign's outstanding global bonds are in arrears. However, bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy shifts or a change in government. The key PDVSA 2020 bond, which was secured using 50.1% of the shares of Citgo (PDVSA's US subsidiary) as collateral, fell due at end-October 2019 and was not paid. A US federal appeals court has ruled that PDVSA is an "alter ego" of the Venezuelan government, which will have far-reaching implications. For example, a Canadian mining firm, Crystallex, is seeking to seize shares of Citgo stock. However, the US, which does not recognise Mr Maduro as the legitimate president, currently considers Citgo and its Caribbean facilities to be under Mr Guaidó's purview. As a result, the latest sanctions from the US Treasury department include provisions forbidding the transfer of Venezuelan assets, thus shielding Citgo assets from seizure by creditors. We expect the Trump administration to keep these measures in place during 2020. However, once the PSUV retakes control of the (currently legitimate) National Assembly, Citgo assets will no longer be safeguarded. Furthermore, despite being in default on all its global bonds, the Maduro regime might seek to cut unorthodox deals with bondholders, such as debt-for-oil arrangements.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) to print money in the short term. A significant increase in reserve requirements for the banking sector since the start of 2019 and a strong contraction in domestic demand have had a temporary steadying effect, which slowed hyperinflationary pressures in 2019; we expect this trend to continue this year. Nevertheless, the underlying causes of inflation remain unaddressed. Hyperinflation has quickened the pace of dollarisation of the economy (more than 50% of transactions are now thought to be conducted in US dollars). We believe that Venezuela is heading towards overall de facto dollarisation. Monthly inflation will rise again in the short term and will remain substantial. However, given the effect of dollarisation on price stability, we do not expect a return to the extremely high rates of annual inflation of more than 1,000,000% experienced in 2018.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 36.2% in 2019 (and a cumulative contraction of almost 70% since 2013), we expect a further decline of 20.5% in 2020. This will be driven by weaker private demand, owing to falling real incomes, continued migration, and-most importantly-a further contraction in oil output. We forecast that economic growth in 2021-24 will contract at an average annual rate of 4.5%-a more moderate rate of decline than in previous years, assuming a stabilisation of oil output. Private consumption will contract further in 2020 as unemployment, violence and falling incomes continue to force mass emigration, further weakening domestic demand.
In addition to the latest sanctions on Rosneft, we forecast that the US will prohibit Chevron and other American oil companies from operating in Venezuela. These moves will weaken demand for Venezuelan crude and prompt PDVSA to reduce its oil production. Although some volatility is envisaged, we expect oil output to decline gradually to 600,000 barrels/day by end-2020. In the medium term, we expect oil output to continue to fall-albeit more gradually-owing to serious operational problems (such as difficulties in obtaining equipment for repairs or in finding qualified staff) and to a limited pool of suitable buyers of Venezuelan crude. Export volumes will start to recover marginally in 2022-24, on the back of moderately higher global oil prices, and as producers become more accustomed to the new post-sanctions export markets. In addition, import compression will continue, which means that net exports will partly offset chronically weak internal demand.
There are substantial risks to our forecasts, which are based on the assumption that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout our forecast period. In the event of a transition, there would be upside risks to our medium-term baseline; the degree of this improvement would depend on the characteristics of the transition and on the new government's macroeconomic programme.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation Severely reduced domestic supply, currency constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official inflation data were published recently by the BCV, but there is a significant divergence between these figures and data from other sources. Amid persistent questions regarding the data, we will for now continue to use the monthly series produced by the National Assembly. Dollarisation and the regime's heavy restrictions on credit will cause inflation to come down from the hyperinflationary rates of recent years. Nevertheless, inflation will remain high for as long as the Maduro regime is in power, given huge fundamental imbalances between supply and demand, as well as the need for the regime to monetise its fiscal deficits. Weather-related shocks are a perennial risk to the inflation outlook.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency denomination (as in March 2018) or the introduction of a new currency is a strong possibility, although the exact nature of such a move is hard to forecast. With few foreign reserves left to protect, the Maduro regime announced a loosening of currency controls in mid-2019. Although this is a positive move, access to US dollars via formal means is limited, as significant barriers remain in place that, in practice, restrict access to dollars. We continue to believe that the government will maintain a number of indirect controls on the foreign-exchange market. In this environment, a black-market exchange-rate premium is inevitable. On February 17th the official exchange rate was BsS73,380:US$1, compared with a black-market rate of BsS77,142:US$1. The premium (currently at 5%) is small by historical comparison.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector The BCV's official figures for 2017-18 show that Venezuela posted current-account surpluses in this period, on the back of higher non-oil exports than we had expected. In 2019 the collapse of goods export earnings (owing to US sanctions on the oil trade) hit the trade balance hard. Nevertheless, based on the latest data, we estimate that the current account remained in surplus as a result of growing inflows of workers' remittances and the non-payment of interest on bonded debt (saving in excess of US$5bn in 2019). A continuation of these trends will allow Venezuela to post a current-account surplus in 2020 as well.
We expect the current account to remain in surplus during the forecast period, averaging 4.1% of GDP in 2021-24. The trade surplus will recover gradually as international oil prices increase moderately and the country steps up exports to Asian markets. This recovery will be supported by continued weakness in domestic demand, rising remittances from abroad and the fact that the sovereign will remain in default throughout the forecast period.

Full text: - The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government to serve out its second five-year term, which expires in 2024. We expect the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to run a highly centralised administration in 2020-24.
- Relations with the US will remain warm in 2020-24; trade tension will ease in the early part of the forecasting period as the two countries strive to ratify a limited trade deal. Despite efforts to normalise relations, ties with China will remain strained, owing to border disputes and concerns about that country's rising influence in South Asia. Bilateral relations with Pakistan will also remain strained in 2020-24. Small-scale military exchanges cannot be ruled out, but we do not expect outright hostilities.
- The budget deficit will remain wide as a percentage of GDP in fiscal year 2020/21-24/25 (April-March), as the government will continue to spend heavily on infrastructure and subsidy payments. However, we do not expect it to implement additional fiscal stimulus.
- Real GDP growth will slump to 4.9% in 2019/20, owing to a slowdown in private consumption and infrastructure investment. Economic growth will recover to an annual average of 6.3% in 2020/21-2024/25.
- We expect consumer price inflation to approach the upper bound of the central bank's 2-6% target range in 2020. The key driver will be a sustained recovery in domestic demand, as well as lagged agricultural production. Inflation will then stabilise below 4% in 2021-24, because of the tightening cycle embarked upon by the Reserve Bank of India (the central bank). Our forecasts assume normal monsoons.
- The rupee is forecast to depreciate slightly against the US dollar in 2020, averaging Rs70.6:US$1. The currency will remain weak in 2021-24, owing to a persistent current-account deficit and high domestic inflation.
- India will remain dependent on imports for its fuel and capital goods needs. The merchandise trade deficit will therefore widen during the forecast period. Business process outsourcing and information technology will remain the key service export sectors in 2020-24.

Country forecast overview: India's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: The government takes steps towards partial privatisation of some state-owned companies.
2022-24: The government continues to rationalise liquidation and bankruptcy laws to simplify the closure of loss-making businesses or merger-and-acquisition activity involving other corporate entities.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Restrictions on foreign investment in multi-brand retail are partially removed.
2022-24: Foreign investment in export manufacturing increases markedly, albeit in only a few regions.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: India and the US ratify a limited trade deal. Bilateral tensions ease as the countries move towards the implementation stage.
2022-24: Full capital-account convertibility remains off the policy agenda.
Taxes 2020-21: Rationalisation of the goods and services tax (GST) continues, resulting in a reduction in the number of tax bands.
2022-24: Alcohol and petroleum products remain outside the scope of the goods and services tax (GST).
Financing 2020-21: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) relaxes regulatory norms for debt-laden banks, raising risks to banking sector stability but improving the availability of finance for corporate borrowers.
2022-24: Private-sector banks account for a rising share of total lending, while bad issues persist in public-sector banks.
The labour market 2020-21: Reforms to labour laws move at a glacial pace owing to obstruction by trade unions and opposition groups.
2022-24: Some labour reforms make headway at state level. However, reforms at central-government level remain stuck, owing to a lack of political consensus behind the changes.
Infrastructure 2020-21: The government increases its budgetary allocation for projects such as the Bharatmala road connectivity scheme.
2022-24: Construction of a high-speed rail link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad continues, but the project misses its targeted completion date of August 2022.
Technological readiness 2020-21: Most technological innovation continues to be concentrated in a few clusters, such as Bangalore. Expenditure on research and development as a proportion of GDP remains low by regional standards.
2022-24: The government makes efforts to digitise the delivery of public services, in an effort to cut corruption and promote the efficiency of "last-mile delivery" for such services.

a Actual.
Background: India gained independence in 1947 after two centuries of British colonial rule. Partition at the same time created the state of Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars (two of them over the disputed territory of Kashmir). India is the second-most populous country in the world, with an estimated 1.35bn people in 2018, according to the UN. Its economy was the third-largest in the world in 2018 when measured in nominal US dollars or by purchasing power parity exchange rates.
Political structure: India has been a democracy since independence. At federal level, the Bharatiya Janata Party holds a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), although it governs in a broader coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). India follows the UK model of parliamentary government, with a prime minister as head of government. It has a president as the head of state. The country has a quasi-federal structure, with state governments having their own legislatures and enjoying a fair degree of freedom.
Policy issues: Progress on economic reform is constrained by a lack of consensus across the political spectrum over its nature and scope, and by a lack of will within the government to undertake politically risky structural reforms. The NDA administration has made headway in speeding up infrastructure projects, and this will remain a priority in the next five years. However, progress on more contentious issues, such as land and labour reforms, will be slight.
Taxation: The government will maintain efforts to broaden the tax base in 2020-24, including by further digitising tax departments. This, coupled with strong economic growth, will support a pick-up in tax collection. Despite some reforms, including the introduction of a nationwide goods and services tax in 2017, India's tax system will remain highly complex.
Foreign trade: India's trade deficit widened to US$186.7bn in 2018, from US$148.1bn in 2017, while its surplus on the services account rose from US$75.9bn to US$80.8bn.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the majority of seats in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) in the general election that took place in April-May 2019. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any threat to the BJP's domination of the central government at any point during its full term (2019-24). This will ensure continuity in policy, particularly as this is the second consecutive term for the BJP.
The results of the 2019 election were testament to the popularity of the prime minister, Narendra Modi. He will remain the dominant figure in the government. Decision-making will remain centralised around the prime minister's office (PMO) and key ministers and officials whom Mr Modi trusts. The PMO and the national security advisor, Ajit Doval, played a key role in the outgoing government, and we believe that they will continue to dominate the policy agenda in the next five years.
Social unrest will pose a threat to political stability during the forecast period. Clashes between religious groups will intensify in states with a history of communal violence, such as Uttar Pradesh and Assam. In contrast to the country's current secular constitution, several far-right groups, including some affiliated with the BJP, have long been pushing for India to be recast as a Hindu nation-a view that puts them at odds with minority groups, notably Muslims. Violent protests are continuing across India following the enactment in December of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019, with some fearing that the change will erode secularism and others concerned about unchecked immigration. State governments (which control the local police in India) will be keen to restore order quickly following any instances of communal violence, although some may not implement the changes to the citizenship law.
The security situation in the state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) will remain a key concern in the early part of the forecast period. The government's decision in August 2019 to revoke the special status accorded to the state sparked protests. Despite the deployment of large numbers of troops and the arrest of many local leaders, further unrest cannot be ruled out. We expect security risks in the area to remain high in the medium term. Any attempt by protesters to destabilise the region is likely to face a heavy-handed response from the government, including the use of internet shut-downs, curfews and riot-control forces. The government's move has also increased the risk of related terrorist attacks by separatist forces in major Indian cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch The next general election is expected to be held around May 2024. The focus before then will be to gauge support for the BJP in the state assembly elections. However, the results of recent state elections suggest that voters treat state and national elections differently, and that local issues tend to be more important. We believe that the BJP will perform poorly in the upcoming state elections in Delhi (February) and Bihar (later in the year).
In the Rajya Sabha (the upper house), the BJP and its allies form the largest grouping, although they command fewer than half the total number of seats. Assuming that the BJP retains control of key state assemblies and wins control of a few more in the next few years, the party and its allies within the larger National Democratic Alliance (NDA) could secure a simple majority in the upper house. This will enable the alliance to pass legislation without opposition approval. However, it will struggle to win the two-thirds majority needed to make constitutional changes unchallenged.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations Tensions with Pakistan will be exacerbated by the Indian government's move in August to revoke the special status granted to J&K. Shortly after the revocation was announced, Pakistan downgraded its diplomatic ties with India, and India responded in kind. We expect relations to remain strained, but do not anticipate a complete breakdown of diplomatic ties. We believe that Pakistan's military will increase its support for militant groups in Indian-controlled Kashmir in the short term. This will raise the risk of terrorist attacks by non-state actors there. Although small-scale military exchanges between the two countries are likely to occur in 2020-24, we believe that the two governments will ensure that these do not escalate into a full-blown conflict.
A coming limited trade deal between the US and India may address impending issues between the two countries, but it will not solve systemic structural trade conflict. In general, ties will remain cordial, underpinned by a mutual desire to counter China's growing influence.
China's sway in South Asia and its close ties with Pakistan will remain a bone of contention between China and India. Despite some attempts at a reset of bilateral ties in recent years, territorial disputes between China and India will persist, and relations will remain tense in 2020-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends The BJP government will enjoy considerable flexibility in determining the policy agenda, given its majority in the Lok Sabha. One area of priority will be resolving bad debt problems in the banking sector that have held back lending to business. In the budget delivered in July 2019, the government announced plans to provide Rs700bn (US$10bn) to help to shore up public-sector banks in fiscal year 2019/20 (April-March). We believe that this sum will help to address balance-sheet problems. It will also improve liquidity in the banking sector. However, given weak business sentiment, this initiative is unlikely to have led to a significant increase in lending.
We expect incentives to be offered to four key labour-intensive sectors: tourism, construction, gems and jewellery, and garments and textiles. However, these incentives will be market-distorting, protectionist and a point of contention with countries such as the US in 2020-24. More positively for India's economic productivity, the government plans to liberalise foreign investment restrictions in sectors including insurance, the media and aviation.
The government is unlikely to push for radical reforms that are politically contentious, such as a comprehensive overhaul of land-acquisition laws or labour regulations. However, piecemeal changes to such legislation, such as the relaxation of certain regulatory requirements, could be undertaken. Nevertheless, we expect only limited gains from this, as the Modi administration will be hesitant to push ahead with productivity-enhancing reforms that could be politically damaging.
Infrastructure projects-particularly pet projects of the Modi government, such as the Bharatmala roads project and the Smart Cities Mission-will remain a priority, partly as a response to the rapid pace of urbanisation, and partly to boost the business environment. However, many projects will face financing difficulties, as they envision a level of public-private partnership that seems unlikely to be realised, given how subdued private investment activity remains.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy The government announced a slew of fiscal stimulus measures in August and September 2019 in response to weak GDP data for the second quarter of that year. The measures included initiatives for ailing sectors of the economy, such as automotive, banking and housing. Notably, the government also gave companies the option to pay corporate tax at a lower rate of 22% (25.2% including various surcharges), from 30% previously. This was backdated to the start of fiscal year 2019/20, in order to spur private-sector activity.
Fiscal stimulus measures and the revenue foregone owing to the corporate tax cut will leave a large hole in government finances. We expect the fiscal deficit to widen to the equivalent of 3.9% of GDP in 2019/20. As the economy recovers, the government will attempt to consolidate the fiscal finances, leading to an improvement in the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2022/23. Thereafter, spending pressures will increase in the run-up to the parliamentary election in 2024, resulting in a widening of the budget deficit in 2023/24. Our forecast assumes no more tax cuts in 2020/21-2023/24.
Efforts to deepen the tax base and increase levels of tax compliance will, nevertheless, continue over the forecast period; India's tax/GDP ratio remains relatively low compared with those of its regional peers. Welfare payments and infrastructure spending will remain key areas of focus for the government, which will seek to expand public welfare schemes. We also expect subsidies for labour-intensive small-scale businesses, particularly those that are export-focused, in an effort to promote exports and employment. We believe that the government will succeed in raising tax compliance, which will help to prevent a significant swelling in the budget deficit as a proportion of GDP during the forecast period.
This federal fiscal picture does not reflect the large deficits of several state governments, which are not included in the national figure. The deep deficits in some states, such as Punjab, will present implicit liabilities for the central government and could pose downside risks to GDP growth over the next five years by crowding out private investment.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) will maintain inflation-targeting as the cornerstone of its monetary policy framework. It seeks to contain consumer price inflation within a 2-6% range, and close to a target of 4%, throughout 2020-24. However, strong political pressure on the RBI-which has forced out two hawkish heads of the bank under BJP rule-means that inflation is more likely to trend above 4% than below it.
We anticipate that accelerating consumer price inflation in the first half of 2020 will challenge the RBI's adherence to its inflation-targeting regime. However, the central bank will be keen to support economic growth and keep its policy rate unchanged rather than embark on a policy-tightening cycle. It will, nevertheless, undertake some tightening in 2021-22 as demand-side pressures associated with the country's rapid economic growth build. As the pace of growth moderates in 2023-24, the RBI will return to a neutral stance.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth Real GDP grew by an average of 4.8% year on year in April-September 2019 (the first half of 2019/20). This compares with growth of 7.5% in the same period of the previous fiscal year and is the slowest rate of increase recorded for the first half of any fiscal year since 2001. Weak consumer sentiment and tepid invest-ment were the main reasons for the slowdown. We expect the economy to grow by an average of 5% in the second half of 2019/20, bolstered by the positive effects of monetary policy easing earlier in the year and fiscal stimulus measures adopted in September 2019. Overall, we expect the economy to grow by 4.9% in 2019/20. Growth in private consumption will be constrained by a strong pick-up in consumer price inflation, which will reduce consumers' purchasing power.
The effects of successive cuts to the RBI's policy interest rate in 2019 will continue to be felt at the start of 2020/21. This, coupled with the lingering effects of September's fiscal stimulus measures, will help to underpin growth. At the same time, a gradual recovery in global trade growth and brightening prospects for the global economy will help to lift exports and investment spending. We forecast that real GDP growth will average 6.4% per year in 2021/22-2024/25. An anticipated tightening of monetary policy in 2021-22 will weigh on business and consumer sentiment. However, the recovery will be at a sufficiently rapid pace to warrant the adoption of a tightening stance. Nevertheless, progress on structural reforms will be too slow to give real GDP a significant boost.
In factor-cost terms, the services sector will remain the largest component of the economy and will grow at a relatively brisk pace over the forecast period. Conversely, manufacturing will remain below potential, owing to structural limitations in areas such as land acquisition. Meanwhile, the agriculture sector's contribution to GDP will continue to decrease over the forecast period. Public investment in agriculture will be aimed at short-term gains rather than fostering improved productivity.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation We have revised our consumer inflation forecast for 2020, following a modest upward revision to our global oil price forecast for the year. We believe that the lingering adverse effects of an extended monsoon in 2019, which negatively affected crop yields, will exert upward pressure on overall prices in the early months of 2020. We now expect consumer prices to increase by an average of 5.7% for the year as a whole, compared with 4.7% previously. Our forecast assumes a normal monsoon this year (and in every year of the outlook period).
The adoption of a tighter monetary policy stance by the RBI in late 2021 will offset the inflationary impact of continued strengthening in oil prices in 2022, keeping average consumer price growth steady at 3.5%, just below the midpoint of the RBI's 2-6% target range. As oil prices stabilise in 2023-24 and the central bank accords a higher priority to containing inflationary pressures, consumer price inflation is expected to ease to an annual average of 3.2%.
The increasing cost of raw materials will drive up producer price inflation slightly in 2020, to 1.9%. As prices for oil and other commodities strengthen, producer price inflation will firm to an average of 3.6% in 2021-24.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates The RBI's adoption of a fairly aggressive loosening stance in 2019, along with high political risks associated with the removal of J&K's special constitutional status and changes to the citizenship law, have weighed on the exchange rate. We forecast that the rupee will depreciate on an annual average basis to Rs70.6:US$1 in 2020. However, the rate of depreciation will be shallow as the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank) loosens monetary policy further.
In 2021 we expect the rupee to appreciate slightly to an average of Rs70.3:US$1, owing to the RBI's tightening efforts, which will lead to policy divergence with the Fed. The rupee will depreciate in 2022-23 amid rising oil prices. We expect the currency to appreciate slightly in 2024, owing to an easing of external pay-ment pressures. However, the country's real effective exchange rate will remain relatively stable during our forecast period, and benefits to India's export sector from the rupee's weakening against the US dollar will therefore be limited.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector Stronger investment from 2020 and higher oil prices from 2021 will swell the import bill, resulting in a widening of the trade deficit. Merchandise exports will grow at a faster pace than imports over the next five years, but India's export manufacturing sector will be held back by restrictive labour laws and difficulties in securing land for production facilities.
Increased competition from other countries and changing industrial trends will weigh on the pace of growth in India's main service export sectors, particularly business process outsourcing and information technology. Nevertheless, the services balance will remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, making a positive contribution to the current account. Owing to the large shortfall on merchandise trade, however, the current account will remain in deficit, narrowing to 0.9% of GDP in 2021 before widening to 1.4% of GDP in 2023-24.
Inward direct investment will remain strong in 2020-24, as the expanding economy and growing consumer demand provide opportunities for businesses. We expect annual direct investment inflows to rise to US$60bn by 2024, from an estimated US$47bn in 2019. Inward portfolio investment slid into negative territory in July-August 2019, owing to the imposition of higher taxes on foreign institutional investors. These tax changes were later rolled back as part of the government's efforts to revive the economy. We therefore expect these inflows to remain positive in 2020-24 as investor confidence is restored.

Full text: - Despite the country's socioeconomic collapse, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, will retain power throughout 2020-24. On this basis, we expect continued deterioration of the economy, sustained outward migration, and a poorer and more violent Venezuela. Despite US sanctions, and their impact on oil production, the Maduro regime has managed internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through its strict control over the security forces.
- The scale of the socioeconomic collapse and the elevated level of political instability will ensure that the Maduro regime continues to be challenged economically and politically. We do not expect the US government to renew waivers on Chevron and other US oil companies in July 2020; this will destabilise crude production, at least in the short term. Moreover, given that it will lose control over the legislature in 2021, the opposition will be under strong pressure in 2020 to step up its efforts to oust the regime. Mr Maduro will continue to face challenges to maintain the current patronage system and remain in control.
- The government has recently allowed the official exchange rate to float, which has alleviated pressures on its foreign-exchange reserves. Furthermore, de facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding, which aids price stability and therefore increases the availability of some basic goods. These measures are not a product of economic orthodoxy, but of policy decisions to ensure the regime's survival. We do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms required to resolve the economic crisis within the forecast period.

- Venezuela is in 82nd position globally in the business environment rankings for 2020-24, down from 80th in the 2015-19 historical period, as the economic crisis deepens, despite minor improvements. Reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment are unlikely.

Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2020-21: Limited rollback of interventionist measures, such as price controls. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition.
2022-24: Contract rights remain subdued, and red tape and ad hoc interventionism continue.
Policy towards foreign investment 2020-21: Most attempts to attract investment prove unsuccessful, owing to political instability.
2022-24: Actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights deteriorate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2020-21: Currency controls are made less opaque, but restrictions remain on private-sector access to foreign currency.
2022-24: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves, albeit slowly.
Taxes 2020-21: Risk of further unrest and political instability reduces probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major rise in public spending.
2022-24: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2020-21: Inflation remains high, and concerns surrounding economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2022-24: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2020-21: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Past emigration of skilled labour creates skills shortages.
2022-24: Labour-market rigidities persist, despite some increase in flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2020-21: Underinvestment in water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts. New government undertakes some repairs to the power network.
2022-24: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but risk of water and electricity rationing remains.
Technological readiness 2020-21: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment.
2022-24: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013 proved unsuccessful. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his own popularity plummet as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices, combined with strict sanctions on trade from the US, has plunged the country into a severe economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature to be in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$20.9bn in 2018 as the destruction of domestic supply led to increasing import dependence. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates the 2018 current-account surplus at 3.6% of GDP.

Outlook for 2020-24: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that the military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), will retain power, despite severe economic and international pressure. Mr Maduro has remained in office amid a deepening humanitarian crisis in what is becoming a much less populous and much poorer country. The imposition of US sanctions has taken a dramatic economic toll on Venezuela, in particular by causing a collapse in oil production. However, in recent quarters a shift towards Asian markets has provided some stability to oil production, as has support from Russia and Cuba to circumvent US sanctions. In addition, the regime continues to benefit from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities. These sources of US dollar have prevented sanctions from fatally wounding the regime's patronage system. It is this patronage-along with strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces, and purges within its ranks-that has allowed the regime to manage internal dissent.
Internal and external efforts to oust Mr Maduro are fading. The opposition, led by the president of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, has lost the momentum that it held in early 2019 after abortive dialogue efforts and, in particular, after a failed uprising in April. International pressure has plateaued as the admini-stration of the US president, Donald Trump, has shifted its attention to the November 2020 US presidential election and to other foreign policy targets, chiefly Iran and China. Meanwhile the Lima Group (a multilateral body of mostly Latin American nations set up in 2017 to discuss the situation in Venezuela) and the Organisation of American States (OAS) seem to have exhausted most of their diplomatic ammunition. Large-scale emigration has also benefited Mr Maduro. The exodus has eased pressure on the Maduro regime, and increasing inflows of workers' remittances provide the regime with hard currency. Furthermore, the population has grown protest-weary, and the economy has stabilised in relative terms. De facto dollarisation has brought about an improvement in price stability and, combined with a de facto lifting of price and foreign-exchange controls, has increased the availability of some basic goods.
Although it is not part of our baseline forecast, we recognise that there is still a high risk of some sort of political transition. There are three main paths to this-military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We assess the prospect of military action, by the US or Colombia, as low. Although negotiations sponsored by Norway are likely to resume (it is unclear when), we believe that trust issues on both sides are insurmountable and therefore do not expect a negotiated solution to Venezuela's crisis. We believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The risks of such a political transition will be particularly high in 2020. We expect the Trump administration to refuse to grant an additional sanctions waiver to Chevron and other US oil services firms in July. This will again destabilise oil production in the short term and test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks. Perhaps most important, however, is the fact that the opposition will lose control of the National Assembly-the only remaining legitimate body-in January 2021, assuming that the regime engineers rigged elections in late 2020. Without such power, the possibility of a transition towards an opposition-led or mixed administration would plummet. Mr Maduro understands that the legislature's (and therefore Mr Guaidó's) power lies in being legitimate, which explains why the regime sought to hijack the annual election of the speaker of the National Assembly in early January. Mr Guaidó was ultimately reselected as head of the legislature, maintaining his legitimate claim as head of the executive branch for a second consecutive year.
Mr Guaidó and the opposition will be under pressure to try to force a regime change before the upcoming elections; the prospect of the PSUV clinging to power permanently could prove a trigger for a renewed popular uprising. In such an environment, and if sanctions bite further, pragmatists within the government and the military could finally turn on Mr Maduro, paving the way for some sort of political transition. The country's crumbling infrastructure could also act as a trigger for transition. A particularly dry summer (January-April) could exacerbate what is already likely to be a difficult season in 2020, leading to severe electricity and water shortages, with the prospect of protests against the regime.
Outlook for 2020-24: Election watch On the assumption that the Maduro regime clings to power, legislative elections will take place in December 2020. These elections will be neither free nor fair, so the opposition will lose control of the National Assembly. If the opposition were to secure some sort of political change in 2020, the interim government would pursue deep-seated reforms to the electoral authority and attempt to hold a vote within 12 months of its formation, although achieving this would be a major challenge.
Outlook for 2020-24: International relations Mr Guaidó has marshalled strong support from the international community, but efforts by most governments in Latin America (under the Lima Group banner) to support him have reached an impasse. Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, the US, has instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions and has openly called for the Venezuelan military to accept him in place of Mr Maduro. The most important of the US sanctions is a freeze on Venezuelan assets abroad, which will further complicate the regime's attempts to sustain the current patronage system; in September the US also introduced a travel ban on senior Venezuelan officials. Moreover, we expect waivers that allow Chevron and other US oil companies to continue operating in Venezuela not to be renewed in July 2020, given the approaching US presidential election. The US administration will remain hawkish in its approach to foreign policy, but we believe that a military intervention is unlikely, given Mr Trump's aversion to such adventurism. However, if tensions rise and political violence increases, the possibility of smaller-scale interventions cannot be discounted.
Both Russia and China seem unwilling to provide the financing-amounting to tens of billions of US dollars per year-required to stabilise the economy and secure the long-term future of PDVSA, the state oil company. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries, but seems to have had little success in securing finance for investment. Nonetheless, Russia is believed to be helping PDVSA to circumvent US sanctions (for a fee). However, Russia's interest in Venezuela is mainly geopolitical, not economic. If a transition from the Maduro regime were to come about, we believe that Russia and China would be willing to work with Mr Maduro's successor to protect their current investments.
Outlook for 2020-24: Policy trends Given our view that Mr Maduro will retain power for the duration of our forecast period, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that are required to resolve the economic crisis. In recent months there has been evidence of attempts to tighten monetary policy, in order to rein in hyperinflation and abandon foreign-exchange controls (official exchange rates are in line with the black market). De facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding; although this was not a tacit goal for the regime, Mr Maduro now welcomes it. De facto elimination of a host of controls is also occurring and has had a beneficial impact on the availability of goods. Other under-the-radar adjustments are possible in the coming years, as long as these benefit the survival of the regime. Such efforts alone are unlikely to bring about economic stability, owing to the absence of a comprehensive microeconomic reform or improvements in the rule of law, and policy predictability will not be forthcoming under the present regime. In this environment, domestic supply will be persistently weak.
Outlook for 2020-24: Fiscal policy The authorities have not published complete data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect the non-financial public-sector deficit to narrow sharply in 2020, and that the public debt/GDP ratio will remain high in the coming years. The sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will curb government spending. The government relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Money printing will continue to finance the government's deficits in 2020-24. However, growing remittance inflows and the collapse of domestic demand will partly offset the need to monetise budget deficits. At present we assume no debt restructuring during the forecast period. The country's weak fiscal position is complicated by the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) that understates the true size of total public liabilities.
All of the sovereign's outstanding global bonds are in arrears. However, bondholders are yet to go to the courts, perhaps waiting for news of policy shifts or a change in government. The key PDVSA 2020 bond, which was secured using 50.1% of the shares of Citgo (PDVSA's US subsidiary) as collateral, fell due at end-October 2019 and was not paid. A US federal appeals court has ruled that PDVSA is an "alter ego" of the Venezuelan government, which will have far-reaching implications. For example, a Canadian mining firm, Crystallex, is seeking to seize shares of Citgo stock. However, the US, which does not recognise Mr Maduro as the legitimate president, currently considers Citgo and its Caribbean facilities to be under Mr Guaidó's purview. As a result, the latest sanctions from the US Treasury department include provisions forbidding the transfer of Venezuelan assets, thus shielding Citgo assets from seizure by creditors. We expect the Trump administration to keep these measures in place during 2020. However, once the PSUV retakes control of the (currently legitimate) National Assembly, Citgo assets will no longer be safeguarded. Furthermore, despite being in default on all its global bonds, the Maduro regime might seek to cut unorthodox deals with bondholders, such as debt-for-oil arrangements.
Outlook for 2020-24: Monetary policy The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) to print money in the short term. A significant increase in reserve requirements for the banking sector since the start of 2019 and a strong contraction in domestic demand have had a temporary steadying effect, which slowed hyperinflationary pressures in 2019; we expect this trend to continue this year. Nevertheless, the underlying causes of inflation remain unaddressed. Hyperinflation has quickened the pace of dollarisation of the economy (more than 50% of transactions are now thought to be conducted in US dollars). We believe that Venezuela is heading towards overall de facto dollarisation. Monthly inflation will rise again in the short term and will remain substantial. However, given the effect of dollarisation on price stability, we do not expect a return to the extremely high rates of annual inflation of more than 1,000,000% experienced in 2018.
Outlook for 2020-24: Economic growth After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 36.2% in 2019 (and a cumulative contraction of almost 70% since 2013), we expect a further decline of 20.5% in 2020. This will be driven by weaker private demand, owing to falling real incomes, continued migration, and-most importantly-a further contraction in oil output. We forecast that economic growth in 2021-24 will contract at an average annual rate of 4.5%, a more moderate rate of decline than in previous years, assuming a stabilisation of oil output. Private consumption will contract further in 2020 as unemployment, violence and falling incomes continue to force mass migration, further weakening domestic demand.
We expect the US's decision to prohibit Chevron and other US oil companies from operating in Venezuela to curb oil production at the Petropiar joint venture (between Chevron and PDVSA) in the Orinoco Belt. The impact on oil production will be limited in the short term; after the ban PDVSA could take full control of the venture or assume joint control with other partners, most likely a Russian oil company, Rosneft. Even so, we expect oil output to slip to just 600,000 barrels/day in 2020. Under PDVSA control, crude production would fail to reach previous levels. In the medium term we expect oil output to continue to fall-albeit more gradually-owing to serious operational problems (such as difficulties in obtaining equipment for repairs or in finding qualified staff) and to a limited pool of suitable buyers of Venezuelan crude.
Export volumes will start to recover marginally in 2022-24, on the back of moderately higher global oil prices, and as producers become more accustomed to the new post-sanctions export markets. In addition, import compression will continue, which means that net exports will partly offset chronically weak internal demand.
There are substantial risks to our forecasts, which are based on the assumption that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout our forecast period. In the event of a transition, there would be upside risks to our medium-term baseline; the degree of this improvement would depend on the characteristics of the transition and on the new government's macroeconomic programme.
Outlook for 2020-24: Inflation Severely reduced domestic supply, currency constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official inflation data were published recently by the BCV, but there is a significant divergence between these figures and data from other sources. Amid continuing questions regarding the data, we will, for now, continue to use the monthly series produced by the National Assembly. Dollarisation and the regime's heavy restrictions on credit will cause inflation to come down from the hyper-inflationary rates of recent years. Nevertheless, inflation will remain high for as long as the Maduro regime is in power, given huge fundamental imbalances between supply and demand, as well as the need for the regime to monetise its fiscal deficits. Weather-related shocks are a perennial risk to the inflation outlook.
Outlook for 2020-24: Exchange rates Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency denomination (as in March 2018) or the introduction of a new currency is a strong possibility, although the exact nature of such a move is hard to forecast. With few foreign reserves left to protect, the Maduro regime announced a loosening of currency controls in mid-2019. Although this is a positive move, access to US dollars via formal means is limited, as significant barriers remain in place that in practice restrict access to dollars. We continue to believe that the government will maintain a number of indirect controls on the foreign-exchange market. In this environment, a black-market exchange-rate premium is inevitable. On January 24th the official exchange rate was BsS74,580:US$1, compared with a black-market rate of BsS77,102:US$1. The premium (currently at 3%) is small by historical comparison.
Outlook for 2020-24: External sector The BCV's official figures for 2017-18 show that Venezuela posted current-account surpluses in this period, on the back of higher non-oil exports than we had expected. In 2019 the collapse of goods export earnings (owing to US sanctions on the oil trade) hit the trade balance hard. Nevertheless, based on the latest data, we estimate that the current account remained in surplus as a result of growing inflows of workers' remittances and the non-payment of interest on bonded debt (saving in excess of US$5bn in 2019). A continuation of these trends will allow Venezuela to post a current-account surplus in 2020 as well.
We expect the current account to remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, averaging 4.2% of GDP in 2021-24. The trade surplus will recover gradually as international oil prices increase moderately and the country steps up exports to Asian markets. This recovery will be supported by continued weakness in domestic demand, rising remittances from abroad and the fact that the sovereign will remain in default throughout the forecast period.
