Abstract: [...]the country remains in 12th place in the regional ranking but loses two places in the global ranking, dropping to 21st. [...]we expect little progress on significant structural reforms, and the risk of an early election in the next parliamentary term is high. [...]we expect real GDP growth to accelerate to an upwardly revised 2.5% this year, slightly above growth in Germany for the first time since 2005. 2012a 2013a 2014a 2015a 2016a 2017b 2018b 2019b 2020b 2021b The labour market (av) Labour force (m) 3.7 3.8 3.8 3.9 3.9 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.1 4.1 Labour force (% change) 1.6 1.2 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.3 0.7 0.3 0.3 0.0 Employment (m) 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.7 3.7 3.8 3.8 Employment (% change) 1.3 0.5 0.6 0.9 1.5 1.9 1.3 0.9 0.6 0.5 Unemployment (m) 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 Unemployment rate (av; %; national measure) 7.0 7.6 8.4 9.1 9.1 8.6 8.1 7.6 7.3 6.8 Unemployment rate (av; %; EU/OECD standardised measure) 4.9 5.3 5.6 5.7 6.0 5.4 5.2 4.9 4.8 4.4 Wage and price inflation (% except labour costs per hour) GDP deflator 2.0 1.6 1.8 1.9 1.3 2.4 1.8 1.6 1.1 1.9 Consumer prices (av; EU harmonised measure) 2.6 2.1 1.5 0.8 1.0 2.0 1.8 2.0 2.1 2.1 Producer prices (av) 2.4 -1.1 -2.0 -3.6 -2.4 1.9 1.6 2.2 2.6 2.4 GDP deflator (av) 2.0 1.6 1.8 1.9 1.3 2.4 1.8 1.6 1.1 1.9 Private consumption deflator (av) 2.4 2.2 2.1 1.4 1.3 2.0 1.7 1.7 1.8 1.8 Government consumption deflator (av) 2.4 1.2 1.5 1.6 1.5 2.0 1.8 2.0 2.1 2.1 Fixed investment deflator (av) 2.2 1.6 1.5 1.6 1.0 1.2 1.5 1.8 1.7 1.7 Average nominal wages 3.3 2.6 2.4 2.2 1.6 1.7 2.1 2.5 2.6 2.7 Average real wages 0.7 0.4 0.9 1.3 0.6 -0.3 0.3 0.5 0.5 0.6 Unit labour costs ([euro]-based; av) 2.6 1.0 0.4 0.5 -0.3 -0.7 -0.4 -0.1 0.0 -0.1 Unit labour costs (US$-based) -5.2 4.3 0.5 -16.1 -0.6 -1.0 1.8 1.9 1.3 1.1 Labour costs per hour ([euro]) 32.3 33.1 34.0 34.8 35.4 36.1 36.9 37.9 39.0 40.1 Labour costs per hour (US$) 41.5 44.0 45.2 38.6 39.2 39.8 41.6 43.6 45.4 47.3 a Actual.b Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The grand coalition of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) fell apart in May 2017 following the resignation of the ÖVP leader. An early election will be held on October 15th.
The popularity of the ÖVP new leader, the young minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, propelled his party into first place in the polls. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the ÖVP to win the largest vote share. The most likely coalition to emerge is one that is led by the ÖVP and includes the FPÖ, although negotiations to form one could be fraught.
The inclusion of the FPÖ in the government would not lead to similar EU sanctions as in 2000, when the party was last part of a coalition, owing largely to the normalisation of the far right in Europe since then.
We expect any new government to focus on integration and immigration policy, and to attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and introduce some additional flexibility in labour and product markets. However, low government cohesion is likely to lead to limited progress.
The government budget is forecast to remain in deficit, albeit well within the EU-mandated limit of 3% of GDP, throughout the forecast period (2017-21), as the fiscal consolidation process is likely to be restrained by limited government cohesion and effectiveness. The public debt/GDP ratio will fall gradually.
After several years of underperformance compared with its regional peers, the economy has performed relatively strongly since the start of 2016, growing by 1.6% in 2016. We forecast an acceleration of growth this year, to an upwardly revised 2.5%, and that growth will moderate to 1.6% on average in 2018-21.
Consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) will continue to exceed the euro zone average in 2017-21, driven by structural domestic factors including higher unit wage costs and more regulated markets. Annual inflation averaged 1% in 2016, up from 0.8% in 2015, and we forecast an annual average of 2% in 2017-21.
In 2016 the current-account surplus decreased slightly, to 1.7% of GDP. We forecast that it will average about 2.5% in the coming years as a weakening trade balance is offset by strong tourism receipts.

Austria's business environment score improves slightly between the historical period (2012-16) and the forecast period (2017-21). As a result, the country remains in 12th place in the regional ranking but loses two places in the global ranking, dropping to 21st. Austria's strengths as a business location include decent infrastructure, stable institutions and co-operative labour relations, but high taxes, limited market opportunities and restrictive regulations will persist.
Country forecast overview: Austria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Government works on reducing red tape, but progress likely to be limited.
2019-21: Modest strengthening of competition authority's powers. Administrative reform reduces red tape. More transparency in antitrust proceedings. Risk of political interference in private firms in which state owns substantial stakes.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Foreign investment is generally welcome, but underlying opposition to takeovers of "national champions" persists.
2019-21: Possible erosion of barriers against foreign takeovers as a result of commercial pressure and EU legislation.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: No exchange controls. Foreign trade, governed by EU rules, should remain liberal.
2019-21: EU likely to accelerate shift towards bilateral free-trade agreements as multilateral trade negotiations stagnate. Little progress on EU-US trade deal. Free-trade agreement between the EU and the UK.
Taxes
2017-18: No significant changes to tax system, owing in part to likely deterioration in government effectiveness.
2019-21: Some tax reform is likely assuming a government including the Freedom Party (FPÖ) takes power in 2017. Vested interests will continue to hamper large-scale reform, and the high tax burden will remain.
Financing
2017-18: Financial stability to improve amid tighter regulatory requirements and a reduction in risk from exposure to central and eastern Europe. Credit conditions ease gradually as banks' profitability recovers.
2019-21: Introduction of systemic risk buffer of banks' risk-weighted assets. Further uptake in corporate bond issuance.
The labour market
2017-18: Economy-wide minimum wage introduced. More stringent requirements for early retirement and invalidity pensions. Labour market slowly improves as increase in labour supply moderates and unemployment starts to drop.
2019-21: Continued expansion of labour supply, primarily via net immigration, but concerns about shortage of skilled employees in certain sectors are likely to persist. Early retirement phased out.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Further take-up of broadband services. Gradual improvement of transport links with eastern Europe.
2019-21: Improved transport network connecting main urban centres and providing better access to the country's interior. Gradual transition to low-carbon economy entails significant changes to electricity transmission infrastructure here.

a Actual.
Background: Austria became an important force in central Europe with the formation of the Habsburg empire in the 15th century and remained so until the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the first world war. The Republic of Austria emerged in 1918. In 1938 Austria was incorporated into the German Third Reich. With the departure of the victorious Allied forces in 1955, it regained independence as a neutral country. In the post-war period Austria took great strides to catch up economically with the rest of the developed world and is now one of the most advanced nations. It is a member of the EU and a participant in the economic and monetary union (EMU).
Political structure: Austria is a federal republic and the head of state is the federal president. The government is led by the federal chancellor. The national parliament has two houses: the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house), of 62 members appointed by state parliaments, and the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house), which has 183 members elected by proportional representation. An early general election will be held on October 15th 2017.
Policy issues: The government's stated priorities are to reduce the budget deficit and debt pile, improve labour market participation rates, strengthen competitiveness, increase expenditure on research and development, continue to reform healthcare expenditure, stabilise the financial sector and raise educational standards. Progress on these issues will be modest at best, as tensions surrounding immigration, security and border controls will remain elevated across Europe, diverting attention to security and migration-related policy areas.
Taxation: According to the European Commission, Austrian labour tax as a percentage of GDP is the second highest in the EU. A 2016 tax reform lowered the tax burden for low- and middle-income earners, but raised the top personal income tax rate from 50% to 55%. Social security contributions, shared between employers and employees, are high. Corporation tax is levied at a rate of 25%. Dividend and investment income is subject to a withholding tax of 27.5%. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a standard rate of 20%, and a reduced rate of 13% (raised from 10% in 2016) applies for certain goods and services.
Foreign trade: In 2016 the value of exported goods was US$142.8bn and the goods import bill was US$143bn. The services surplus, traditionally boosted by tourism receipts, was US$11.3bn. Along with a modest primary income deficit and significant secondary income deficit, this yielded a current-account surplus equivalent to 1.7% of GDP.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
Following several years of little progress on reforms, and coalition and party in-fighting, the grand coalition of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) fell apart in May 2017 following the resignation of Reinhold Mitterlehner from the positions of vice-chancellor, minister of economy and leader of the ÖVP, citing frustration within his own party. The popular 31-year-old minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, has taken over the leadership of the ÖVP and will run as the party's lead candidate in the early general election on October 15th. However, probably owing to the party's poor performance in the polls (it has languished in third place since the first half of 2016), Mr Kurz decided to leverage his own popularity by demanding full control over the ÖVP and that the party appear on the ballot as "List Sebastian Kurz-the New People's Party", which would also include a number of people not previously associated with the ÖVP. Following Mr Kurz's arrival as party leader, the ÖVP shot to the top of the polls, pushing the opposition far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) to third place, from first. The campaign still holds the potential to derail Mr Kurz's efforts, as he is inexperienced, especially on topics relating to economic policy, an area in which his main challenger, the current SPÖ chancellor, Christian Kern, is significantly stronger. However, owing in part to the ÖVP's lead (it is polling around 33%, compared with 25% for the second-placed SPÖ), The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the ÖVP to emerge as the largest party in the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house of parliament).
Nevertheless, the election will be a further step in the fraying of the decades-long dominance of the political scene by the SPÖ and the ÖVP, as the ÖVP will have been replaced to a large extent by Mr Kurz's new movement. The two parties have together ruled the country almost continuously since 1945, and a renewed grand coalition has become almost impossible following the break-down of relations between the two parties and the gridlock in recent years. The FPÖ has profited both from this and from concerns about immigration, although Mr Kurz looks to be mostly drawing voters away from the FPÖ, in large part based on his strong stance on immigration and border control.
The most likely coalition to emerge after the election is one led by the ÖVP, with the FPÖ as a junior coalition partner, as the other parties-including the Greens; NEOS, a liberal party; and List Pilz, a new group recently set up by Peter Pilz, a former Green member of parliament (MP)-are unlikely to be large enough to help either the SPÖ or the ÖVP to reach a parliamentary majority. Risks to this outlook are high, as the election could turn, and coalition negotiations could falter because the FPÖ will probably demand significant concessions from Mr Kurz. Regardless of which coalition emerges, we expect political stability to deteriorate further. The government will struggle to implement its policies, as the coalition partners are likely to disagree on economic matters and the FPÖ is likely to struggle to translate its opposition on matters such as immigration and integration into concrete policy proposals. As a result, we expect little progress on significant structural reforms, and the risk of an early election in the next parliamentary term is high.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
The next general election is scheduled for October 15th 2017. The most likely scenario is that the rebranded ÖVP under Mr Kurz will win the largest share of the vote-but not an outright majority-and subsequently form a coalition with the FPÖ.
Elections for several state parliaments are planned for the first half of 2018. The next election for the primarily ceremonial post of federal president will be in 2022.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Austria was severely affected by the European migrant crisis, and this has been the dominant issue in its domestic politics and international relations since 2015. The country has been at the centre of many of the intra-EU spats regarding the bloc's response to the large influx of migrants, owing in part to its unilateral actions. Domestic pressure on the government to be seen as acting against this influx, and thus often against other EU member states, will remain high owing to the strong position of the FPÖ. All three of the large parties have hinted that they want to limit labour migration within the EU, or at least give preferential treatment to Austrian citizens in the labour market, which will exacerbate tensions with many EU member states.
We expect a new government to continue along the same line. Although the previous inclusion of the FPÖ in government following the election in 1999 led to sanctions being imposed by other EU nations in 2000, we do not expect this to be repeated should the party join the next governing coalition. At that time a far-right nationalist party entering government was an unusual development, but since then sister parties to the FPÖ have either entered government or supported minority governments in parliament in several EU countries, including some Nordic countries, Italy and the Netherlands.
The rerun of the presidential election in December 2016 demonstrated the relatively broad support for EU membership. Many voters cited as one of their main reasons for voting for Alexander Van der Bellen-the independent candidate running against Norbert Hofer, the FPÖ candidate-suggestions by Mr Hofer of a possible membership referendum in Austria if the EU did not reform or if Turkey joined the bloc. This experience should moderate any further attempts by the FPÖ to use the EU as a divisive issue.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
Alongside the 2016 tax reform, which provided about EUR5bn in tax relief to households, government policy has focused on challenges facing the country's financial sector. These have included the clean-up and debt restructuring of Heta Asset Resolution, a "bad bank" that was created to deal with the toxic assets of Hypo Group Alpe Adria (HGAA). The uncertainty surrounding Heta was removed in October 2016, when creditors accepted a debt-restructuring deal. The government has also had to manage the banking sector's exposure to central and east European economies.
In the renegotiation of its coalition agreement in January 2017 the coalition decided on a number of measures that it hoped to implement before the end of its term in 2018. These included a new annual minimum wage of EUR21,000, as opposed to only sector-specific negotiated minimum wages, and reducing red tape for employers, including more flexible rules on working hours. However, although the coalition parties agreed to implement a number of these measures before the election in October, we expect little progress. The next government, which is likely to include the FPÖ, will move integration and immigration policy further to the right and is likely to focus on improving the business environment, including by reducing the sizeable tax wedge, but we expect it to struggle to implement significant structural reforms rapidly.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
In 2014 Austria's fiscal accounts deteriorated, mainly reflecting the govern-ment's decision to create a bad bank to deal with HGAA's toxic assets. The fiscal deficit widened to the equivalent of 2.7% of GDP, from 1.4% in 2013, and public debt rose to 84.4% of GDP. Mainly in response to steady direct revenue growth, the deficit narrowed to 1.1% of GDP in 2015, but widened again in 2016, to 1.6%, owing in part to fiscally expansionary tax reforms and higher migrant-related public spending.
We expect the budget to remain in deficit throughout the forecast period (2017-21), albeit safely within the EU mandated limit of 3% of GDP. Despite only limited fiscal consolidation, robust economic growth will help to narrow the deficit slightly. The public debt stock as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline gradually, from 84.6% in 2016 following a positive contribution from the Heta deal, to just below 75% in 2021. In the context of the quantitative easing (QE) undertaken by the European Central Bank (ECB) and Austria's relatively strong fundamentals, funding risks are extremely low in our view.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
The ECB is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero; a series of so-called targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) aimed at pushing banks to lend more money; and a EUR60bn per month quantitative easing (QE) programme, which will run until the end of 2017. However, the economic recovery in the euro zone has maintained momentum-supported by an acceleration in credit growth-and looks to be more broad based. We expect another healthy expansion of real GDP in the euro zone in 2017, of 2%, after growth of 1.9% on average in 2015-16. Although commentary from the ECB's president, Mario Draghi, was cautious in tone following the policy meeting in July, Mr Draghi revealed that the bank's policy-setting governing council would be discussing the future of the QE programme in the autumn of this year. We maintain our view that the bank will begin to wind down gradually, or "taper", the programme in 2018. Nevertheless, underlying price pressure remains relatively subdued, and downside risks to wage growth and the global economy during that year could yet slow the pace at which the ECB will reduce its monthly asset purchases. We forecast that the ECB will not raise policy rates before the end of our forecast period, in 2021.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Austria's initial recovery from the global financial crisis was respectable in the euro zone context, but subsequently the economy largely stalled and under-performed in comparison with regional peers, notably Germany; this was particularly striking given the traditionally high level of synchronisation between the two countries' business cycles. A faltered reform process has contributed to higher inflation compared with regional peers and weakened productivity growth, admittedly from fairly high levels. Real GDP rose by a sluggish 0.8% in 2015, and although it accelerated in 2016, to 1.6%, it remained below Germany's 1.8% growth.
However, the economy has recently started to gain momentum again, with average quarterly growth of 0.7% between July 2016 and June 2017. Although the labour market had in previous years struggled to integrate the significant increase in the labour force, it seemed to have turned a corner in late 2016 and early 2017, when the unemployment rate started to fall. This is supporting private consumption, which we expect to grow by 1.9% this year. Furthermore, export and investment growth have also picked up. As a result, we expect real GDP growth to accelerate to an upwardly revised 2.5% this year, slightly above growth in Germany for the first time since 2005.
We expect the current phase of catch-up growth-following an under-performance even compared with fundamentals in recent years-to continue next year, when we forecast that the economy will expand by 2%. A worsening global economic environment in 2018-20, when we expect a policy-driven slowdown in China and a cyclical slowdown in the US, will weigh on growth in the second half of our forecast period, as will the continued lack of reform progress. Domestic demand will be the main driver of growth, which is likely to converge towards potential growth in these years. We therefore expect average real GDP growth of just 1.5% in 2019-21.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
Annual consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) has been subdued in recent years, but higher than in most other euro zone countries. Inflation averaged 0.8% in 2015 and 1% in 2016-well above average inflation in Germany and the euro zone. This largely reflects structural domestic factors, such as higher unit wage costs, more regulated markets and a period of faster increases in taxes and duties. Rising services prices, energy price base effects and the lagged feedthrough of euro weakness via import costs fostered a gradual rise in inflation from October 2016, and will continue to do so in the rest of 2017, when we forecast full-year average inflation of 2%. We expect inflation to stay above the euro zone average in 2018-21, at 2% on average, as similar structural factors as in previous years persist.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
The euro has moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1 since mid-2015. The annual average exchange rate was US$1.11:EUR1 in 2016, although a sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following the presidential election in the US led to a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1. The euro has since rallied as the region's economic recovery has continued, and as political risk has waned in Europe but risen in the US. More recently, a rise in expectations of QE tapering by the ECB has prompted a sharp appreciation in the euro against the dollar. The value of the euro could yet come under pressure from political risk-especially in relation to the next general election in Italy, which we expect to take place in early 2018-and monetary tightening in the US. Nevertheless, we expect a gradual appreciation on average, to US$1.20:EUR1 by 2020, as the euro is supported by an ongoing recovery in the region and receives structural support from a large current-account surplus. A business cycle downturn in the US will weigh on the value of the dollar in 2020.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
Low oil prices and subdued domestic demand compressing import values helped the trade balance to move into surplus in 2014-15, from a deficit in 2009-13. The recent recovery has pushed up imports and moved the trade balance back into a small deficit in 2016. We expect the trade balance to fluctuate around the even point in the coming years as robust export growth is balanced out by an increase in import prices. However, this will be compensated for by a healthy surplus on the services balance, driven in large part by robust tourism inflows. We therefore expect continued current-account surpluses in our forecast period, of about 2.5% of GDP on average.

Abstract: [...]the ANC's large parliamentary majority, coupled with opposition weaknesses, means that many important debates are hidden from public view within the party hierarchy. [...]The Economist Intelligence Unit projects that the population will rise from an estimated 56m in 2016 to 58.7m in 2021, although the final outcome also depends on levels of net migration. [...]the number of people receiving ARV therapy soared from just 100,000 in 2005 to about 3.5m in 2016, which is enabling many victims to live longer and more productive lives. Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. [...]in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2017-21, not to the likely situation in 2021 only.

Full text: South Africa--highlights: Political outlook
The African National Congress (ANC) will remain the dominant political force and is likely to retain power at the next election in 2019, albeit with a smaller majority than in 2014 (when it won 62.2% of the vote). The president, Jacob Zuma, remains under pressure because of a series of corruption scandals and the ANC's relatively poor showing in municipal elections in 2016, when its voting share fell to a record low of 54%. The ANC is deeply divided into pro-Zuma and anti-Zuma factions, which are evenly matched, helping to explain the president's survival. The ANC's five-yearly electoral summit in December, when Mr Zuma will stand down as party leader (although not as national president), will have a decisive influence on the political scene.

South Africa's population growth rate will remain muted in 2017-21, averaging just 0.9% a year, owing to the adverse impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The number of new infections and the annual death toll from AIDS are both on downward trends, and life expectancy is rising, helped by the expansion of treatment programmes, but the damage will persist into the medium term. The labour force will grow at a faster rate than the overall population, highlighting the urgency of job creation. Rapid urbanisation will present planning challenges and business opportunities.

South Africa's business environment ranking is unchanged at 52nd in 2017-21, as improvements in some areas are offset by declines in others. Supporting factors include a sound banking system, disciplined monetary policy, a steady improvement in infrastructure and a gradual expansion of the black middle class. There are several deterrents, however, such as skills shortages, frequent strikes, strict labour laws and the burden of complying with black economic empowerment (BEE) regulations. Policy uncertainty will remain at a high level because of divisions within government over several key proposals such as a new mining charter (which tightens BEE requirements), a draft expropriation law (which could trim compensation) and a foreign direct investment law (which limits recourse to international arbitration). Legal challenges will probably overturn some of the most controversial plans, but uncertainty will persist in the interim.

Exchange rate R:US$ (av) 14.7 13.7 16.1 18.1 19.3 20.5
South Africa's economy, being relatively small and open, will remain vulnerable to global developments and commodity price fluctuations. Growth will rise slightly to 0.8% in 2017-after slipping to just 0.3% in 2016 because of a crippling drought. A rebound in agriculture (and to a lesser extent mining) will be offset by weaknesses in other sectors, stemming from weak aggregate demand. In addition, policy uncertainty will stifle private investment. Growth will show a broad upward trend during 2018-21, but will remain relatively subdued in view of constraints such as high unemployment, skills shortages and frequent strikes. More positively, South Africa will no longer be short of electricity after new plant openings. Inflation breached the central bank's 3-6% target range in 2016, owing to drought, but will stay within the target band in 2017-21, despite possible temporary breaches.

South Africa's market will expand during the forecast period as the black majority is increasingly drawn into the mainstream commercial economy, boosting demand for goods and services across a wide range of sectors. Nonetheless, high unemployment and household indebtedness will constrain the rate of economic growth, despite a recent cut in interest rates. A weak outcome in 2017 will be followed by a gentle rebound in 2018-21, helped by the expansion of the black middle class, higher levels of financial inclusion, the rollout of low-cost housing and improved electricity supplies.

We expect real GDP growth to average 3.1% a year in 2017-30, underpinned by the gradual completion of major infrastructure projects, the rise of the black middle class and regional integration, although slow population growth will act as a constraint. Economic growth will quicken to 3.7% a year in 2031-50, driven by technological advances such as additive printing and cloud computing. Growth in capital stocks will outpace growth in labour productivity throughout the period.

Background: South Africa became a full democracy in 1994, when it held its first all-race elections. The African National Congress (ANC) won, and has dominated all of the subsequent elections-in 1999, 2004, 2009 and, most recently, in May 2014. However, support ebbed from a peak of nearly 70% in 2004, to 62.2% in 2014 and a worst-ever 53.9% in municipal elections in August 2016. Jacob Zuma assumed the presidency in 2009 and is serving a second (and final) five-year term ending in 2019.
Political structure: South Africa is a constitutional democracy with a bicameral parliament and an executive president elected by parliament. The constitution is the supreme law of the land. The 400-member National Assembly is elected by proportional representation; the National Council of the Provinces consists of indirectly elected representatives of the nine provinces. The judiciary is fully independent and includes an 11-member Constitutional Court. The constitution provides for an independent corruption watchdog, the Public Protector, and for independent commissions on human rights, gender equality and the restitution of land rights.
Policy issues: Boosting growth, creating jobs, advancing black economic empowerment and reducing inequality-while maintaining fiscal and monetary discipline-are the main aims of government economic policy. Divisions within the ruling party, highlighted by a controversial cabinet reshuffle and the consequent loss of South Africa's investment-grade credit rating, mark a rise in policy uncertainty. The labour market will remain rigid and marked by frequent strikes, exacerbated by the political power of the trade unions. Skills shortages will persist, reflecting weaknesses in education. The environment for private enterprise will remain broadly accommodating, and opportunities for public-private partnerships will arise, although a new foreign direct investment law, when implemented, may limit recourse to international arbitration. Speeding up land reform without damaging farm production or alienating investors will remain a key challenge.
Taxation: Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a flat rate of 14% with no exceptions. The corporation tax rate, at 28%, is likely to remain unchanged, but personal income taxes are moving higher because of revenue shortfalls. Planned special economic zones will, nonetheless, offer tax concessions.
Foreign trade: South Africa has a relatively open economy, with foreign trade (imports plus exports) accounting for around 52% of GDP in 2015. China, the EU, the US and Japan are among its largest trading partners. Trade with the rest of Africa has become progressively more important, and it is the only region with which South Africa has a trade surplus.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
Present government: The African National Congress (ANC) has dominated South African politics since the 1994 election brought an end to apartheid and white minority rule. The party won another comfortable victory in May 2014, albeit with a reduced share of the vote. The ANC, led by Nelson Mandela (1991-97), Thabo Mbeki (1997-2007) and now Jacob Zuma, steadily raised its voting share to a high-water mark of 69.7% in 2004, although support ebbed to 65.9% in 2009 and 62.2% in 2014 (and fell to an all-time low of 54% in municipal elections in 2016). The ANC continues to hold a large majority of seats in parliament under South Africa's proportional representation system of voting. The party also retained eight of the nine provinces in 2014. The ANC rules in partnership with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South African Communist Party (SACP) in a tripartite alliance.
Opposition: The Democratic Alliance (DA), which draws most of its support from minority voters (white, mixed-race and Indian), increased its share of the vote from 16.7% in 2009 to 22.2% in 2014 and remains the official opposition. The election of Mmusi Maimane as the DA's new leader in 2015 marked a watershed moment in South African politics. As the party's first black leader, Mr Maimane could help to spread the DA's appeal to the majority black electorate, especially in urban areas. Illustrating this, the DA secured 26.9% of votes in 2016's municipal elections. The Economic Freedom Fighters, a new party led by Julius Malema, who espouses a radical agenda, came third with 6.3% of the vote in 2014. Other opposition groups include the Inkatha Freedom Party and the breakaway New Freedom Party, which are both based in KwaZulu-Natal. Support for the Congress of the People (Cope), which broke away from the ANC to win 7.4% of the vote in 2009, collapsed to less than 1% in 2014 following protracted leadership disputes.

Political outlook: Political stability
The ruling African National Congress (ANC) will remain in power until the 2019 general election, although its chances of winning another (sixth) term have receded. This reflects the party's worst-ever showing in last August's municipal elections and increasingly bitter internal divisions between supporters and opponents of the president, Jacob Zuma. The anti-Zuma faction fears that the president's string of corruption scandals will cause long-lasting electoral damage, whereas pro-Zuma loyalists are keen to protect existing patronage networks. A reshuffle by the president on March 31st-when he sacked the respected finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, and several other ministers-and a recent leak of a large cache of emails that appear to provide further evidence of the "capture" of state institutions by the Gupta brothers (businessmen close to the president) have exacerbated ANC in-fighting. The decision by two credit rating agencies to cut South Africa's sovereign credit rating from investment-grade to junk has added further tension, amid concerns that Mr Zuma's "capture" of the Treasury will amplify corruption.
Several high-profile ANC figures, and the party's allies-the South African Communist Party and the Congress of South African Trade Unions-are openly calling for Mr Zuma's resignation, but eight years in power have allowed him to build a strong support base. Both the anti-Zuma and pro-Zuma camps are evenly matched, including on the party's National Executive Committee, making it difficult to force the president's removal. Mr Zuma survived a no-confidence motion in parliament on August 8th, despite the speaker, Baleka Mbete, in a surprise decision, allowing a secret ballot. However, the president's 198-177 margin of victory suggests that at least 26 ANC legislators voted against him (while others abstained), which further weakens his position. Many of their colleagues similarly oppose the president but were reluctant to depose him (and his government), as this would have been an unprecedented act by parliament.
Barring Mr Zuma's early departure, the future of the ANC (and the wider political scene) will rest on the outcome of the party's five-yearly electoral summit in December. Mr Zuma will stand down as party leader (although not as national president) but is seeking to engineer the succession in favour of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma (the former chair of the Africa Union Commission and his ex-wife) to maximise his influence during the remainder of his presidency. The anti-Zuma camp, comprising large sections of the urban population, trade unions and centrists, instead back Cyril Ramaphosa (the deputy leader of both party and country), who would probably pursue a more pragmatic agenda. Internal campaigning will intensify ahead of December as each side attempts to gain an advantage, although a deadlock could see a third, compromise candidate emerge. A failure by Mr Zuma to secure his preferred leadership team would increase the chances of his early departure from the presidency.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
The constitution, painstakingly negotiated in the run-up to the 1994 election, is the bedrock of South Africa's non-racial, post-apartheid society, and is respected across most of the political spectrum. The constitution embodies a fairly robust separation of powers between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary, and provides for strong institutions such as a Constitutional Court and an inde-pendent central bank. These basic cornerstones of South African democracy are unlikely to face any serious threats over the outlook period. Constitutional amendments, of which there have been 17 to date, require the support of at least two-thirds of members of parliament (MPs)-rising to three-quarters for key provisions-but changes thus far (such as allowing floor-crossing by MPs and then subsequently rescinding the measure) have not significantly altered the balance of power. The ANC may seek to trim provincial authority during the forecast period, in favour of central government, but would face fierce resistance. The most recent amendment, which was implemented in 2013, extends the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court. However, plans to lengthen the terms of the Court's judges, from 12 years to life, were dropped, reducing the risk of political appointees becoming embedded. The government has criticised some court rulings against controversial appointments and policies-leading the chief justice, Mogoeng Mogoeng, to rebuke the executive for interfering-but, despite the tension, The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that judicial independence will not be compromised.
However, there are several weaknesses in the current political system that work against effective government. First, the electoral code, based on pure proportional representation and a party list system, means that there is no direct link between MPs and their constituents, which gives Luthuli House (the ANC headquarters) and the executive much greater influence over legislators than would otherwise be the case. Linked to this, appointments to some key institutions (such as the National Prosecuting Authority) are often made for political reasons, which compromises their effectiveness. Second, the ANC's large parliamentary majority, coupled with opposition weaknesses, means that many important debates are hidden from public view within the party hierarchy. Other factors working against good governance are an increase in patronage and corruption under the president, Mr Zuma, and serious internal divisions between his supporters and opponents. The municipal election results in August 2016, when the ANC's voting share dipped to a record low of 54%-thereby allowing the opposition to capture three key municipalities-potentially herald an end to ANC hegemony. This would be positive for democratic deepening, but the speed of the process and the resulting outcome remain uncertain.
Political outlook: Election watch
The ANC's voting share shrank to 54% in last August's municipal elections, putting its majority at risk in 2019, although it typically does better in national polls, helped by higher turnouts. The ANC will hope that a new party leadership will revive its fortunes, especially given Mr Zuma's loss of popularity. However, leadership change alone may be insufficient to revitalise the ANC without renewed efforts to crack down on corruption, improve service delivery and spur job creation via much-needed structural reforms. The 2019 election outcome will also depend on the interim performance of the Democratic Alliance (DA)-and its coalition partners-in newly captured metropolitan councils. The challenges of expansion and running minority administrations will test the DA's reputation for stronger governance. The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that the ANC will retain a small national majority in 2019 (with a similar voting share to 2016), although the opposition is well placed to capture Gauteng, to add to its control of Western Cape. The period of ANC hegemony is coming to an end, although the speed of the process and the resulting outcome are far from certain.
Political outlook: Key players to watch
Jacob Zuma
The president, re-elected in May 2014, is due to stand down as leader of the African National Congress (ANC) in December 2017 and as president in 2019, after two five-year terms in each case. However, a series of corruption scandals, coupled with a sharp fall in the ANC's voting share in municipal elections in August 2016, have weakened his authority. A failure by Mr Zuma to engineer a victory for his preferred leadership team at the ANC's electoral summit in December could bring a premature end to his presidency.
Cyril Ramaphosa
The influential former politician-turned-businessman, and the deputy leader of the ANC (since 2012) and the country (since 2014), Mr Ramaphosa is one of the two frontrunners to become the new ANC boss in December. As a moderate and a pragmatist, with trade union roots, he draws support from both the ANC's centre and left, but faces opposition from the pro-Zuma camp. Mr Ramaphosa's lengthy period in business (when he became very wealthy) arouses some distrust.
Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma
The former chair of the African Union Commission and Mr Zuma's ex-wife, Ms Dlamini-Zuma is the other main contender to become the next ANC leader. As Mr Zuma's preferred successor, she is backed by the president's allies, but she could also be tarnished by the president's loss of credibility. Based on her extensive ministerial career (prior to joining the African Union), Ms Dlamini-Zuma would not be an inspired or reformist leader.
Gwede Mantashe
Now serving a second term as ANC secretary-general, Mr Mantashe is also chairman of the South African Communist Party, thus adding substance (and tension) to the tripartite alliance. As a powerful official and an effective administrator, he will play a kingmaker role when the ANC selects a new leader. Despite his implicit opposition to Mr Zuma, he will, nonetheless, continue to mediate between all wings of the tripartite alliance.
Baleka Mbete
The speaker of the National Assembly and chair of the ANC, Mr Mbete is one of several candidates that could emerge as the new ANC leader in December in the event of a deadlock between the two main contenders. Her surprise decision to allow for a secret ballot in a recent no-confidence motion against Mr Zuma boosted her profile. Zweli Mkhize, the ANC treasurer, is another potential compromise candidate, given his good working relationship with all the main factions.
Malusi Gigaba
Installed as finance minister in March 2017, after the president controversially sacked Pravin Gordhan, who was widely respected, Mr Gigaba is viewed as being loyal to Mr Zuma, but he is also relatively young and ambitious, from the next generation of politicians. He is potentially well placed to rise up the party hierarchy, provided his stint at the Treasury is not deemed to be a failure.
Julius Malema
Expelled from the ANC in 2012 for repeated defiance, Mr Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) secured third place in the 2014 election with 6.3% of the vote. The EFF regularly disrupts parliament, leading to its expulsion on several occasions, and will continue to espouse radical and populist policies, such as nationalisation and expropriation. The party won 8.2% of the vote in municipal elections in August 2016, giving it the balance of power in several municipalities.
Mmusi Maimane
Elected as the new leader of the Democratic Alliance (DA, the official opposition) in May 2015, the youthful Mr Maimane (aged 35) has enjoyed a swift rise up the party hierarchy since entering politics in 2010 and becoming the DA's parliamentary leader in 2014. His is helping to spread the party's appeal beyond minority groups to the black majority, as shown by the DA's improved performance in municipal elections in August 2016. His predecessor, Helen Zille, will retain the premiership of the Western Cape.
Thuli Madonsela
Named by Time, a US weekly news magazine, in April 2014 as one of the world's 100 most influential people, Ms Madonsela, a lawyer who helped to draft the constitution, became an increasingly effective anti-corruption fighter after she was appointed as public protector in 2009. A string of detailed reports, including into taxpayer-funded improvements to Mr Zuma's Nkandla homestead, bolstered her reputation. Replaced by Busisiwe Mkhwebane when her term ended in October 2016, she could enter the political arena.
Political outlook: International relations
South Africa, the most advanced economy in Africa, will play an important role in regional and world affairs. The country will remain deeply engaged with Africa, particularly Southern Africa, and will continue to support peacekeeping operations in the continent's conflict zones. Alongside fellow members of the Southern African Development Community, South Africa will also seek to build closer "South-South" ties, especially with fellow members of the BRICS grouping (Brazil, Russia, India and China) and with other African trade blocs. South Africa's prioritisation of African ties partly explains the submission in October 2016 of a notice of withdrawal to the International Criminal Court (ICC), which some argue unfairly targets the continent. However, South Africa revoked the withdrawal notice in March after a High Court in Pretoria ruled that the government is constitutionally unable to leave the ICC without first passing an act of parliament. South Africa's future membership of the ICC is therefore subject to a range of uncertainties.

The population will continue to grow relatively slowly
South Africa's population is projected to grow at a relatively modest rate of 0.9% a year in 2017-21, owing to the sustained impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. As a result, The Economist Intelligence Unit projects that the population will rise from an estimated 56m in 2016 to 58.7m in 2021, although the final outcome also depends on levels of net migration. According to the latest official estimates for 2017, 7.1m people were living with HIV/AIDS-the most of any country, and equivalent to 12.6% of the population. However, most AIDS indicators are now improving, helped by treatment programmes and education campaigns. The incidence rate (of new infections) fell to just 0.9% in 2017, for example, from 1.9% in 2005, and the prevalence rate among 15-49 year olds eased to 18%, its lowest level for ten years. Moreover, the number of deaths attributable to AIDS shrank to a multi-year low of 126,755 in 2017 (equivalent to 25% of all deaths) from a peak level of 345,185 in 2006 (49.2% of deaths), because of the rollout of anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy. Thabo Mbeki (the president from 1999-2008) initially dismissed the efficacy of ARV drugs, a stance that significantly worsened the AIDS crisis, but drug treatment gathered pace in 2007 and gained new momentum after Jacob Zuma became president in 2009. As a result, the number of people receiving ARV therapy soared from just 100,000 in 2005 to about 3.5m in 2016, which is enabling many victims to live longer and more productive lives. The costs of treatment are substantial, however, amounting to about US$2bn a year, funded mostly from domestic sources.
A small increase in the incidence rate and in AIDS-related deaths in 2015 raised concerns that progress against the disease had stalled (possibly because of treatment failings) but the figures for 2016 and 2017 reveal the resumption of a downward trend in both indicators. Nonetheless, AIDS will remain a significant source of mortality in South Africa into the medium term, and will continue to impose high costs at the household, corporate and national levels. The loss of trained workers, either through death or extended absenteeism, is particularly damaging in a country so short of skills. This requires organisations to adopt coping strategies, such as increased expenditure on training. A weak public health system, following years of mismanagement and underinvestment, is an additional challenge, leading to increased reliance on private healthcare for those who can afford to pay. The government plans to introduce a national health insurance system during the forecast period, but progress will be slow because of financial and logistical constraints.
Life expectancy will rise steadily
The success of ARV drugs is clear from the steady rise in like expectancy from a low 53.5 years in 2006 to 64 years in 2017, according to the latest official mid-year estimates, although there are divergences between different data sources. The improvement moved South African life expectancy closer to the average for other upper-middle-income countries, and a further increase can be expected during the forecast period. The age profile of the country will remain heavily skewed towards children and young adults: mid-year estimates for 2017 show that 56.4% of the population is aged under 30 years and 29.6% under 15 years. Average life expectancy and age profiles are markedly different according to population group. The black population-80.8% of the total in mid-2017-is more skewed towards the youth segment than the national average, whereas the white population-8% of the total, and typically more highly educated and wealthier-has an age profile more closely aligned with OECD averages. The other main population groups are mixed-race people ("coloureds"), with 8.8% of the total, and Indian/Asian, with 2.5%.
Rapid urbanisation will strain social services
South Africa has experienced urbanisation on a large scale (an estimated 65.3% of the population lived in urban centres in 2016), principally in the main metropolitan areas of Gauteng, namely Pretoria and Johannesburg, and the two coastal cities of Cape Town and Durban. Urbanisation will continue throughout the forecast period, lifting the proportion living in cities (and associated slums) to 68.5% by 2021. Urbanisation is boosting market potential but also raises challenges for policymakers, especially with regard to strengthening service delivery at the municipal level, where capacity is typically weaker. Urbanisation is being accompanied by the rapid growth of informal settlements in the vicinity of cities and towns across the country, fuelled by population movements from poorer provinces (such as Limpopo and North West) to richer ones, and migration from neighbouring countries. Poor service provision, high unemployment and inward migration will also fuel protests, some of which will be violent and tinged with xenophobia.

Investment in critical infrastructure will facilitate business operations
South Africa's business environment rankings for 2017-21 remain unchanged at 52nd globally and seventh regionally, despite a small rise in the country's absolute score. As a key emerging market (and the most advanced economy in Africa), with vast mineral reserves, sound banks and a broad commitment to free markets, the country will remain an important business centre. Ongoing investment in critical infrastructure will facilitate business operations, and progress against HIV/AIDS is boosting life expectancy.
Companies will, however, face a significant number of challenges, ranging from slow GDP growth and high unemployment to elevated policy uncertainty. The fate of key legislation, such as a draft expropriation bill (which may reduce compensation), a foreign investment act (that limits recourse to international arbitration) and a new mining charter (which imposes stricter rules governing black economic empowerment; BEE), is currently unclear. Fudged and inconsistent policymaking (and implementation) reflects deep divisions within the ruling African National Congress (ANC) between supporters and opponents of the president, Jacob Zuma, who stands accused of corruption and patronage. The former main divide, between free-market moderates and left-wing interventionists, is now less significant (at least temporarily) as both stand in the anti-Zuma camp. A well-crafted National Development Plan outlines a framework for faster growth, but implementation is being impeded by government divisions. Other challenges include strict labour laws and frequent strikes (both of which reflect the political power of the trade unions), skills shortages, high crime rates and deep-seated inequality. More positively, South Africa has several robust institutions, such as an independent central bank (the South African Reserve Bank; SARB) and an impartial judiciary, which is increasingly being relied on to challenge controversial legislation. In addition, electricity shortages have now ended, helped by new plant openings, although rising real-term tariffs will offset some of the benefits.
Business environment outlook: South Africa's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Policy is broadly pro-business, but favourable moves, such as new special economic zones offering tax incentives, are accompanied by tighter competition laws and stricter black economic empowerment (BEE) rules.
2019-21: Efforts to speed up land reform intensify, although the government rejects expropriation without compensation. Investment incentives in selected industries (such as automotive manufacturing) remain in place.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: A new foreign investment law risks limiting access to international arbitration, and a new mining charter is likely to impose new regulations. A draft expropriation law, which could affect levels of compensation, re-emerges from parliament.
2019-21: The government continues to encourage foreign investment and public-private partnerships but remains opposed to the privatisation of state assets in most cases.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Some remaining exchange controls on capital flows are relaxed but others are retained. Selected trade tariffs are raised to protect vulnerable industries (such as steel). Efforts to build closer trade ties with key emerging markets continue.
2019-21: Progress towards regional economic integration in Southern Africa makes some advances, but barriers persist.
Taxes
2017-18: Tough fiscal conditions lead to higher direct and indirect taxes, although corporation tax rates remain unchanged. A carbon tax is introduced, but many details are still pending.
2019-21: Efforts continue to streamline and modernise the tax system, and expand the tax base.
Financing
2017-18: A rise in borrowing costs across the economy accompanies the loss of South Africa's investment-grade credit rating. Local banks remain sound and profitable on aggregate, and continue to be a key source of corporate financing.
2019-21: The central bank's continued independence helps to preserve financial system stability. Interest rates stabilise before edging lower, leading to cheaper borrowing.
The labour market
2017-18: Labour laws stay inflexible, despite the negative impact on employment, because of trade unions' political power. Rising wages (including a proposed national minimum wage) and the risk of strikes deter business from creating jobs.
2019-21: The labour market remains tough, owing to skills shortages and BEE targets.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Investment in transport and electricity boosts capacity, although bottlenecks persist. The rollout of domestic fibre-optic cables boosts telecommunications provision and cuts costs.
2019-21: The phased start-up of new base-load electricity-generating plants facilitates fresh investment in energy-intensive sectors, but rising power tariffs remain a deterrent.

The macroeconomic environment score stagnates in absolute terms for the forecast period, pushing down South Africa's global ranking to 70th (from 68th) and its regional ranking to tenth (from ninth). Real GDP growth will remain sluggish (averaging just 1.8% a year in 2017-21) but will show a broad upward trend, from 0.8% in 2017 to 2.5% in 2021, driven by modest rises in consumption and investment, and improved electricity supplies. Nonetheless, growth will remain vulnerable to global developments (such as the UK's exit from the EU and a slowdown in China) and to domestic policy uncertainty, and will be insufficient to bring down the high unemployment rate (currently 27.7%). A small interest-rate cut in July may give a small boost to growth, but recent downgrades to South Africa's credit rating by key agencies will dampen confidence. The current-account deficit will remain a source of vulnerability, although it will move within a fairly narrow range of 3.8-4.6% of GDP in 2017-21. The rand-a widely traded and market-determined currency-will resume depreciating in 2018-21 after a rare year of strengthening in 2017, although the pace of decline will taper off towards the end of the forecast period. Inflation breached the SARB's 3-6% target range by a small margin in 2016 (as drought drove food prices higher) but The Economist Intelligence Unit expects inflation to fall back within the target range in 2017-21 (except for temporary breaches), underpinned by prudent monetary policy and weak growth in demand.
The challenge of black economic empowerment
A unique, challenging and controversial aspect of South Africa's policy environment is the black economic empowerment (BEE) programme, which aims to redress the iniquities of the apartheid era-whereby most wealth and assets ended up in the hands of the white minority-by gradually transferring economic power to the black majority. Legislation governing BEE includes sector-specific charters and broader-based codes of good conduct, both of which set targets for ownership and other variables. Broadly speaking, BEE requires firms to have 25% black ownership, although the precise figure varies by sector (and foreign subsidiaries are largely exempt from equity transfer rules). Revised BEE codes of practice, which came into force in May 2015, cut the number of elements on a company's BEE scorecard from seven to five-ownership, enterprise and supplier development, skills development, management control and socioeconomic development-and reweighted the various components. Alongside other changes, this will make it harder for firms to earn (or retain) a BEE-compliant rating: non-compliant firms will be at a competitive disadvantage when bidding for government contracts or negotiating public-private partnerships. Apart from the problems posed by changes to the rules, two key questions remain unanswered after 15 years of BEE: how long will BEE remain in force, and is a once-empowered company always empowered? A new draft mining charter, unveiled in June 2017, dismisses the "once empowered, always empowered" principle, by requiring mining companies to set up new BEE deals to replace any that have lapsed (such as when black shareholders sell their stakes). A court ruling on the principle, which will have implications for other sectors, is expected in November. With regard to wealth transfer, BEE has been partly successful: the initial benefits were spread fairly narrowly (helping to create a new black elite), although a drive towards more broad-based empowerment (by including workers and suppliers, for example), may distribute the rewards more evenly.

Policy towards private enterprise will remain broadly accommodating, but problems in some areas will lead to a small deterioration in South Africa's global and regional rankings. Monetary policy will remain prudent, and public-private partnerships (PPPs) will become more commonplace (especially for capital projects), but levels of uncertainty are rising, especially since the president, Mr Zuma, carried out a shock cabinet reshuffle in March, including the sacking of his respected finance minister, and his replacement by a loyalist. This poses a threat to fiscal discipline, although the risks may not materialise. Under the guise of "radical economic transformation", Mr Zuma and his allies also back other controversial actions, such as expropriation without compen-sation, and increasing BEE ownership targets for mines. However, as shown by a key ANC policy conference in June, backing for such measures is lukewarm at best. The risk of radical policies being implemented is therefore small, but the level of uncertainty is high, especially in the run-up to the ANC's electoral summit in December. Coupled with concerns about higher taxes and labour militancy, investment is likely to be muted until the uncertainties are clarified. Business lobbying against controversial proposals can sometimes be effective.
Powerful parastatals (such as the power generator, Eskom, and the port/rail operator, Transnet) will continue to play a key role, despite suffering from weak management, political interference and financial indiscipline. This will limit private opportunity, although there will be some openings for PPPs and independent initiatives, especially in the energy sector. The ANC will not embrace nationalisation but will remain wary of outright privatisation, and proposals to inject private capital into ailing parastatals will face delays. The government's industrial policy will continue to offer incentives in some sectors, especially vehicles and textiles, and planned new special economic zones will provide tax concessions. The latest industrial policy iteration in May heralds support for steel, agro-processing and a new black industrialists programme.
Land reform will remain very challenging
Property and shareholder rights are respected and asset transfer currently takes place on a "willing buyer, willing seller" basis. A new draft expropriation bill (currently in abeyance), though compliant with the constitution, would, nonetheless, de-link compensation from market rates-by allowing the figure to be determined by a valuer-general in cases of dispute-although the courts would remain the ultimate arbiter. The draft expropriation bill is partly geared towards expediting the process of land reform, which is running well behind target. The government originally hoped to transfer 30% of white farmland to blacks by 2014, but the current level is about 10% because of a lack of funds, inefficient institutions and poor support for new black farmers. Other land reform proposals, such as setting a maximum cap on farm size and barring foreigners from owning farmland, risk damaging agricultural productivity and wider investor confidence, if not handled carefully.
Competition policy is becoming stricter
Policy towards anti-competitive practices is becoming stricter, as the competition authorities (comprising a commission and a tribunal) intensify their battle against cartels and over-pricing. This trend will continue in 2017-21, guided by the phased implementation of an amended competition law (originally passed in 2009). Changes already implemented include allowing the commission to launch a probe without receiving a formal complaint, while others remain pending, such as making directors criminally liable for misdeeds (which may come into force during the forecast period). However, the stricter line being taken by the competition agencies has the potential to be counterproductive. Securing approval from the competition authorities for mergers can be a lengthy process, especially for large deals involving foreign takeovers; conditions are typically attached, such as retaining jobs or supporting local suppliers.
A new company law provides for an alternative to bankruptcy
A new Company Act, which finally came into force in 2011 after several years of gestation, is broadly positive for business. Key benefits include the introduction of a new business rescue scheme (as an alternative to bankruptcy) and increased shareholder rights (to facilitate corporate governance). The new company law will mostly affect large firms and new enterprises, as most existing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remain regulated by the Closed Corporations Act (of 1984), which is no longer an option for start-ups. The law also created the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission, which is charged with registering new firms and patents, although it will continue to struggle to eliminate the delays and inefficiencies that troubled its predecessor.

Policy uncertainties could hamper FDI inflows
South Africa will remain a key destination for non-oil foreign direct investment (FDI) in Africa during the forecast period, including in banking, telecoms, tourism, mining and manufacturing, helped by the country's role as a gateway to the rest of the continent, especially Southern Africa. This will facilitate a small improvement in South Africa's ranking during the forecast period, despite the uncertainties surrounding several key policies. A controversial new mining charter, for example, unveiled in June, could inhibit investment in minerals, although legal challenges by the Chamber of Mines have a good chance of overturning some of the measures. Foreign investors, for the most part, face the same challenges as domestic firms, including strict labour laws, uncertainties surrounding land rights and the dominant position of parastatals. Opposition by elements in the ANC to foreign influence in strategic sectors, especially towards foreign acquisitions of local firms, can be an additional obstacle. Deals can be subject to close scrutiny, and come with conditions attached, as was the case when a US retail giant, Walmart, acquired a majority stake in Massmart in 2011.
A new Promotion and Protection of Investment Bill, known more simply as the FDI bill, threatens to create a new raft of uncertainties. The bill, which was signed into law by the president in December 2015 but has not yet been implemented, limits recourse to international arbitration, leaving local courts responsible for settling disputes. The government claims that the new law will provide a more streamlined environment for FDI (compared with existing ad hoc arrangements), and that South Africa's constitution (and judiciary) provides sufficient protection. However, investors will remain wary until the full details are clarified. As the new law has yet to come into force, the impact will depend partly on the accompanying regulations. South Africa has also terminated (or failed to extend) around a dozen bilateral investment treaties with EU countries, believing them to have little impact on actual investment flows, which is exacerbating investors' concerns.
FDI will be driven in part by opportunities for PPPs, as well as private-led initiatives, especially in the field of infrastructure provision. For example, private firms, both foreign and local, are playing a leading role in the rollout of renewable energy (especially solar and wind), having invested almost US$14bn to date, with more projects planned, although delays in securing connections to the grid are a source of concern.

Exchange controls will be gradually liberalised
South Africa has progressively loosened exchange controls on capital flows in recent years, by moving from centralised directives towards prudential self-regulation. This trend is likely to continue, although some restrictions will remain in place. Liberalisation stalled during the 2008-09 global financial crisis (as the controls offered some protection, by constraining capital flight), but gained new momentum in 2010-11 when the Treasury embarked on a new wave of reforms. These include removing the ceiling for outward investment; lowering the ceiling on advance payments for imports; allowing South African companies to open foreign bank accounts without prior approval; permitting banks to invest 25% of their liabilities in offshore portfolio instruments; and offering concessions to foreign firms that set up headquarters in South Africa. Numerous restrictions and limits remain in place, however, and regulations are subject to amendment, which requires close monitoring to ensure compliance. Additional reforms remain under consideration, although liberalisation will be a gradual process, especially in view of lingering concerns about the stability of the global financial system.
Sluggish growth combined with an activist industrial policy will lead to protective measures in some cases (in the form of higher tariffs and anti-dumping duties)-such as for steel-although South Africa will seek to remain compliant with World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. Vehicle assembly, in particular, will continue to offer incentives to manufacturers, although these now take the form of production incentives (rather than trade-related incentives) in order to meet WTO requirements.
The Southern African Development Community (SADC) will progressively implement a free-trade area, but the initiative is running behind schedule because of wide economic and policy divergences between member states. Loftier ambitions for a customs union, a common market and monetary union are unlikely to be realised during the outlook period. The proposed merger of SADC, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa) and the East African Community (EAC) into a Tripartite Free-Trade Area will potentially speed up integration by providing a harmonised framework, but a final agreement remains pending. Non-tariff barriers and poor infrastructure links are other serious obstacles. Nonetheless, regional integration will advance in stages, thereby increasing potential market size.
South Africa (and other members of the South Africa Customs Union) successfully negotiated a new economic partnership agreement (EPA) with the EU in 2014. The deal will facilitate deeper trade and investment ties, and provides improved access to the EU for South African agricultural exports. South Africa will also retain trade preferences in the US under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which has been extended by ten years to 2025. South Africa's continued participation was under threat, because of restrictions imposed on US meat imports, but the issue was finally settled in January 2016. Nonetheless, South Africa's AGOA status will remain conditional on its policies towards trade liberalisation and investment protection.

Tight fiscal conditions will increase the risk of tax rises
Tight fiscal conditions, marked by sluggish growth and revenue shortfalls, will heighten the risk of further tax increases during the forecast period. This will lead to a fall in South Africa's global and regional rankings. Taxes remain on an upward trend following hikes in income tax in fiscal years 2015/16 and 2017/18 (April to March)-including a new top rate of 45%-and increases in capital gains taxes in 2016/17. The corporation tax rate (of 28%) is unlikely to be increased, but the government may raise the value-added tax (VAT) rate, currently at 14%, if the pace of fiscal consolidation falls behind schedule or if funds are urgently needed (for instance, to finance the proposed National Health Insurance plan). Other changes to the tax system will be implemented during the forecast period-including administrative reforms-informed by an ongoing review of taxation being undertaken by the Davis Tax Committee, which may not be completed until late 2017. The aim is to streamline the system and boost compliance, while also sealing loopholes and cracking down on evasion.
Tax incentives will continue to apply in some cases, including for small firms, which have enjoyed reduced corporation tax rates since 2013. A youth employment subsidy (via tax concessions) from 2014 remains in place, although its duration is uncertain. The government also proposes to offer a discounted 15% rate of corporation tax in proposed new special economic zones (which will replace the existing industrial development zones that do not offer tax concessions), but final approval remains pending.
New environmental and health-related taxes will be introduced during the forecast period, including a carbon tax (intended to curb emissions and improve energy efficiency) and, possibly, a sugar tax. However, implementation of proposals for a broad-based carbon tax continues to face delays, because of the complexity of the issue and the need to devise a suitable framework that does not unduly disadvantage local industry. Firms will continue to lobby against the measure, although some form of carbon tax will be introduced during the forecast period (possibly in the 2018/19 budget but probably later).

Banks remain sound and well-capitalised
The banking system remains sound and well-capitalised, and is supervised effectively by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB, the central bank), although challenges such as slow GDP growth and regulatory uncertainty explain the decline in the ranking. Banks' capital-adequacy ratios remain comfortably above prescribed minimum levels, and profitability (as measured by return on equity) remains satisfactory, despite a small dip to 16.6% in June from 17% a year earlier. Despite interest-rate rises totalling 200 basis points in 2014-16, the non-performing loan ratio remains low, and was unchanged at 2.9% in June 2017 from a year earlier. Banks are, nonetheless, facing weak overall demand for private-sector credit because of subdued borrowing by households. The growth rate in credit allocation to households fell to just 0.7% year on year in March 2017, before picking up to 2.9% in June, although both figures are negative in real terms. Lending to business is more robust, and grew by 8.8% in March, rising to 9% in June. A small, 25-basis-point interest-rate cut to 6.75% in July 2017 (which lowered the prime lending rate to 10.25%), will facilitate credit growth. Local banks will remain a key source of funds for private investment projects, as illustrated by their participation in the financing of renewable energy projects. Other key sources of financing are the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and, to an increasing extent, local development finance institutions, such as the Industrial Development Corporation.
The four dominant banks-Barclays Africa/ABSA, Nedbank, Standard and First Rand-are world-class players with strong international links. They are also, to varying degrees, expanding their presence in the rest of Africa, thereby cementing South Africa's role as a gateway to the rest of the continent. Smaller banks, especially those specialising in unsecured lending, are more vulnerable: Africa Bank (Abil) collapsed in 2014, although a rescue package by the SARB showed the regulator's willingness to act when financial stability is threatened. The withdrawal by Barclays from Africa, largely completed in June 2017 with the sale of additional shares to local institutional investors, poses no threat to the overall health or performance of the banking sector, but will lead to rebranding.
The policy front poses opportunities and challenges. Positively, initial implementation of the amended Financial Intelligence Centre Act in June, which met a deadline set by the Financial Action Task Force, removes a threat to the credibility of local banks and will help to tackle money-laundering. However, the long-delayed revision of the financial sector charter could see the imposition of tougher BEE rules. The phased implementation of more stringent Basel III regulatory standards in the lead-up to a 2019 deadline, alongside a new financial sector regulation bill, may impose additional costs.

The labour market will remain characterised by a strict regulatory environment, partly owing to the political power of the trade unions, and despite its negative impact on job creation. The official unemployment rate climbed to a record high of 27.7% in the first quarter of 2017-and was unchanged in the second quarter-but job creation will remain weak because of government resistance to reforms, alongside a high risk of strikes, and the obligations imposed by the labour components of BEE. A deep split in the labour movement between comparative moderates in the Congress of South African Trade Unions (an ANC ally) and a more radical tendency in the newly formed South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu), somewhat weakens the labour voice, but will also prove challenging for firms, as many unionised workers in the private sector are now members of Saftu.
Plans for a national minimum wage, to replace the current system of sectoral minimum wages, pose another potential challenge on the labour front. An advisory committee in November 2016 recommended a minimum wage of R20 (US$1.50) per hour-with partial exemptions in some sectors, to be phased in over two years-which it believes could help to alleviate poverty without denting employment. However, unions, business and government, meeting under the auspices of the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac), are struggling to conclude a final settlement, thereby adding to uncertainty.
Labour market relations have changed significantly in recent years, following the implementation of three pieces of amended legislation: the Employment Equity Act (2014), the Basic Conditions of Employment Act (2014) and the Labour Relations Act (2015). These, for the most part, are making an already difficult labour environment even more challenging by, for example, imposing new restrictions on the use of labour brokers, such as limiting temporary contracts (for low-paid workers) to a three-month maximum. The aim is to boost permanent employment, but it could prove counterproductive. A clause in the draft Labour Relations Act requiring pre-strike ballots was dropped following trade union pressure. Additional problems with the amended laws include the higher penalties and fines imposed for violations and the increased discretionary powers given to the labour minister. However, there are some inconsistencies between the various laws that have still to be tested in court. Dealing with labour issues will absorb an increasing proportion of management time.
Shortages of skilled workers will remain a key constraint
Skills shortages, exacerbated by HIV/AIDS, will remain prevalent in most sectors, pushing up the premium required to attract skilled workers and leading to the poaching of capable staff. The government, in partnership with the private sector, will maintain initiatives to boost the skills base, but progress will be slow, especially given weaknesses in the education system.

Substantial investment boosts infrastructure ranking
South Africa's infrastructure is relatively well developed, and certainly the best in Africa, although some bottlenecks and deficiencies will persist. Nonetheless, heavy and sustained public-sector investment in transport and energy-in a bid to lay the foundations for faster, long-term growth-explains the rise in South Africa's global and regional rankings for 2017-21. The dominance of parastatals restricts opportunities for private providers, although PPPs are becoming more common, in both energy and transport. Extending the Gauteng mass-transit railway (one of the largest PPPs), which opened in 2010, will continue during the outlook period. However, raising funds and deciding on end-user pricing will remain challenging, as illustrated by the long-running row over the introduction of tolls (in 2013) to finance Gauteng's highways, which continues to generate controversy.
New plant openings alleviate power shortages
Electricity shortages intensified in 2015, leading to frequent bouts of load-shedding, but the situation has improved significantly, and we expect supplies to be adequate in 2017-21, albeit at the cost of higher tariffs. Power cuts stemmed from lengthy delays in the construction of two new coal-fired plants at Medupi and Kusile-commissioned by Eskom (the parastatal power company and monopoly buyer)-but the first two of Medupi's six units have now been com-missioned and others will be phased in during the forecast period. Substantial private investment (of about US$14bn) in renewable energy (mainly wind and solar), facilitated by the Ministry of Energy, is also boosting supplies, although delays by Eskom in connecting new projects to the grid may deter new entrants. The improvement in supply from coal-fired, pumped-storage and renewable projects-alongside financial contraints-means the government's earlier plans for a new round of nuclear plant procurement are unlikely to come to fruition. Set against the benefits of a steady improvement in power supplies, electricity tariffs will continue to rise strongly in real terms-after a brief respite in 2017-imposing additional costs on firms, while also fostering a culture of energy efficiency (which presents both challenges and opportunities for business).
Ongoing construction of a domestic cable network will boost bandwidth
South Africa's telecoms market is among the most advanced in Africa in terms of technology and services provided. User costs are still comparatively high but are on a downward trend because of increased competition in all market segments. The arrival of new submarine fibre-optic cables and the ongoing construction of a domestic cable network will boost bandwidth, cut costs and promote the spread of high-end services such as broadband. A global study into cloud-computing readiness by the Business Software Alliance in 2016 ranked South Africa 14th out of 24 countries-a six-place rise. In a further boost to information and communications technology, South Africa will host the majority portion of the US$2bn Square Kilometre Array (SKA) complex, a powerful radio telescope to be situated in the Northern Cape. An initial segment opened in July 2016, to scientific acclaim, although the project will not be fully completed until 2024.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
Policymakers face the difficult task of boosting economic growth within a context of global uncertainty, while avoiding macroeconomic imbalances. Adding to the challenge, South Africa's loss of its investment-grade credit rating will dent confidence and may lead to tighter monetary policy. Fiscal policy is now less certain, but any relaxation of spending restraints, despite offering a short-term stimulus, would risk higher debts and taxes. The main medium-term challenge is to overcome structural constraints to faster growth, such as infra-structure bottlenecks and skills shortages. Targeted industrial incentives will therefore stay in place and infrastructure investment will remain a priority, although wasteful spending poses a threat. The completion of key projects will facilitate business activity later in the forecast period, but labour market rigidities will persist and anti-competitive practice policies will become stricter.
Splits in government will complicate policymaking. Outright privatisations will be rare, and foreign acquisitions of domestic entities may face close scrutiny, although opportunities will arise for public-private partnerships. Uncertainty surrounding a new foreign direct investment law (which limits recourse to international arbitration) and a new expropriation bill will weigh on sentiment, as will disputes about new mining laws. Compliance with black economic empowerment (BEE) targets will remain a challenge for corporates, especially given ongoing changes to the legal framework. The presidency's call for "radical economic transformation" will raise the level of policy uncertainty, especially in regard to BEE and land reform, to the detriment of private investment.

Budget balance -3.4 -3.2 -2.9 -2.6 -2.3 -2.0

Fiscal risks in South Africa are rising after Mr Zuma's sacking on March 31st of the respected finance minister, Mr Gordhan, and his experienced deputy, and their replacement by presidential loyalists. This potentially heralds an erosion of fiscal prudence, more frequent bail-outs for badly managed parastatals and the launch of costly, controversial and patronage-prone projects, such as nuclear power procurement. Fiscal indiscipline implies both higher public debt, which is already approaching the limits of prudence, and higher taxes. Underlining the threat, two credit rating agencies (Standard & Poor's and Fitch) cut South Africa's sovereign credit rating by one notch, from investment-grade to junk, following the reshuffle. The consequence will be a rise in the government's borrowing costs, especially for external loans, but also for rand-denominated securities-the primary source of government financing-of which a significant proportion is held by foreign investors.
The risks may not materialise in full, helped in part by the Treasury's institutional depth and the judiciary's watchdog role. Moreover, the new finance minister, Malusi Gigaba, says that the targets in the budget for fiscal year 2017/18 (April to March), prepared by his predecessor, will be respected. The budget envisages the deficit, as a proportion of GDP, falling to 3.1% in 2017/18, 2.8% in 2018/19 and 2.6% in 2019/20, including a primary surplus in each year. Practicalities suggest that the 2017/18 budget will be largely adhered to, but the risk of fiscal slippage will rise in 2018/19. The new minister's intentions will become clearer with the publication of the next medium-term budget policy statement in October. A key concern is that Mr Gigaba (unlike Mr Gordhan) lacks the authority to defy presidential instructions. Any significant retreat from fiscal consolidation would risk pushing up South Africa's public debt burden, and debt-service obligations, to injudicious levels. Our budget deficit forecasts are broadly unchanged, but any future revisions are more likely to be upward than downward.

The direction of the next interest-rate move is uncertain, after the South African Reserve Bank (SARB, the central bank) cut the benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 6.75% in July, the first reduction for five years. The factors militating against a cut include recent downgrades in South Africa's credit rating (which could lead to a weaker currency and higher inflation) and rising US interest rates. However, inflation has now returned to within the SARB's 3-6% target range, because of a moderation in food prices after last year's drought, while the rand is proving fairly resilient. This gives the SARB scope for monetary loosening, especially in view of subdued GDP growth. A faster slide in the rand could oblige the SARB to reverse the cut in 2018, but a further reduction is possible, if inflation remains within target. We now expect rates to be broadly stable (marked by small adjustments only) in 2017-19 before a modest retreat in 2020-21. The SARB will retain its inflation-targeting mandate and its independence, despite recent efforts by the presidency to hobble the institution and erode its commitment to disciplined monetary policy.

We have kept our real GDP growth forecast for 2017 at 0.8% following a recent downward revision stemming from a range of weak indicators. These include a decline in manufacturing output and stagnant retail sales (in the first five months of the year), subdued credit allocation and a slump in business confidence, especially after South Africa's recent loss of an investment-grade credit rating, and a rise in policy uncertainty. Growth will be faster than in 2016 (when expansion slowed to just 0.3%) because of a strong rebound in agriculture in most locations (after last year's crippling drought) and a mild upturn in mining, in line with global growth trends. In addition, new plant openings will lead to a further improvement in electricity supplies, and tourism is likely to post a second consecutive year of expansion. However, most other sectors will continue to struggle, amid rising levels of unemployment, subdued aggregate demand and weak private investment. The risk of a damaging metalworkers' strike also weighs on the outlook.

Our forecast for 2018, of a modest acceleration in growth to 1.8%, remains unchanged, although the risks are mainly on the downside. The impact of the credit rating downgrade, on both confidence and private investment, may become more pronounced in 2018, especially if accompanied by additional downgrades or unfavourable policy developments (such as stricter regulation and fiscal indiscipline). Conversely, an improvement in the policy outlook, sparked, for example, by the early departure of Mr Zuma, would be growth-friendly. Weak job creation will continue to suppress aggregate demand, although real-term pay rises (for those in work) and a pre-election increase in government spending will provide a modest boost.
Prospects for 2019-21 remain relatively weak but with an improving trend. Growth will remain subdued in 2019, owing to a cyclical slowdown in the US and uncertainties surrounding the next South African general election. Thereafter, growth will edge up to 2.1% in 2020 and 2.5% in 2021, helped by the completion of major infrastructure projects in transport and energy, and a US rebound. The gradual expansion of the black middle class will spur outlays on goods and services, but structural constraints such as skills shortages and inefficient para-statals will continue to dampen economic activity. A negative external balance will also weigh on economic growth throughout most of the forecast period.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
On the supply side, the services sector will remain the largest (69.6% of factor cost GDP in 2016) and will continue to be a key source of growth, although expansion will slow in 2017, before regaining some momentum in 2018-21. Retailing/wholesaling (15.3% of GDP) will face a challenging 2017 because of high unemployment and slow consumer credit uptake, although a small interest-rate cut in July may provide a modest boost, especially to the black middle class. The large banking segment (22.1% of GDP, including real estate and business services) will benefit from higher rates of financial inclusion and from a gradual uptick in GDP growth. Transport and communications (9.4% of GDP) will gain from new investment in infrastructure and fibre-optic cables. However, with a penetration rate of about 150 subscriptions per 100 people, the mobile-phone market is saturated compared with the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa, and growth will come mainly from a transition to high-end services and higher data usage. Tourism has considerable potential-based on South Africa's varied natural attractions and favourable climate-and is also a labour-intensive activity, although high levels of crime will continue to be a deterrent. Tourism rebounded in 2016, after the government started to ease the tighter visa restrictions imposed in 2014-15, and further modest growth is likely during the forecast period.
The industrial sector (28% of factor cost GDP in 2016, including mining) will remain a key part of the economy, with growth showing a broad upward trend in 2017-21, after contracting in 2016. Manufacturing (13.7% of GDP in 2016) is broad-based by Sub-Saharan African standards and will remain a key employer and source of exports, although output is set to shrink in 2017, given sluggish domestic demand and competition from cheap imports, such as steel (despite higher tariffs). The key vehicle segment will benefit from new investment, spurred by incentives offered under the Automotive Production and Development Programme (APDP), which runs to 2020 (with an extension likely), as part of the government's activist industrial policy. Power supply constraints have now eased, helped by new plant openings, but rising tariffs are a challenge. Manufacturing will continue to face an elevated risk of strikes.
Mining makes a modest and declining contribution to GDP (8.1% in 2016) but accounts, directly and indirectly, for about 50% of export earnings. This leaves South Africa highly vulnerable to commodity price fluctuations and to a slowdown in China. Mining also suffers from regulatory uncertainty and labour militancy. Delays in finalising amended mining laws and a controversial new mining charter (which tightens BEE regulations) will continue to inhibit investment. The outcome of pending legal challenges to the new rules will have a strong impact on future trends. The agricultural sector is small (2.4% of GDP in 2016) and vulnerable to drought, but will continue to make an important contribution to exports (including fruit and wine), agro-industry and employment. However, erratic rainfall poses a high degree of risk: droughts in 2015 and 2016 (partly linked to the El Niño climate phenomenon), led agriculture to contract in both years, before a strong rebound in 2017.

Unit labour costs (US$) -8.3 24.5 -2.1 2.7 7.6 7.6
Price data for the first six months support our annual average inflation forecast of 5.6% in 2017, down from a seven-year high of 6.6% in 2016, when a serious drought, coupled with brisk rand depreciation, led to a steep rise in food prices and a breach of the SARB's 3-6% target range. The situation will reverse in 2017, as a return to near-normal rainfall pushes down food price inflation. In addition, electricity tariffs will rise by less than the headline rate of inflation for the first time in ten years. Modest rand strengthening in the first half of 2017 is also curbing inflation, although depreciation will gain fresh momentum in the second half, because of high levels of political and policy uncertainty.
Inflation will average 5.5% a year in 2018-21, thereby meeting the SARB's target, despite temporary breaches. Factors keeping inflation in check include prudent monetary policy, spare industrial capacity, slack demand, stricter competition laws and efficiency gains arising from infrastructure investment. However, real-term rises in power tariffs (from 2018 onwards) and higher real wages for those in work will prevent inflation from falling more sharply. In addition, inflation risks stemming from rand depreciation will remain elevated.

The rand weakened slightly to R13.14:US$1 in July (from R12.89:US$1 in June) but remained stronger than a year earlier (by 8.9%). In contrast to brisk rand depreciation in 2016, the currency has been comparatively stable in 2017 to date, averaging R13.21:US$1 in the first seven months of the year, despite a string of adverse developments, such as the loss of South Africa's investment-grade credit rating (downgraded by two rating agencies) in April, and a high degree of political and policy uncertainty. However, despite temporary dips, the rand has proved surprisingly resilient, helped by a more favourable global monetary environment for emerging-market currencies: increases in US interest rates, for example, will be gradual, not rapid. The rand is also finding support from a mild upturn in mineral markets. The rand will, nonetheless, remain vulnerable to local and global uncertainties, leading to a quicker rate of depreciation in the second half of 2017, ahead of the ruling party's electoral summit in December, and the next round of assessments by rating agencies. Despite a renewed slide, we are again revising our annual exchange-rate forecast for 2017 to R13.67:US$1 (marking a first year of appreciation since 2011). We expect the rand to average R16.12:US$1 in 2018, before a more gradual fall to R20.5:US$1 in 2021.

The current-account deficit will widen slightly to 3.8% of GDP in 2017 and 4.4% of GDP in 2018. Export growth will be fairly healthy in 2017-18, thanks largely to a modest upturn in mineral markets. Non-mineral exports (such as cars) will benefit from South Africa's retention of trade preferences under the US African Growth and Opportunity Act. Import growth will similarly rise in 2017-18, underpinned by costlier oil and capital equipment for infrastructure projects-pushing the trade balance back into deficit (after a rare surplus in 2016)-although consequent improvements in logistics capacity and power supply will facilitate exports in the medium term. Notably, the invisibles deficit (on services, income and current transfers) will remain far wider than the goods deficit and will account for most of the current-account shortfall throughout the forecast period. Income payments to foreign investors and transfers to fellow members of the Southern African Customs Union will offset growth in tourism inflows and income earned by outward investors. Projections for 2019-21 show the current-account deficit fluctuating within a range of 4.3-4.6% of GDP, with the annual variation largely attributable to shifts in domestic and global growth trends.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in South Africa
Stocks and flows
South Africa is a prime destination for non-oil-sector foreign direct investment (FDI) in Sub-Saharan Africa. Inflows averaged US$4.5bn a year in 2012-16, although annual figures can vary substantially because of the discontinuous nature of FDI. Inflows peaked at a record of US$9.9bn in 2008, boosted by the US$5.2bn purchase of a 20% stake in Standard Bank by China's state-run Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC)-the second-biggest FDI deal to date-behind the acquisition of 56% of ABSA by Barclays (UK) in 2005. Eight years later, in 2013, Barclays brought together most of its African operations, including ABSA, under the Barclays Africa banner, before subsequently announcing its withdrawal from Africa (in 2016), as part of a global restructuring exercise. The sale of Barclays' majority stake in Barclays Africa, primarily to local investors, was completed in June 2017. FDI regained momentum after the 2009 recession, rising to US$4.6bn in 2012, buoyed by the purchase by Walmart (US) of 51% of Massmart, for US$2.4bn. Inflows jumped to US$8.2bn in 2013, before retreating to US$5.8bn in 2014, although South Africa was Sub-Saharan Africa's leading recipient of FDI in both years. A dip to US$1.5bn in 2015, before a modest rebound to US$2.3bn in 2016, reflects heightened investor concerns over domestic and global prospects. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects FDI to be fairly buoyant during the forecast period, averaging US$3.7bn a year in 2017-21 (and rising towards the end of the period), helped in part by South Africa's status as a gateway to Sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa is also a major outward investor, especially in Africa, where local firms have a presence in a wide range of sectors, including services and infrastructure, as well as in more traditional natural resource exploitation. Outward FDI climbed to US$7.7bn in 2014, before ebbing to US$5.5bn in 2015 and US$3.3bn in 2016, thereby surpassing inward FDI in all three years.
Origin and distribution
The UK remains a key source of FDI, illustrated by deals with Vodafone and Barclays in recent years, alongside other significant investors such as Germany (Mercedes-Benz and BMW) and the US (Coca-Cola, Ford and Walmart). Investment from non-traditional sources, especially China (ICBC) and India (Tata and Cipla), is growing strongly. Banking, telecommunications, tourism, real estate, mining and manufacturing are the most attractive sectors. FDI in South Africa includes greenfield projects-in motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals, food-processing, information technology and beverages-and buy-outs of existing firms (such as Massmart). The economically powerful Gauteng province receives the bulk of inward FDI, followed by the Eastern Cape (including the Coega industrial zone), KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape, but the other five provinces attract less interest.
Determinants
Several factors drive inward investment, including South Africa's status as the most advanced economy in Sub-Saharan Africa (with close links to several other regional markets), a sizeable domestic market of 56m people (in 2016), strong tourism potential and world-class mineral wealth. South Africa's preferential access to the EU market, via a new economic partnership agreement (EPA) concluded in 2014, and to the US market, under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which has been extended by ten years to 2025, also helps to support investment. Ongoing efforts to tackle infrastructure deficiencies in energy and transport will serve as an additional spur to FDI. Set against this are a number of deterrents, including a high degree of policy uncertainty, labour-market rigidity (and strikes), skills shortages, widespread crime and the dominant position of parastatals in several some sectors. Key areas of policy uncertainty include a tough new mining charter, a pending new FDI law that limits recourse to international arbitration and a draft expropriation bill that could affect levels of compensation. Privatisation prospects are limited, although there will be openings for independent operators and public-private partnerships, mainly in energy and transport.
Impact
FDI has a strong positive impact in South Africa, especially in key sectors such as automotive, telecoms, banking and mining, and has played a key role in boosting exports, facilitating growth and lifting employment. FDI provides capital, allows for the transfer of technology and skills and binds South Africa more closely to the global economy.
Potential
We expect inflows to rise steadily during the forecast period, from US$2.4bn in 2017 to US$4.9bn in 2021, helped by a pick-up in local growth, but global and domestic risks are significant. The impact on global trade and commodity prices of the Trump presidency in the US, the UK's intention to leave the EU (Brexit) and a slowdown in China all have the potential to impede investment flows. Policy uncertainty in South Africa over a range of issues will also inhibit investment, especially in mining. Inflows will, nonetheless, benefit from the government's activist industrial policy, especially in the automotive segment, and from the improvement in electricity supplies in 2017-21, which will allow for new investment in energy-intensive sectors. The retention of South Africa's AGOA status, after the settlement of a dispute about US meat imports, will also facilitate inflows, as will closer regional integration within the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The rollout of a domestic cable network will boost bandwidth and cut costs, helping to create a more accommodating environment for cloud computing and business-process outsourcing (given an English-speaking, educated workforce in a similar time zone to the EU). South Africa will remain a key base for companies with pan-African operations by offering a range of services, including banking, capital-raising and trade-related functions.

South Africa's consumer market is in the midst of a major transformation as the poor black majority is increasingly drawn into the mainstream commercial economy. The speed of the change will be determined by both the global and local economies, and by the effectiveness of government policies against poverty and unemployment. Notably, South Africa remains among the most unequal societies in the world, and many of these divisions are based on race (the legacy of apartheid). Race-based distinctions between upper- and lower-income groups will remain significant but will decline over time. The most recent income and expenditure survey shows that spending by black households (76.6% of the total) rose by 35% in real terms between fiscal years 2005/06 and 2010/11 (April-March), to R55,920 per household (US$7,700 at the prevailing exchange rate). By comparison, spending by mixed-race and white households rose by 21.8% (to R97,965) and by 16.1% (to R314,524) respectively. This shows that black spending is growing more quickly than white spending, but the absolute gap will remain large. Around 35% of households are currently categorised as middle class, but this will rise steadily during the forecast period.
Consumer spending will show a broad upward trend
Household spending growth in real terms was brisk following the 2009 recession, peaking at 5.1% in 2011, before trending lower to 1.7% in 2015 and 0.8% in 2016, the weakest rate since 2009. The downturn reflects high levels of household indebtedness, rising interest rates during the period, weak job creation and wages lost to strikes. Demand was also negatively affected by a severe drought in 2016, when household consumption of goods shrank by 0.1% (pulled down by a 7.3% contraction in durables), although consumption of services grew by 2.1%. The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts a further decline in real consumption growth to 0.5% in 2017 (in line with rising unemployment), but we expect a gentle rebound during the remainder of the forecast period, helped by faster overall growth, more generous welfare payments, rising real wages (for those in work), higher levels of financial inclusion and the expansion of the black middle class.
Consumer spending will also benefit from the expansion of low-cost housing and electrification-which will boost demand for ancillary goods and services-and from the adoption of a more broad-based approach to black economic empowerment (BEE). The benefits of BEE have been spread narrowly to date, helping to create a new black elite (the so-called black diamonds, who generally display similar consumption patterns to rich whites). However, the drive towards more broad-based BEE, including employee share-ownership schemes and a focus on suppliers, may spread the gains more widely. This will facilitate the expansion of the black middle class, as well as boosting poorer market segments. Low-income households will also benefit from a steady rise in welfare payments. "Demonstration effect" purchasing by new middle-class entrants and blue-collar workers-and easier access to and greater reliance on credit-will expand markets for more expensive retail goods such as electrical appliances. The spread of modern shopping centres will reinforce the trend. The entry of Walmart (US) into the retail market in 2011, via its purchase of a majority stake in a local retailer, Massmart, is increasing competition in the retail sector, to the benefit of consumers.

Consumer expenditure will show a broad upward trend over the forecast period (at least in rand, if not in US dollar, terms), although the composition of consumption will not change radically. Food spending typically falls as a proportion of total spending as disposable income rises, but this will not be evident in 2017-21 because of the entry of subsistence-level rural dwellers into the commercial economy, the rise in the spending power of lower-income groups (which typically spend more of their money on food) and growing demand by the emergent middle class for higher-value-added food products. The share of total spending accounted for by housing (and household fuels) and will edge higher in 2017-21, because of costlier electricity, but most other categories will show little relative change, including leisure and education, clothing and footwear, health, and transport and communications.

Growth of capital stock 3.1 4.2 3.7
Total factor productivity growth 1.1 1.6 1.4
Initial conditions: Growth will revive gradually in 2017-21, underpinned by a modest pick-up in the global economy and an end to electricity shortages, although the outlook for commodity prices is mixed. Investment will strengthen, especially in infrastructure, although the public sector is hampered by fiscal constraints, and private-sector confidence is currently low (because of policy uncertainties). These factors also point to weak job creation. An interest-rate cut in July 2017 may give a small boost to growth, provided the reduction is not reversed in response to expected rand depreciation, which could stoke inflation. Structural constraints will persist into the medium term, including infrastructure bottlenecks, skills shortages and labour market rigidity. The threats posed by labour militancy and strike action are additional challenges, meaning that growth will remain sluggish, despite trending upwards.
The impact of HIV/AIDS will gradually dissipate in 2031-50
Demographic trends: South Africa's population will continue to grow at a slow pace, held back by the impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which may persist for another generation. However, the downward trend in new infections and deaths attributable to AIDS, and the ongoing rollout of treatment programmes, will reduce the impact of the disease in 2031-50. This will be accompanied by increased life expectancy, although overall population growth will remain relatively muted, as rising disposable incomes and urbanisation will lead to smaller families. The working-age population and the labour force will grow more quickly than the overall population, because of the high proportion of young people and inward migration from other African states. This will make it harder to bring down the unemployment rate. Another key demographic trend will be the rise in the proportion of urban dwellers, from 65.3% in 2016 to 80% in 2050.
External conditions: South Africa's performance, as a relatively small and open economy that is strongly reliant on mineral exports, will remain closely tied to world trends. This leaves South Africa vulnerable to disruptions linked to the Trump presidency in the US, the UK's intention to leave the EU (Brexit) and a Chinese slowdown. Multilateral trade liberalisation under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation may yield benefits, although the slow pace of progress means that freer trade will mainly be driven by bilateral and regional initiatives in the medium term. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) will progressively implement a free-trade area, although ambitions for a customs union, a common market and monetary union may not be realised until after 2030 because of economic and policy divergences between member states. Intra-African trade will continue to be held back by non-tariff barriers and weak infrastructure in 2015-30, but these constraints will ease in 2031-50. Ties with the EU will continue to deepen, following agreement on a new economic partnership agreement (EPA) in 2014. South Africa will retain preferential access to the US market-given the extension of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) until 2025-although its eligibility will be subject to periodic reviews. South Africa's trade and investment ties with non-OECD states, especially fellow BRICS members (Brazil, Russia, India and China) will deepen over the long term, at the expense of traditional links with OECD partners
The quality of institutions will improve
Institutions and policy trends: The quality of institutions will improve, boosting transparency and accountability, but capacity constraints will persist, especially at provincial and municipal levels. Key institutions, such as the central bank and the judiciary, will retain their independence. The broad policy framework-which is based on a partnership between private business and the "developmental state"-will remain intact. In broad terms, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects moderate, centrist voices to prevail in the policy debate in the longer term, at the expense of pro-patronage forces and the interventionist left. The process will be helped by political realignments that could see the fragmentation of the ruling tripartite alliance-comprising the African National Congress (ANC), the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the South African Communist Party-and the emergence of a new coalition between moderates in the ANC and the opposition. Many current policy challenges will persist into the longer term, including skills shortages, high unemployment and the thorny issue of land reform, although investment will alleviate infrastructure constraints.
Productivity gains will boost growth in the longer term
Long-term performance: We forecast that real GDP growth will average 3.1% a year in 2017-30, helped by rising life expectancy, improved electricity supplies, the expansion of the black middle class, regional integration and global demand for commodities. Major infrastructure investments either under way or planned, and the gradual implementation of the National Development Plan, will underpin business activity, although slow population growth will serve as a constraint. Growth will quicken to 3.7% a year in 2031-50, driven by technological advances such as additive printing and cloud computing. Growth in capital stocks will outpace growth in labour productivity throughout the period, owing to a combination of skills shortages and investment in new technology.

Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines ten separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, and infrastructure. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 16 (infrastructure), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2012-16) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2017-21). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2012-16. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2017-21 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
The main sources used in the business rankings model include CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce; Freedom House, Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties; Heritage Foundation, Index of Economic Freedom; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; UN, Human Development Report; US Social Security Administration, Social Security Programs Throughout the World; World Bank, World Development Report; World Development Indicators; Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Report.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2012-16 ranges are then used to derive 2017-21 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2017-21, not to the likely situation in 2021 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2014 or 2019). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Abstract: According to government plans, tax revenue, including social security contributions, will be about 33% of GDP in 2017, compared with an OECD average of about 35% (2015 data). According to balance-of-payments statistics, inflows of FDI, including sales of real estate to non-residents, declined to around US$13bn, or 1.4% of GDP, per year in 2012-14, before picking up to US$17.6bn, or 2% of GDP, in 2015. From 2008, although the government remained willing to privatise, market conditions deteriorated, resulting in less interest from foreign investors. Since 2013 potential deterrents have multiplied: less buoyant economic growth, mass anti-government protests, financial market volatility, government corruption allegations, the spillover of violence from the conflict in Syria and, most recently, the collapse of the peace negotiations with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and an attempted military coup in July 2016. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (Turkstat), greater Istanbul, which accounts for about one-fifth of the population, represents about one-quarter of household consumption expenditure.

Full text: Turkey--highlights: Political outlook
The intense political instability that followed the failed coup by parts of the military in July 2016 has eased partially since the approval in a referendum in April 2017 of a set of constitutional changes designed to replace Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidency. However, the narrow referendum victory and allegations of vote fraud have deepened social and political divisions. The presidential reform, which will take effect after the next presidential and parliamentary elections, both due in 2019, will further undermine Turkey's fragile democratic institutions and governance structures. It provides few checks and balances on the powers of the president, and moves the country closer to one-man rule by the incumbent president and leader of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

The total population is projected to rise from an estimated 79.5m in 2016 to 84.5m in 2021, with the female population continuing to outnumber the male population. The total population is expected to grow by about 1.2% per year during the forecast period (2017-21), compared with 1.6% during the historical period (2012-16).

The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment score for Turkey deteriorates only slightly in the forecast period (2017-21), but the country's global ranking falls by 12 places, to 58th. There is a consensus among policymakers on the need to maintain macroeconomic stability. However, domestic political tension has created uncertainty about the direction of policy. Turkey lags most central and east European countries for foreign direct investment (FDI). Important shortcomings are a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion. Adding to these problems is the impact of the failed coup on the business environment. The government has used emergency powers to seize or close almost 1,000 firms suspected of having links to the Gulenist movement. Foreign companies' assets have not been seized, but reports in July 2017 indicated that some 600-700 German companies had been under investigation. The seized firms, which are being administered by the state through the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund, will be sold off.

Exchange rate TL:US$ (av) 3.0 3.6 3.7 3.9 4.0 4.1
Real GDP growth slowed from an annual average of 7.4% in 2010-15 to 3% in 2016, in part owing to the disruption to the economy from the failed coup but also because of faltering foreign capital inflows amid expectations of global liquidity tightening. A recovery got under way in the final quarter of 2016, supported by government stimulus measures, political pressure on banks to extend credit and a pick-up in global demand. We expect growth to accelerate to 4.5% in 2017 and to an average of 4.1% in 2018-21. The central government deficit, which captures most of the public sector, is forecast to widen from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to an average of 2.2% of GDP per year in 2017-19, before narrowing to 1.7% in 2021. The government debt/GDP ratio has edged up slightly, but we expect it to remain around 30% in 2017-21. We expect the Central Bank of Turkey to have to keep its monetary policy tight in the remainder of 2017 and in 2018 to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent a further depreciation of the lira.

The large consumer market is one of Turkey's chief attractions as a place to do business. The population is young, growing and inclined to consume rather than save, and average incomes are rising steadily in local currency terms. Income distribution is uneven by European standards. We expect GDP per head to rise from US$24,270 at purchasing power parity (PPP) rates in 2016 to about US$30,500 in 2021. GDP per head in Turkey will be about 65% of the EU28 average, an increase of about 7 percentage points in ten years.

Growth of real GDP per head 3.0 2.0 2.4
Growth of real GDP 3.8 2.4 3.0
Labour productivity growth 2.4 2.0 2.1
Turkey's economic growth performance is expected to surpass that of the EU28, as a result of its more favourable demographic profile and larger productivity increases. However, at an average of 3% per year in 2017-50, real GDP growth will be well below the performance recorded in 2004-07 and 2010-15. Improvements in the policy environment could produce substantially better results, but there is still uncertainty about the impact of changes to Turkey's political and institutional framework and the country's commitment to seeing through the reforms required under the EU accession process.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West, becoming a member of the Council of Europe (1949) and NATO (1952), and signing an association agreement with the then European Community (1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but the coup at-tempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey has a unicameral parliamentary system of government with parliament elected for a four-year term. To win seats parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Under the AKP, Turkey is moving towards a presidential system of government, which will come into effect by late 2019, and possibly earlier. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability is Turkey's biggest policy challenge. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and changing global liquidity conditions will require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy relatively tight to attract adequate capital inflows. The Kurdish problem, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is one of Turkey's most pressing political issues, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015 and there has been a resurgence in violence. The failed coup highlighted long-standing institutional weaknesses, which, with the AKP's consent until 2013, allowed the secretive Gulenist movement to infiltrate the state. Further politicisation of the judiciary is likely after the coup attempt. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The basic rate of corporation tax is 20%. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Tax reform to reduce evasion was one of the main elements of previous IMF reform programmes but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2016 goods exports (fob) came to US$150.2bn and imports (fob) to US$191bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$40.9bn-a contraction from US$48.1bn in 2015. The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

The religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) scored a landslide victory in the snap parliamentary election on November 1st 2015, winning almost 50% of the vote and restoring its majority in parliament (317 seats out of a total of 550), which it had lost in the poll in June. The result ended months of domestic political uncertainty and sealed the dominance of Turkish politics by the AKP and the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The AKP did not win the minimum 330-seat super-majority needed to revise the constitution, but following the failed coup in July 2016 the Nationalist Action Party (MHP) agreed to back the AKP's constitutional reform bill designed to replace Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidency. The presidential reform, which was put to a referendum in April 2017, was narrowly approved amid allegations of vote fraud and will take effect after the next parliamentary and presidential elections due to take place by late 2019.
Political outlook: Political stability
The intense political instability that followed the failed coup by parts of the military in July 2016 has eased partially since the approval in a referendum in April 2017 of a set of constitutional changes designed to replace Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidency. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit maintains its negative medium-term political outlook. The narrow referendum victory and allegations of vote fraud have deepened the social and political divisions. The "justice march" from the capital, Ankara, to Istanbul, headed by Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), ended peacefully on July 9th, but further protests are likely, keeping high the risk of clashes between protesters and pro-government supporters or a government clampdown. The presidential reform, which will take effect after the next presidential and parliamentary elections, both due in 2019, will further undermine Turkey's fragile democratic institutions and governance structures. It provides few checks and balances on the powers of the president, and moves the country closer to one-man rule by Mr Erdogan.
Mr Erdogan and the AKP have continued to tighten their grip on power. The state of emergency law introduced after the failed coup has been repeatedly extended on a three-month basis. We expect it remain in place for the foresee-able future, because it will effectively allow Mr Erdogan to govern as a president with executive powers until the new system of government is fully in place.
Emergency rule was initially introduced to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. However, the use of these powers has been extended to eliminate the pro-Kurdish political opposition, which the government accuses of having links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), and silence government critics. More than 100,000 people-mainly in the judiciary, the military, the police, academic institutions and the media-have so far been suspended, dismissed or detained.
Security risk remains high, with negative implications for the economy. The state is seeking to end an insurgency by the PKK in the south-east of Turkey, address the domestic security risk posed by terrorist attacks by Kurdish militants and Islamic State (IS) in cities across the country, and implement military operations in Syria and Iraq against both IS and the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds. The purge of the Turkish armed forces and the police since the attempted coup has created operational capacity problems and contributed to intelligence failures that have exacerbated Turkey's domestic security issues. In the short to medium term neither the government nor the PKK appears to be interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will intensify.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
For much of the AKP's 15 years of single-party rule, political and government effectiveness have improved. The economy has been well managed and significant social reforms, notably the healthcare reform, have been implemented. However, in recent years, domestic power struggles have intensified, resulting in a resurgence of violence since mid-2015 and a failed coup attempt in mid-July 2016. The power struggles and related violence have weakened government effectiveness and Turkey's democratic institutions. In response to the failed coup the government introduced emergency rule, which has remained in place, allowing the government to carry out an extensive purge of personnel in the military, the judiciary, the police force and academic institutions suspected of having Gulenist links. The extent of the purge risks undermining institutional capacity on a lasting basis.
Since 2013 economic policymaking institutions have become increasingly politicised. In 2017 pressure from Mr Erdogan and other members of the AKP on the Central Bank of Turkey to lower official interest rates has eased-they have focused their attention increasingly on Turkey's private-sector commercial banks-but it could resume at any time despite above-target inflation following a sharp slide in the value of the Turkish lira in late 2016/early 2017.
Concerns about judicial impartiality and efficiency unlikely to be resolved
Concerns about the impartiality and efficiency of the legal system are unlikely to be resolved over the forecast period, given the continued politicisation of the judiciary. An AKP constitutional reform package, which was approved by referendum in 2010, changed the appointment procedure and composition of the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and the Constitutional Court. The changes facilitated the replacement of conservative secularist-nationalists in the judiciary with Gulenists, who until 2013 were close allies of the AKP. Shortcomings in the judicial process were highlighted in coup plot investigations and trials that began in 2007. These were only addressed at appeal stage, and after suspected Gulenists in the judiciary began investigating allegations of government corruption in late 2013. The purge of Gulenists from the judiciary accelerated after the failed coup. Their replacements will probably be chosen for their loyalty to Mr Erdogan and the AKP, possibly from other religious sects. The upheaval is likely to increase uncertainty in the judicial process and prolong cases further. The courts' tendency to interpret the law in favour of the state and at the expense of the individual is unlikely to change, especially in cases involving minority rights and freedom of speech.
Foreign businesses operating in Turkey can reduce some of the uncertainty caused by the legal process by incorporating international arbitration clauses into their contracts. These help to shorten the time that it takes to resolve commercial dis-putes and prevent, in most cases, the need for intervention by the Turkish courts.
Corruption in the public sector is seen as a major deterrent by potential international investors. Legislation has been introduced to tackle it. However, implementation will continue to be a problem and political patronage is likely to remain widespread. The public procurement law of 2003 was drafted to meet EU standards, but has since been watered down and amended so that important sectors, such as transport and energy, were excluded. Turkey has improved compliance with the OECD's anti-bribery convention.
Political outlook: Election watch
The next parliamentary and presidential elections are due to be held in 2019, but they could be earlier if Mr Erdogan decides to accelerate the transfer of executive powers to the presidency once the institutions and instruments of the new presidential system are in place. Given the popularity of the president, and his party's ability to control the election process, we expect Mr Erdogan to win the presidential election and to remain in office with enhanced powers for at least one more five-year term, if not two (the maximum allowed), up to 2029. His popularity is unrivalled, and the opposition is fragmented and currently appears to have no candidates capable of challenging him. In 2014 Mr Erdogan won the presidential election in the first round with just over 50% of the vote against a joint candidate presented by the CHP and the right-wing MHP. The MHP's support in parliament for the presidential reform makes it unlikely that either of the two parties will consider fielding a joint candidate at the next election.
The clampdown on the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) since mid-2015, the MHP leadership's decision to back the presidential reform, and the hardline nationalist stance adopted by Mr Erdogan and the AKP could have a considerable effect on voting patterns at the next parliamentary election. Both the MHP and the HDP have been weakened since the 2015 election and run the risk of falling below the high 10% national vote threshold for parliamentary representation, which would boost the AKP's seat share. Under the consti-tutional changes approved in the referendum, there will be 600 seats in a much weakened parliament from the next election, up from 550 currently.
The next local elections are scheduled to take place by March 2019.
Political outlook: Key players to watch
Recep Tayyip Erdogan
Mr Erdogan, who became Turkey's first directly elected president in August 2014, has completely dominated the political scene since the 2002 general election. Under his leadership, the Justice and Development Party (AKP) that he co-founded in 2001 comfortably won general elections in 2002, 2007 and 2011. This was largely owing to the comparative economic stability that the AKP delivered, but Mr Erdogan's personal appeal was instrumental, as was his religious and conservative outlook, which is shared by much of the electorate, but not by the AKP's political opponents. After the AKP unexpectedly lost its parliamentary majority at the general election in June 2015, Mr Erdogan adopted a more confrontational stance, which contributed to a deterioration in the political and security environment. The shift coincided with a collapse in the peace process with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), leading to a reversion to a military strategy against the PKK. Mr Erdogan's roots in political Islam have prompted his secularist opponents in the military and judiciary to try to unseat him on several occasions. All such challenges have been rebuffed. So, too, were mass protests against his rule in mid-2013, and allegations from erstwhile Islamic allies of corruption in his government. He only narrowly escaped capture and possibly even death on the night of the attempted coup on July 15th 2016. The failed coup is likely to mark another important step in Mr Erdogan's efforts to stifle dissent, weaken checks and balances, and concentrate power in his own hands. It has helped him to accelerate his plans to replace the parliament system of government with an executive presidency.
Binali Yildirim
Mr Yildirim became prime minister after his appointment as leader of the AKP on May 22nd 2016. Handpicked by Mr Erdogan, he replaced Ahmet Davutoglu when Mr Davutoglu resigned following a fallout with the president. Mr Yildirim has been a close ally of the president since 1994, when Mr Erdogan became mayor of Istanbul. He was one of the longest-serving members of the cabinet during Mr Erdogan's time as prime minister in 2003-14. On his appointment Mr Yildirim placed renewed emphasis on implementing the transition to a presidential system of government to end the ambiguity around Mr Erdogan's role, which under the 1982 constitution was supposed to be largely ceremonial and above party politics. This was superseded by changes to the constitution approved by referendum in April 2017. Mr Yildirim stepped down as party leader in May 2017 so that Mr Erdogan could be re-elected, uncontested, as chairman of the AKP.
Kemal Kilicdaroglu
Mr Kilicdaroglu became leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) just over a year before the 2011 general election in which he was well beaten by Mr Erdogan. Mr Kilicdaroglu is a less divisive figure than his predecessor, Deniz Baykal, but he lacks the political presence or skills of Mr Erdogan. The CHP's problems are not merely questions of personnel. As it stands, the party looks incapable of ever again marshalling sufficient support to win a national election. Under Mr Kilicdaroglu the CHP unsuccessfully opposed Mr Erdogan's push to establish an executive presidency. Following the April presidential reform referendum, the CHP called for the result to be nullified over allegations of electoral fraud, but failed to harness widespread public concern about the referendum campaign and outcome. However, Mr Kilicdaroglo's "justice" march from Ankara to Istanbul in June-July 2017 to protest against the jailing of a CHP member of parliament was the single boldest expression of opposition activism during the AKP's 15-year rule, but its galvanising effect on the opposition to Mr Erdogan already appears to have faded.
Devlet Bahceli
Mr Bahceli has been leader of the opposition Nationalist Action Party (MHP) since 1997 after the death of its founder, Colonel Alparslan Turkes. Calls from within the party for a change of leadership intensified following the MHP's poor performance in the November 2015 general election, but amid the increased political uncertainty of the post-coup-attempt environment his main challenger, Meral Aksener, was expelled from the party in early September 2016, effectively ending any possibility of a change of party leadership. While a junior partner in a broad left-right coalition government in 1999-2002, Mr Bahceli tried to move the party from the extreme right to the right-of-centre, showing a willingness to compromise on some sensitive issues such as the abolition of the death penalty and increased protection of minority rights for the Kurds as required by the EU for the opening of EU membership negotiations. This transition has been reversed since the party returned to opposition, especially on the Kurdish issue. Mr Bahceli and his party strongly opposed the AKP government's peace negotiations with the PKK. After the collapse of the process in mid-2015 and the AKP's reversion to a military security strategy against the PKK, the differences between the AKP and the MHP leadership narrowed considerably, resulting in the MHP leadership deciding to back Mr Erdogan's presidential reform plans.
Political outlook: International relations
Since the failed coup Turkish foreign policy has been heavily conditioned by Mr Erdogan's domestic political goals, notably his push to establish a presidential system of government. This approach, combined with ongoing political upheaval in Europe and the US, has resulted in a marked deterioration in Turkey's inter-national relations with its traditional Western allies.
Having deployed armed forces to back rebel groups in Syria to fight IS and prevent the expansion of territory held by US-backed, PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurds, Turkey risks becoming embroiled in the conflict. Tensions and the risk of confrontation between Turkey and US-backed forces could escalate once IS is defeated. The US administration appears unlikely to grant Turkey's request for Mr Gulen to be extradited from the US to face trial in Turkey on charges of masterminding the failed coup. Even if the AKP government provides evidence of his role in the coup that would stand up in a US court, there would be a strong chance that his extradition would be rejected on the grounds that he might not get a fair trial in Turkey.
Despite talk of agreeing a new roadmap to ease tensions and improve co-operation in the main areas of interest such as security, trade and investment, neither Turkey nor the EU is genuinely interested in Turkish membership of the bloc anymore. However, neither has yet been willing to suspend negotiations unilaterally. If Turkey reintroduces the death penalty, as Mr Erdogan has suggested, the EU might not be able to avoid suspending the process. The sus-pension of accession negotiations would almost certainly prompt Turkey to end its collaboration with the EU to stem the movement of migrants and refugees into Europe. A settlement of the de facto division of Cyprus between the Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north could help to improve Turkey's relations with the EU, but talks collapsed in July 2017. We maintain our forecast that a settlement is unlikely during the forecast period (2017-21).
Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved. Russia has lifted almost all sanctions, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly in relation to the conflict in Syria, where both are militarily involved but are pursuing contrasting goals. We expect relations to remain largely transactional, and the risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.

Population growth remains high by European standards
Turkey is the third-largest country by population in Europe, after Russia and Germany. Official population figures have been compiled using an address-based registry since 2009. These figures are lower than previous estimates from door-to-door censuses, but are believed to be more reliable. The total population is projected to rise from an estimated 79.5m in 2016 to 84.5m in 2021, with the female population continuing to outnumber the male population. The total population is expected to grow by about 1.2% per year during the forecast period (2017-21), compared with 1.6% during the historical period (2012-16). The pace of population growth has slowed in recent decades, mostly owing to the declining birth rate, which in turn reflects the combined impact on fertility rates of urbanisation, an improvement in the education level of women and wider use of birth control. Nevertheless, population growth remains high by European standards.
From an average of 17.5 births per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012-16, the crude birth rate is expected to fall to an average of 16.1 per 1,000 in 2017-21. The infant mortality rate will continue to decline, but will remain high in comparison with European countries, as the national average is pulled up by the south-east and east regions, as well as by rural areas. The crude death rate will remain broadly unchanged, at an average of 5.8 per 1,000 population in 2017-21.
Although ageing, the Turkish population is young in a European context and will remain so throughout the forecast period. In 2016 those aged 14 and under were estimated to comprise 25.4% of the population and the 65-plus age group accounted for just 7.7%. In 2021 the share of under-15s will still be high, at about 23.3% of the population, and the over-65s are expected to account for 9.1%.
The urban population, which is currently estimated at 73.9%, will rise further as rural families, insufficiently supported by agriculture, continue to seek better living standards in towns and cities. The drift of population from smaller and poorer urban settlements to larger and richer ones will also continue. As a result, all major cities in the west and south (including Ankara) will continue to grow rapidly. Although earthquake-prone, Istanbul and its surrounding area is likely to become the largest conurbation in Europe-the population was already 14.8m at end-2016, up from about 11m at end-2007. Other cities and towns to witness particularly strong population growth include prosperous industrial centres like Bursa and Konya, and Antalya, on the Mediterranean coast.
The population of the Kurdish-inhabited south-east, which accounts for about 10% of the total population, has increased steadily, despite strong outward migration. The still-high natural population growth rate in the region will contribute to the rapid expansion of the populations of cities like Gaziantep, Sanliurfa and Diyarbakir. By contrast, the populations of many rural areas in northern, eastern and central Turkey will dwindle. Even some of the larger urban centres in these poorer and more remote regions could lose population as birth rates slow and migration westwards and southwards continues. This could possibly be accelerated in the south-east by the eruption of violence since mid-2015, which has pushed the conflict between the state and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) close to the level of its most violent days in the 1990s. Some western and southern areas that are still classed as rural may maintain their populations as a result of intensive agriculture, tourism and/or proximity to major cities. This may also be true of lowland parts of the south-east benefiting from irrigation schemes.
Participation rates will remain well below the OECD average
Despite solid growth in the population of working age, Turkey has the lowest labour force participation rate of any OECD country. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (Turkstat), it averaged 52% in 2016 (just under 72% for men, 32.5% for women) compared with an OECD average rate of over 70%. Participation rates in urban areas are lower than in rural areas, reflecting that rural women are typically classified as "unpaid family workers" and are, therefore, counted as workforce participants and employed persons. Low workforce participation rates among urban women probably reflect inadequate job opportunities and the persistence of traditional gender roles. This situation is changing slowly, as illustrated by a gradual rise in recent years in the urban female participation rate. However, the rate is expected to remain low by European standards throughout the forecast period.

The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment score for Turkey deteriorates slightly in the forecast period (2017-21), but its global ranking falls by 12 places, to 58th. There is a consensus among policymakers on the need to maintain macroeconomic stability. However, domestic political tension has created uncertainty, which has deepened since the failed coup on July 15th 2016, about the direction of policy. Turkey lags most central and east European countries for foreign direct investment (FDI). Important shortcomings are a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion. There is a also risk of macroeconomic volatility, stemming from Turkey's heavy dependence on external finance for growth and the prospect of less abundant global liquidity in the coming years.
Domestic political tension has created uncertainty about the direction of policy
Adding to these problems is the impact of the failed coup on the business environment. The government has used emergency powers to seize or close almost 1,000 firms suspected of having links to the Gulenist movement. Foreign companies' assets have not been seized, but reports in July 2017 indicated that some 600-700 German companies had been under investigation. The seized firms being administered by the state through the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund will be sold off.
Major attractions for investors include Turkey's geographic location, the size of the potential market, its young and growing population, a customs union with the EU, free foreign-exchange and capital flows, and a large and dynamic private sector. The public finances are in good health and the financial system is well capitalised and regulated. We expect improvements in the quality of infrastructure. A wave of post-coup suspensions and dismissals in the civil service may weaken institutional capacity for some years to come, both at regulatory bodies and in the judiciary.
Business environment outlook: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Privatisations are likely to be delayed amid the post-coup upheaval in the state institutions. Some companies, notably those with media holdings or ties with the Gulenist movement, remain subject to heavy-handed state intervention.
2019-21: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in a wide range of sectors, although the opening-up of the energy market makes progress.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2019-21: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Capital controls are not considered. There is a boost to trade and tourism following the lifting of Russian sanctions. Possible increase in protectionism under the new US administration.
2019-21: Customs union with the EU could be extended, but negotiations are likely to be protracted given the deterioration in Turkish-EU relations. More free-trade agreements may come into force with the EU's trading partners.
Taxes
2017-18: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make some progress. Tax rates are largely unchanged.
2019-21: A broader income tax base as exemptions and exceptions are reduced. Possible tax cuts and increased incentives.
Financing
2017-18: Monetary policy remains cautious amid concern about a possible deterioration in credit quality. Political pressure on c0mmercial banks to reduce interest rates. Renewed pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey cannot be ruled out.
2019-21: The banking system remains stable, despite some weaknesses. Heavy reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2017-18: Labour market remains rigid, with relatively high costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment. Wage moderation after 30% minimum wage rise in 2016. Obstacles to employing foreigners ease.
2019-21: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Progress, albeit slow, continues on investment plans in energy, transport and communications.
2019-21: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. The construction of major airport and urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks could persist.

Our assessment of the macroeconomic environment focuses not on headline GDP growth (which is measured in the market opportunities category) but on economic stability, which aids business planning and promotes investment. We expect past improvements in Turkey's macroeconomic environment to be maintained in the forecast period. Since coming to power in 2002 the government has established a record of sound fiscal management. Although public borrowing has risen to support economic activity since the failed coup, we expect the government, mindful of the role that fiscal indiscipline played in past crises in Turkey, to return to a relatively tight fiscal policy in the near term, as it did after an expansionary phase during the global financial crisis in 2008-09. We also expect that the financial system will remain solid following the restructuring and improved supervision following Turkey's crisis in 2001, even though some of the macroprudential measures introduced by the Central Bank of Turkey and banking regulator since late 2013 have been unwound in 2017 to allow banks to expand lending.
As a large importer of energy and other raw materials, with perennially wide current-account deficits and substantial external-debt repayments (especially by the private sector), Turkey continues to rely heavily on external financing. For this reason, changes in global financial conditions or investor sentiment could cause high levels of volatility in Turkish exchange rates and market interest rates, with a significant impact on conditions for the domestic financial and productive sectors.
Volatile domestic demand, reliance on indirect taxation, limited price competition in some sectors-particularly agriculture-and the sensitivity of prices to exchange-rate and commodity-price movements have made it difficult to reduce consumer price inflation to low single-digit figures. We anticipate only a gradual reduction in the volatility and average level of price increases during the forecast period.

Turkey's scores poorly in this category. The state retains a significant role in many sectors, there is widespread political patronage, the legal system is politicised and corruption is rife. Private property is generally well protected and private enterprise is encouraged, but the use of emergency powers introduced in response to the failed coup, to seize or close firms suspected of having links to the Gulenist movement has created uncertainty. The value of seized assets amounts to about US$11bn in sectors including healthcare, education, construction, furniture, retail, energy and other sectors.
The seizure of firms since the failed coup has created uncertainty
The government supports private-sector investment and employment with incentives such as tax breaks and social security and credit subsidies, with an emphasis on underdeveloped regions, technology, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), production of currently imported intermediary goods and "strategic" sectors, such as defence, aerospace, automotive and pharmaceuticals. State lending programmes for small businesses have expanded since the failed coup as the Treasury has expanded its guarantees for banks, allowing them to lend to riskier customers. The government's desire for easier business lending is also evident in plans that have been floated to allow banks to securitise their existing loan portfolios.
Despite frequent legal challenges, privatisation is well advanced in numerous sectors, which include refining, petroleum products, parts of the energy sector, steel, mobile telecommunications, and tobacco and alcoholic drinks. The sale of power-distribution networks has been completed and the government aims to continue divesting some generation assets. However, the pace of privatisation has slowed amid market volatility in 2014-17.
Free competition is the norm in most sectors, and the Competition Board has power over mergers and acquisitions (M&A), price-fixing and abuse of market position. Like most other regulatory agencies, however, the Competition Board has limited independence, sharing competencies with government ministries. The public sector still plays the leading role in gas and water, rail transport, tea and sugar production, infrastructure and social services, such as healthcare, and education. The state has a significant position in banking (about 30% of total assets), mining, the defence industry, postal services and legal gambling, and retains large stakes in Turk Telekom (30%) and Turkish Airlines (49%). State dominance of natural-gas imports means that it controls a major input cost for the economy. There is a state-owned broadcaster (TRT), a state-owned home-builder (TOKI) and a state-owned oil and gas exploration company (TPAO). There are also sectors in which one or more private firms, including privatised companies, hold strong market positions.
Price controls operate for various reasons in electricity, gas, petroleum, telecoms and pharmaceuticals, and are expected to be introduced for bank charges. Competition is also inhibited by the large shadow economy, smuggling of petroleum products, cigarettes and many other items, and violation of intellectual property (IP) rights in many sectors, from software to fashion.
State assets transferred to the Turkey Wealth Fund unlikely to be privatised
Political and financial uncertainty may delay planned sales of state assets. Depending on market conditions, most of the following could be privatised by the end of the forecast period: operating rights for more ports, the national lottery and horse racing concession, shares in toll roads and bridges, TOKI, Vakifbank, more power plants, municipal companies in Istanbul, and some state-owned land. Control of the three main state banks-Halkbank, Ziraat and Vakif banks looks set to remain in government hands, and Ziraat and Vakif banks have recently launched an Islamic finance branch. The state banks may sometimes be used as a source of patronage.
The establishment in August 2016 of the Turkey Wealth Fund has removed some government assets from control of the privatisation agency. The wealth fund is designed to help finance large public works by using its assets as collateral, making sales of the assets under its control less likely. The fund now includes assets such as the state stake in Turkish Airlines, Halkbank and Turk Telekom, as well as Ziraat Bank, the Borsa Istanbul, and pipeline operator Botas.
Build-operate-transfer (BOT) or public-private partnership (PPP) schemes will increase the role of the private sector in the management of airports, water and irrigation facilities and hospitals. The railways are being restructured and the rail network separated from train services, but the state will still play a dominant role.
Despite public ownership of major assets, a more liberalised energy sector will emerge as a result of privatisation, new investments, the Electricity Market Law of March 2013 and changes in regulations that will widen consumer choice over power providers. A new wholesale trading platform is being established, aimed at setting a reliable market price for electricity and, in time, perhaps for gas and coal. Gas market reform has lagged behind electricity, but a new gas market law has been drafted and could be approved in the forecast period although the presence of Botas in the portfolio of the Wealth Fund may complicate plans to unbundle its assets.
Additional legislation on IP rights has been pending at parliament since 2016. The changes would replace a patchwork of decrees on the subject and strengthen IP rights in harmony with EU practices. Turkish, as well as foreign, companies are increasingly sensitive on this issue, so there is also likely to be progress in enforcement.
Political patronage and exclusive business networks will continue to play a significant role in business life. Companies close to government circles may be boldest in entering public tenders or operating in sectors where major decisions are taken by politicians, regulators or bureaucrats. Industrial policy may facilitate favouritism or uncompetitive arrangements. Some companies may face higher bureaucratic obstacles or tougher tax inspections than others.

Foreign direct investment will continue to be welcomed in most cases
Turkey's politicised judicial system and its poor record on corruption remain major deterrents for potential foreign investors. As a result, FDI inflows have been modest compared with most central and east European countries. Nevertheless, the government and most sections of society regard FDI in a positive light, and high levels of foreign ownership in industry and services are widely accepted. Turkey's heavy dependency on foreign-capital inflows gives the government additional incentives to attract FDI. Foreign-ownership restrictions are limited to a few areas, including broadcasting and civil aviation. The courts and sections of the public are occasionally hostile towards foreign investors when environmental issues or natural resources are at stake. A law passed in 2012 has boosted sales of property to foreigners by easing restrictions and waiving the condition of reciprocity for most countries. Foreign home owners are now given 12-month renewable residence permits. The new Turkish Commercial Code passed in 2012 clarified the rights of local agents, representatives or franchisees to compensation if their contracts are terminated.
Privatisation in energy and other sectors may provide opportunities for foreign investors, often in conjunction with local partners. The government will especially promote FDI in greenfield and expansion projects that can further its industrial policy goals, including import substitution and technological innovation.
In principle, foreign investors will continue to have the same access to government incentives as do domestic investors. Plans to improve the general investment environment by cutting red tape and streamlining the legal system will benefit foreign as well as domestic businesses. Restrictions on repatriation of profits are highly unlikely, even at times of financial market stress.

Turkey will remain committed to a broadly open trading regime. Under the 1996 customs union with the EU, it has customs-free trade in manufactured goods with EU member states and has adopted the EU common customs tariff, but has refused to grant Greek Cypriot ships and planes access to Turkish ports and airports unless the EU facilitates direct trade between the EU and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), which is not recognised internationally except by Turkey. Turkey's import regime reflects the EU's free-trade agreements (FTAs). It has bilateral FTAs with the European Free-Trade Association (EFTA), almost all EU partners in south-east Europe and the Mediterranean, as well as with Georgia, Chile, South Korea and Mauritius. Turkey is negotiating or pursuing FTAs with many other economies, especially countries such as Mexico, which have FTAs with the EU that give them an advantage in bilateral trade with Turkey, as well as reducing Turkey's privileges as a customs union partner. It has started initiatives aimed at negotiations with 10 other countries or blocs, including Canada and India. The Turkish lira has been fully convertible since 1989, and capital-account controls have never been considered since, regardless of exchange-rate swings and financial market volatility.
In the absence of a Cyprus settlement, Turkey is likely to resist EU pressure to open ports and airports to Greek Cypriot ships and planes. Similarly, without progress in its EU accession negotiations, Turkey is unlikely to lift restrictions on EU meat and used-car imports, eliminate discriminatory taxes on alcoholic drinks and tobacco products, or open up trade in services.
Domestic policy instability may delay renegotiation of customs union with EU
Turkey and the EU have agreed to revisit the current customs union agreement with a view to expanding it to potentially cover agricultural goods, services and public procurement, but talks have not yet started. Some EU politicians suggest that talks should be linked to political criteria. The proposed EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)-effectively an enhanced FTA-would have had a significant impact on Turkey's trade policies but political and public opposition in the EU and the US means that it is off the agenda for the foreseeable future.
The government is highly unlikely to impose capital controls. It is also unlikely to resort to outright protectionism, despite its efforts to encourage domestic production of items currently imported in large quantities. However, short-term protective measures will continue to be employed to limit imports of textiles, petrochemicals and other items from lower-cost countries. Concerned by high food price inflation, the country has established a Food Committee to examine and possibly revise the system of tariffs on agricultural products. This may lead to a relaxation of restrictions on agricultural imports.

As a percentage of GDP, tax revenue is low by OECD standards owing to high levels of evasion. According to government plans, tax revenue, including social security contributions, will be about 33% of GDP in 2017, compared with an OECD average of about 35% (2015 data). The corporation tax rate is 20%. Personal income tax rates range from 15% to 35%. The tax-free allowance for wage and salary earners varies from the equivalent of 50-90% of the minimum wage, according to the number of their dependants. Withholding taxes are widely used, but about 70% of tax revenue comes from indirect taxes, including value-added tax (VAT), which is levied at a standard rate of 18% (with lower rates of 8% and 1% for some items), and special consumption taxes on some goods and services, such as petroleum, alcohol, tobacco products, motor vehicles, telecoms services and banking transactions.
Obligatory social security contributions normally consist of 20.5% of gross salary, up to a certain limit, from the employer, 14% from the employee and a combined total of 3% to the Unemployment Insurance Fund, from both parties. Tax breaks, social security premium reductions and incentives are available to encourage investment in underdeveloped regions, important sectors and technological innovation, as well as to support employment. The tax administration can be unpredictable and disputes are common.
Frequent changes in tax regulation and evasion are likely to persist
Frequent changes in tax regulation are likely to persist, as will widespread tax and social security evasion, which is encouraged by frequent amnesties and opportunities to restructure arrears. The latest example was announced after the failed coup. Plans to simplify the tax system have been on the government agenda for some time, but as of August 2017 draft proposals had not been adopted.
Foreign companies will continue to be treated in the same way as Turkish companies. Turkey is expected to expand the already substantial number of double taxation agreements that it has during the forecast period.

Banking is well regulated, well capitalised and profitable. Non-performing loans (NPLs) as a share of total credit are low but have edged up since late 2015, although to only just above 3% in May 2017. The recent expansion of lending to small companies may have helped keep this figure low. The three main state-controlled banks-which operate largely on a commercial basis-and the four largest private banks controlled 74% of total assets at end-2016. The remainder is shared among another 45 institutions, including five Sharia-compliant "participation banks" and non-deposit-collecting investment banks. Government intervention in the sector is rare, but in February 2015 regulators took control of Bank Asya, an Islamic bank linked to the Gulenist movement. It was closed in the wake of the coup.
The banking system is solid, but curbs on credit growth have been relaxed
Bank lending growth has recorded periodic surges since 2010, driven by falling government borrowing needs and strong domestic and global liquidity. By mid-2016 the annual rate of credit growth to the non-financial sector had slowed to about 10%, from 45% in late 2011, with lending to businesses growing faster than lending to consumers. Following an easing of some reserve requirement ratios by the Central Bank of Turkey to halt the slowdown, credit growth accelerated to about 20% in the first half of 2017.
Weaker companies may experience difficulty obtaining bank credit, but the strongest Turkish companies, like Turkish banks, have access to loans from foreign/offshore banks and to local and international bond markets. The pace of share offerings on the volatile Borsa Istanbul has slowed in recent years. Market capitalisation is low, at about 26% of GDP in 2016. About 63% of the free float is foreign-owned. Private equity funds have become a significant alternative source of finance.
There is growth potential in the financial sector, despite some interest- and exchange-rate volatility and a likely deterioration in credit quality. Low domestic savings will remain a constraint, but changes to the private pension system will help to increase the availability of finance with longer maturities. Tighter global liquidity could reduce credit to the private sector.
Changes in bank ownership may occur, particularly for smaller banks, without changing the overall structure of the sector. The current government's antipathy towards private bank owners and sympathy for consumers and credit customers will encourage tighter regulation of certain banking activities, such as credit-card issuance.

Several factors will continue to limit the attractiveness of the labour market in the forecast period. There is a large, young labour pool, but workforce participation is only about 52%, partly owing to traditions that discourage female employment. Despite a greater number of years of formal education, the average level of education and skills remains below average European standards, and mismatches between education and the needs of the labour market persist. Employment of foreigners is exceptional and obtaining work permits can be problematic, but some restrictions have been eased. Informal employment and subcontracting are common way of avoiding tax, as well as legal obligations and rigidities, creating unfair competition, undermining safety standards and hindering productivity gains. In formal employment, hours and conditions are generally regulated and inflexible. Part-time working has increased but remains relatively low, at about 12% of total employment.
In response to employers' complaints about high labour costs, the government has sought to lighten the burden of social security contributions, especially for underdeveloped regions and the employment of young people, women and people with disabilities. Following a 30% rise in 2016 the gross minimum wage is relatively high at TL1,778 (US$504) a month.
The change to severance pay may take several years to implement
Companies complain that the system of severance pay, under which employers are liable to pay substantial lump sums to employees who retire or are made redundant, is too generous, hindering formal hiring. The government plan is to establish a severance pay fund, to which employers will contribute, but attempts to win acceptance of the plans from unions have met with resistance. The change to severance pay may take some years to implement.
The government aims to make the labour market more flexible-for example, by permitting the establishment of private employment agencies to supply temporary staff-while improving access to unemployment benefits. We expect the use of flexible employment contracts in the formal sector to increase only slowly. Proposals to set the minimum wage by region to take account of productivity and cost-of-living differences are not likely to be politically acceptable.
Labour market activation and education policies will raise skills levels and workforce participation only gradually. Despite the government's commitment to reducing unregistered employment, it is likely to remain a significant issue throughout the forecast period.
Restrictions on union membership, strikes and lock-outs that are incompatible with international norms promoted by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the EU are unlikely to be lifted. Unions may be influential in a few sectors but are unlikely to become stronger or more militant.

Turkey's infrastructure is broadly adequate for doing business. Recent years have seen investment by national and local government and the private sector, leading to some visible improvements, ranging from rapid growth of domestic air travel to the gradual extension of the natural gas pipeline network to almost all provinces and the spread of broadband Internet access and mobile-phone services. As in most countries, the number of fixed-line subscriptions has declined steadily, but mobile-phone penetration has risen rapidly, reaching 95% in early 2017. Computer ownership is low, but an estimated 76% of households had access to the internet in 2016, up from below 20% a decade earlier.
Infrastructure shortcomings will persist in most cities including urban overcrowding, congestion, earthquake risk and strains on water supply and waste disposal systems and the energy network. Rural infrastructure should improve a little in most places. Major irrigation works, including those in the south-east, will proceed slowly.
Major infrastructure projects are under way, but shortcomings also persist
Improvements in transport infrastructure will be piecemeal, and as a whole it will continue to lag behind EU standards, especially given the long distances between cities. The Marmaray rail project, including a tunnel under the Bosphorus, opened in late 2013 along with sections of the Ankara-Eskisehir-Istanbul fast train project. Rapid rail services, which already exist between Ankara and Eskisehir and between Ankara and Konya, will be extended westwards, to Izmir, and eastwards, to Kayseri and Sivas, around the end of the forecast period. There are plans to extend the rail network to Batum and Tiflis in Georgia.
Following the completion of the Ankara-Istanbul motorway in 2007, a connecting motorway link to Izmir is being built, incorporating a bridge over the Gulf of Izmit that opened in 2016. A third Bosphorus road bridge and related stretches of motorway in the north of Istanbul also opened in 2016. A Eurasia road tunnel is planned under the Bosphorus in the heart of Istanbul. These projects are being carried out on BOT terms.
Public and private investment will ensure that seaport capacity expands, despite bottlenecks and incomplete privatisation of management rights at some state-owned ports. A third Istanbul airport, tendered in May 2013 on a BOT basis, could start operating in 2018. During the forecast period there may be some progress on the "Istanbul channel" Bosphorus bypass ship-canal project.
Assuming moderate economic growth and improved energy efficiency, energy sector privatisation and market liberalisation will continue. Legislation facilitating the privatisation of lignite reserves is being implemented. Private investment (coupled with limited public investment) may be enough to increase power-generation capacity, cut transmission and distribution losses and prevent blackouts. Policies favouring energy generation from local and renewable sources will help to reduce gradually reliance on imported fuels.
We expect legislation to encourage private-sector oil and gas exploration to lead to an intensification of offshore activity in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean to intensify. The government has begun to explore the possibility of exploiting shale gas potential in the south-east and other parts of Turkey. Plans to construct two nuclear plants are highly controversial and, even if built, they will not come on stream until the early 2020s.
Intense competition in the mobile telecoms sector should ensure that infrastructure remains adequate and up-to-date, although there may be delays in adopting the latest technology or it may initially be expensive or concentrated in major cities. Fixed-line broadband Internet access has expanded rapidly, but at an estimated 12.7% in 2016 the penetration rate was still well below an average of 30-40% for most other European countries. Including large and rapidly rising numbers of mobile broadband subscriptions, the penetration rate is much higher. About 80% of all mobile subscriptions are now third-generation (3G), and fourth-generation (4G) technology began to be offered in 2016.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
Turkey's economy has shown resilience during past bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing largely to the country's solid public finances, its well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector and its dynamic, diver-sified private business sector. However, the risk of an intensification of political instability and fluctuations in global liquidity could disrupt foreign capital inflows to Turkey during the forecast period. These inflows are needed to meet the country's large external financing requirements, but tend to be short term and highly volatile. Faltering capital inflows put the lira under intense pressure in late 2016 and early 2017, fuelling an acceleration in inflation that prompted the Central Bank of Turkey to start tightening monetary policy in November 2016 after a prolonged period of loosening. The lira has stabilised since January 2017, but it remains vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment, as illustrated by a short, sharp drop in value against the US dollar in the first week of July, probably prompted by expectations of balance-sheet tapering by the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank). If the lira depreciates sharply again, an abrupt tightening of policy might be necessary, which could strangle Turkey's economic recovery. However, this is not The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline scenario, as we currently expect US monetary policy to be tightened only gradually in the remainder of 2017-18.
Uncertainty about the direction of Turkey's economic policy continues to cloud the country's medium-term economic outlook. The government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges have blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. The current direction of policy appears to be towards a difficult balancing act between fiscal loosening and tight monetary policy while encouraging banks to lend to households and businesses.

Budget balance -1.1 -2.0 -2.3 -2.2 -1.9 -1.7
Government debt 29.4 29.6 29.7 30.0 29.7 29.1

Low budget deficit- and public debt-to-GDP ratios-reflecting the impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past and major upward revisions to Turkey's national accounts-give the government some leeway to loosen fiscal policy to support the economy. Our baseline forecast remains that fiscal policy will be kept relatively tight to support investor confidence and prevent a surge in domestic demand from causing an unsustainable widening of the current-account deficit. Nevertheless, we expect the central government deficit, which captures most of the public sector, to widen from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to an average of 2.2% of GDP per year in 2017-19, before narrowing to 1.7% in 2021. Although the government debt/GDP ratio has edged up slightly, to 29.4% in 2016, we expect it to remain around 30% in 2017-21. The risk of a larger deterioration in the public finances cannot be ruled out. The transfer of Turkey's major state assets to a sovereign wealth fund established in 2016 to help finance major infrastructure projects could bring privatisation to a halt, and the fund could become a vehicle to increase off-budget spending.

Deposit rate (av) 11.2 12.0 11.5 11.0 10.0 9.0
Political pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey to lower interest rates to revive economic activity has eased as the government has switched its attention to Turkey's profitable commercial banks. We expect that the central bank will have to keep its monetary policy tight in the remainder of 2017 and in 2018 in order to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent a further depreciation of the lira amid expectations of higher US interest rates and Fed balance-sheet tapering. To do this, we expect the Turkish central bank to use a mix of interest rate rises, macroprudential measures and other policies. The bank raised most of its main policy rates between November 2016 and April 2017, and has increasingly provided funding to the banking sector at its previously little used "late liquidity window" overnight lending rate, which was gradually raised by a total of 250 basis points, to 12.25%, in late April. In mid-August 2017 the weighted average cost of the central bank's funds to the banking system was about 12%, compared with 7.8% in November 2016.
The central bank is seeking to normalise gradually its monetary policy frame-work to establish a single policy interest rate, which would help to improve transparency regarding monetary policy decisions. However, it is unlikely that this will happen until inflation is more firmly on a downward path towards its medium-term target of 5% and domestic political uncertainty eases.

Real GDP growth slowed from an annual average of 7.4% in 2010-15 to 3% in 2016, in part owing to the disruption to the economy from the failed coup last July but also faltering foreign capital inflows amid expectations of global liquidity tightening. A recovery got under way in the final quarter of last year, and we expect growth to accelerate to 4.5% in 2017 and an average of 4.1% in 2018-21. The rebound has been supported by government stimulus measures, political pressure on banks to extend credit and a pick-up in global demand. There are downside risks to this forecast, which is predicated on the assumption that the transition to a presidential system of government in the next few years does not lead to further political instability deterring foreign capital flows into the Turkish economy.
We expect a moderate improvement in confidence, a gradual recovery in employ-ment growth and government incentives for the purchase of certain household durable goods (in the short term, at least until September 2017) to support household spending. As a result, we forecast an acceleration in real private consumption growth, from 2.3% in 2016 to an annual average of 3.5% in 2017-21.
After expanding by 7.6% in 2016 we expect government spending to increase by nearly 8% per year on average in 2017-19 as the government seeks to revive the economy and boost support ahead of the 2019 elections. From 2020 we expect growth to be more moderate but still solid.
The deterioration in the business environment since the attempted coup will continue to hold down fixed investment growth at about 3% per year in 2017-18, as a more cautious approach by businesses will offset government plans to invest heavily in infrastructure projects. In 2019-21 we forecast an acceleration to average annual growth of 5%, assuming that domestic political tensions ease after the elections.
We expect the lifting of Russian sanctions on Turkey since mid-2016, the positive impact of a weaker lira on export competitiveness and stronger growth in the main export markets, especially in Europe, to drive a return to growth of exports of goods and services in 2017-21. However, we expect the perception of security risks to persist for some time, which will continue to deter some visitors to Turkey and weigh on the tourism sector. Our expectation is that a slowdown in the Chinese economy in 2018 and a cyclical downturn in the US in 2020 will dampen external demand growth in those years.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
As in most developing countries, the share of agriculture in nominal GDP has declined steadily in Turkey in recent decades. But at 6.9% of gross value added in 2016 agriculture remains an important sector, especially considering the input that it makes to Turkey's food, beverages and tobacco manufacturing industry. In addition, agriculture still accounts for a substantial share of about 20% of total employment, although almost half of those employed in the sector are classified as unpaid family workers. We expect the share of output of the primary sector to shrink slightly during the forecast period, but it will remain large compared with most other European countries at just over 6% of GDP in 2021. In 2016 the sector was hit by Russian sanctions on agricultural imports from Turkey, but most have now been lifted following the rapprochement between the two countries in June 2016. The sector would benefit from investment in irrigation in the south-east of the country and in some other regions, but investment is likely to remain on hold in areas affected by the conflict with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The importance of modern, large-scale agricultural enterprises will gradually spread, but the problems of traditional agriculture and unclear policymaking are likely to persist.
Manufacturing will continue to play a central role in the Turkish economy
Industry, including manufacturing, mining and construction, accounted for 32% of GDP in 2016. The collapse in investment and export demand during the 2008-09 global crisis hit the manufacturing and construction sectors hardest. Since then manufacturing and particularly construction have rebounded. In 2016 manufacturing accounted for about 22% of GDP, compared with about 25% at the end of the 1990s. Having fallen as low as 6.3% of GDP in 2009, the construction sector accounted for a very high 10% in 2016.
Construction has been a significant driver of economic growth in recent years. Following annual real growth of 8-9% in the first two quarters of 2016, however, activity has slowed gradually to growth of 4.6% in the first quarter of 2017 amid concern about a possible property market crash. The pace of housing construc-tion-which accounts for around 75% of total activity in volume terms-had outstripped demand for several years, even after allowing for strong demographically driven growth in the number of households and accelerated replacement of existing buildings. The slowdown is likely to continue in the remainder of 2017, given oversupply, weak household and business sentiment, and uncertain financial conditions.
Although several manufacturing subsectors, such as automotive, and textiles and clothing, are strongly export-oriented and will continue to generate trade surpluses, Turkey's manufactured exports are generally import intensive; that is, a large portion of the inputs, whether energy, intermediates or capital goods, are imported, adding to Turkey's external imbalances, especially when international commodity prices are high or the lira weak, as it has been since mid-2013. This situation is unlikely to change much during the forecast period, as reducing the import intensity of exports and moving up the value-added chain will take time, even though these were explicit goals in the government's investment-incentive system, introduced in 2012.
Vehicle production will fluctuate in line with demand in Europe
Before the global crisis, the automotive industry, which is closely integrated with the European market, overtook clothing as Turkey's biggest export industry. However, as elsewhere, the industry was one of the worst hit by the credit squeeze. Turkish automotive output and export earnings have recovered since the crisis. In 2016 Turkish vehicle production reached just over 1.5m vehicles, making Turkey the fifth-largest producer in Europe and the 15th-largest in the world. About 70% of vehicles produced in Turkey are for export and the bulk of these go to the EU. As a result, vehicle production will fluctuate in line with demand in Europe. Demand in Europe has picked up since mid-2013, probably reflecting the release of pent-up demand after several years of weakness. Over the forecast period as a whole, however, deleveraging in many markets and potential disruption to demand as a result of the UK's decision to leave the EU are likely to hold down growth in demand for new vehicles and therefore Turkish exports. Given the growth potential of the automotive market in Turkey and the wider region, manufacturers with production plants in Turkey may start to focus more on the Turkish, Middle Eastern and North African markets. At present, about 60% of all new vehicles sold, and just over 70% of new passenger-car registrations, are imported.
We believe that most manufacturers will maintain their production facilities in Turkey. These facilities are technologically advanced and labour costs are much lower in Turkey than in core European countries, and are probably below those in most central and east European countries, where wages have risen strongly following accession to the EU. However, if Turkey is to remain a major automotive production location in the medium to long term, manufacturers will have to move away from exporting low-end passenger cars, light commercial vehicles (LCVs) and components to north European markets, towards developing and producing alternative energy engines and vehicles. There are some signs that this transition is happening. Toyota began producing hybrid passenger cars in Turkey at the end of 2016.
Textiles and clothing industries are likely to shrink further
The basic textiles industry is likely to shrink further over the forecast period, but clothing will remain an important export industry. The industry has undergone restructuring under the intense pressure of competition from low-cost pro-ducers in Asia. The government has also been looking at ways to improve investment incentives and target higher value-added products.
Turkish consumer electronics companies will continue to be major exporters
Production of industrial machinery and of white goods and other household durables, including furniture, recovered strongly as a result of a pick-up in domestic demand and export opportunities in 2010-11. However, more moderate domestic and external demand dampened growth in output in 2012-15. We expect Turkish consumer electronics companies to continue to be major exporters, although they appear to have been slow to adopt technological innovations in some segments.
Investment in the iron and steel industries, which accounted for a declining share of the value of total exports-8.9% in 2016, down from 9.5% in 2015 and 11.5% in 2013-may result in the medium term in greater output of flat products and other items with higher value added. However, in the short term, the value of exports will be largely driven by global metals prices, which fell for a fifth consecutive year in 2016. We expect solid price growth in 2017 driven by recovering demand across emerging markets, but a contraction again in 2018, as weaker demand from China offsets demand growth elsewhere.
If security concerns diminish, growth potential in tourism is good
Tourism, one of the most important services sectors of the Turkish economy, has witnessed rapid growth in the past ten years, but it remains vulnerable to geopolitical developments and changes in the exchange rate. Having reached a new record of 37m in 2014, the number of foreign visitors (excluding Turkish citizens living abroad) dipped slightly in 2015, reflecting mainly the impact of EU/US trade sanctions on the Russian economy (visitors from Russia, Turkey's second largest tourist market, fell by 18.5%) and perceived security concerns following a spate of terrorist attacks in the second half of the year. Balance-of-payments data show that travel receipts from all visitors, including Turkish citizens living abroad, fell from US$29.6bn in 2014 to US$26.6bn. In 2016 tourism was hit hard by Russian sanctions, which have now been lifted, and by terrorist attacks. Ministry of Culture and Tourism figures put the total number of foreign visitor arrivals in 2016 at 25.4m, a year-on-year fall of 30%. In the first half of 2017 visitors from Russia rose to 1.7m, from just 184,000 in January-June 2016, exceeding the level in 2015, but visitors from west and central European countries fell by 12.8% year on year, to 4.8m, suggesting security concerns may still be deterring visitors from key markets such as Germany and the UK. If security concerns diminish, growth potential is good. Foreign interest in residential real estate and hotels has been strong, and the sector remains price-competitive compared with those of many other Mediterranean destinations, especially after the weakening of the lira against the euro, which is the currency of Turkey's main tourist markets and of competitors such as Greece, Cyprus and Malta.

Consumer price inflation has remained stubbornly high-well above the official 5% medium-term target-as a weaker lira has, for the most part, offset the disin-flationary effects of low global oil prices. We expect further currency weakness and a moderate recovery in oil and other commodity prices from 2017 to keep consumer price inflation well above the official target during the first half of the forecast period. Assuming that the central bank does not loosen monetary policy too soon, we expect inflation to ease gradually, achieving the 5% target by end-2021.

The lira will also depreciate sharply against the euro in 2017-21. There are substantial risks to our exchange-rate forecast, arising from uncertainty about the outlook for global financial flows as well as the impact on investor confidence of domestic political tensions and geopolitical turmoil in the region surrounding Turkey.

We expect the current account to widen moderately and to remain sufficiently large-at a forecast average of 4.2% of GDP per year in 2017-21-making it difficult for Turkey to meet its external financing needs if global liquidity is constrained and investor confidence deteriorates. Although a weaker lira and the lifting of Russian sanctions will boost Turkey's main export sectors, we expect this to be largely offset by the moderately higher cost of imported energy and inputs for manufactured import-intensive exports. There has been a rebound in Russian tourist arrivals in 2017, but the tourism sector is likely to take several years to recover to its 2015 pre-crisis levels, before the resurgence of terrorist attacks and the imposition of Russian sanctions.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Turkey
Stocks and flows
Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows rose dramatically in 2005-08, after averaging a modest 1% of GDP between 1990 and 2004. In the context of the global economic and financial crisis, they slowed again in 2009-10 and have remained below the level reached in 2006-08 of around US$20bn. According to balance-of-payments statistics, inflows of FDI, including sales of real estate to non-residents, declined to around US$13bn, or 1.4% of GDP, per year in 2012-14, before picking up to US$17.6bn, or 2% of GDP, in 2015. In 2016 FDI inflows fell back to US$12.3bn, or 1.4% of GDP. With FDI inflows amounting to just US$4.9 in the first half of 2017, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the full-year figure to be slightly below that in 2016. The stock of inward FDI stood at just 15.6% of GDP in 2016. This figure compares with 60% in Slovakia, 70% in the Czech Republic, and 48% in Poland. Following a fall from US$4.1bn in 2012 to US$3.6bn in 2013, Turkish outward FDI jumped to US$7bn in 2014, largely reflecting a small number of large transactions, notably the acquisition of the UK-based United Biscuits by Yildiz Holding. The figure eased to US$5.1bn in 2015, still a relatively large figure by historical standards, and to US$3.1bn in 2016.
Origin and distribution
The traditional sources of foreign capital in Turkey have been multinational companies based in major EU countries, especially the Netherlands, Germany, the UK and France, and in other OECD countries such as the US, Switzerland and Japan. Individual large investments from several smaller EU countries, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Brazil have amended this pattern in recent years, and there have also been some significant purchases by private equity funds. About 90% of foreign investment appears to go to Istanbul, where most national Turkish companies have their headquarters. Investment projects of foreign capital companies are overwhelmingly concentrated in the Marmara region (which includes Istanbul), the Aegean region, the Mediterranean and Ankara. Historically, manufacturing (particularly the chemicals, food and automotive industries) and financial services attracted the most FDI. In 2012 construction figured prominently, with about 13% of net FDI inflows, although this was the result of the inclusion in this category of a single investment by the French-based Aéroports de Paris, which bought a 38% stake in Turkey's airport operator, TAV Airports, and a 49% stake in its construction arm, TAV Construction. In 2015 the share of FDI of financial services rose sharply to 30% of the total, from about 17% in the previous year; this again reflected the impact of a single large investment in which a Spanish bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), increased its stake in Garanti Bank. Chemicals and pharmaceuticals was the second largest category in 2015, accounting for 15% of total FDI inflows. Problems in developed economies, and the euro zone crisis in particular, together with the more recent deterioration in economic prospects in Turkey, has led to divestments by foreign financial institutions, many of which entered the Turkish market in 2005-08. As part of a plan to shore up its capital base, the National Bank of Greece has sold its 99.8% stake in Finans Bank, but because the sale, which was completed in mid-2016, was to Qatar National Bank, it did not affect net inward FDI figures in 2016.
Foreign property purchases, which are included in balance-of-payments statistics for FDI, have been making a solid contribution to net inflows since 2005. In 2005-13 net inflows averaged a solid US$2.5bn per year, before picking up to US$4.3bn in 2014, US$4.2bn in 2015 and US$3.9bn in 2016. In the first half of 2017 net investment in real estate rose by 34.3% year on year, to US$2.4bn.
Determinants
Foreign investment is mostly motivated by the size and potential of the Turkish market, but also increasingly because it offers access to neighbouring markets. The sharp rise in FDI in 2005-07 was partly driven by favourable global financial conditions, which have since evaporated. However, the upsurge was also made possible by the conjunction of several country-specific factors. The 2001 financial crisis led to a new drive for reform and privatisation, and reforms in sectors such as energy, telecommunications and banking began to take hold. The Justice and Development Party (AKP), in power since 2002, was more willing than its predecessors to sell majority stakes in state-owned companies to foreigners, even in sectors previously considered "strategic". The economy was relatively stable and grew strongly, and EU accession talks, which were expected to lead to further reform of the business environment, got under way. The private sector was also more willing to seek foreign partners than in the past. This may have reflected the thinking of a new generation of management, strategies of specialisation in certain sectors, a desire to raise capital for privatisation bids, fear of increasing foreign competition, lost appetite for bank ownership and temptingly high company valuations. From 2008, although the government remained willing to privatise, market conditions deteriorated, resulting in less interest from foreign investors. Since 2013 potential deterrents have multiplied: less buoyant economic growth, mass anti-government protests, financial market volatility, government corruption allegations, the spillover of violence from the conflict in Syria and, most recently, the collapse of the peace negotiations with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and an attempted military coup in July 2016. Other significant structural deterrents, which vary by the sector, size and type of investment, include regulatory uncertainty, a slow and unpredictable judicial system, weak intellectual property (IP) protection and unfair competition from smuggled goods and the informal sector.
Impact
The FDI stock as a percentage of GDP is much lower than in most central and east European countries, Turkey's main competitors for FDI. However, FDI has accumulated over many decades and the outlook compared with several central and eastern European countries has improved. Several leading multinationals, such as Unilever and Ford, have had a long-standing presence in Turkey, and companies with foreign partners play a significant role in the economy, helping to spread modern management and business practice. In the automotive industry, foreign investment has ensured expansion, technology transfer and access to global markets, although some lament the lack of national technology or a national trademark and the focus on production of low-end vehicles. By contrast, much recent FDI has taken the form of acquisitions of existing assets in domestically oriented sectors, and has therefore had limited direct impact on fixed investment or exports. Foreign ownership of banks has not demonstrably improved either access to international funds or services and productivity, which were already advanced, and nor have fears been fulfilled that foreign-owned banks may attach a greater risk premium than local banks to lending to the Turkish government or Turkish companies. The arrival of Vodafone has gradually helped to increase competition and investment in telecoms, where Turkcell and Turk Telekom are dominant players. From a macroeconomic perspective, Turkey relies on capital inflows, including FDI, to cover its large external financing requirement. In the years prior to the 2008-09 crisis, a growing share of FDI in capital inflows comforted the financial markets by reducing the vulnerability of the lira to trends in short-term capital inflows. However, the low level of FDI inflows relative to Turkey's current-account deficit continues to raise concerns about the sustainability of its external financing needs. We expect the ratio to improve during the forecast period, rising to about 35-40% of the projected current-account deficit, although most of this improvement reflects the impact of low international oil prices on the current-account deficit.
Potential
Our baseline forecast is that, assuming security concerns will be addressed during the forecast period, there will be a moderate pick-up driven by further privatisation and other crossborder mergers and acquisitions, as well as foreign interest in residential and commercial property, following the easing of restrictions on foreign ownership of real estate in 2012. Although the surge in foreign acquisitions in telecoms and banking of 2006-07 is unrepeatable, private corporations in many sectors may still be open to foreign investment, and several major assets remain to be privatised. We assume that the government will make further progress in creating conditions for private-sector investment in infrastructure. The energy sector in particular has the potential to attract large amounts of foreign investment. Existing investors are likely to increase their investment through further acquisitions or projects, and some greenfield investment may take place. Subdued income growth may dampen foreign investors' earlier interest in retailing, but they may also become more active in other services, such as tourism, as well as in mining and agriculture. Accordingly, we expect FDI to average close to 2% of GDP a year in 2016-20. Investors from the Gulf region and Asia may play a larger role, in addition to Western multinationals and funds.

Overall spending power will rise, but income distribution will remain uneven
The large consumer market is one of Turkey's chief attractions as a place to do business. The population is young, growing and inclined to consume rather than save, and average incomes are rising steadily in local currency terms. In 2016 GDP per head was US$10,767 at market exchange rates and US$24,268 at purchasing power parity (PPP) rates. These figures are well below those for all central and east European countries in the EU, except Bulgaria and Romania. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Turkey's GDP per head to be about US$30,500 at PPP exchange rates in 2021. At this level, GDP per head in Turkey will be about 65% of the EU28 average, an increase of about 7 percentage points in ten years. This reflects not only Turkey's growth performance, but also the lasting impact of the current euro zone crisis on the EU average.
Income distribution is uneven by European standards. According to the official 2015 (latest available) survey of incomes and living conditions, members of the highest earning 20% of households accounted for 46.5% of total income, up from 45.9% in 2014, and the members of the lowest earning 20% of households for 6.1%, down from 6.2% in the previous year. Geographical factors contributed to the discrepancies. In general, the regions with the highest and most rapidly growing concentrations of population were also the wealthiest regions-except in the south-east, where spending power is low. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (Turkstat), greater Istanbul, which accounts for about one-fifth of the population, represents about one-quarter of household consumption expenditure. By contrast, the statistical region of south-east Anatolia, with about 10% of the population, generated about only 6% of household consumption. Income and consumer expenditure also vary widely between urban and rural areas, and within cities. These patterns are unlikely to change significantly in 2017-21.
Households are expected to decline in size
The household will remain the main consumption unit during the forecast period. Households typically consist of an average 3.4 people and over 90% of households are made up of married couples. Although these patterns will change only gradually, the number of households will tend to increase faster than the population, sustaining strong demand for housing construction and household durables, including basics like furniture, washing machines and refrigerators.
A large majority of Turkish consumers aspire to "western style" consumer society, in so far as their incomes permit, although local factors affect lifestyle aspirations. Much of the population adheres to Islamic prohibitions, including on consumption of alcohol. The country has wide variations in geography and climate, which affect diet, leisure activities and demand for certain goods. Choices of entertainment vary between groups with different education levels.

Young population will encourage new products and services to be introduced
The proportion of total household spending allocated to food, beverages and tobacco is high and not expected to fall much during the forecast period. Housing and household fuel, goods and services will also remain major expenditure items. The wealthiest households, which enjoy standards of living close to those of west Europeans, spend significant amounts on entertainment, education and catering, as well as on transport, because of the high cost of running a car. These households will remain an important target market for environment-friendly and wellness products and services, which are relatively new. Other population segments are starting to provide additional demand for items that have been the prerogative of upper income groups. Rising car ownership will continue to encourage supermarket shopping, residence in suburban areas and related lifestyle trends. Demand for branded fashion items, fast food, air conditioning and holidays is also spreading. That half of the population is under the age of 30 will encourage the introduction of new products and services in communications, information and entertainment tech-nology. Tourists constitute a significant addition to the consumer market. About 50m, including foreigners and non-resident Turks, visited Turkey in 2014 and 2015. This figure fell to a still sizeable 39m in 2016. Domestic political instability and security concerns are likely to dampen near-term growth, but growth potential in the sector is good.

Initial conditions: Some of the obstacles to solid and stable growth were removed in the decade to 2010, but in recent years the government has focused on domestic power struggles and the foreign-policy challenges arising from turmoil in the wider region, putting economic reforms designed to boost investment and employment on hold. Given the deterioration of Turkey's institutions of governance and the likelihood that the current domestic political tensions will continue for some time, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects only limited progress on reforms in the near term, damaging Turkey's longer-term growth potential. For similar reasons, we do not expect Turkey's EU membership bid to make significant progress, making accession a remote prospect. A relatively low level of skills and quality of the workforce compared with Turkey's main competitors for foreign direct investment (FDI) in central and eastern Europe will continue to act as a deterrent to FDI, although Turkey will enjoy substantially more favourable demographics. The quality of infrastructure is also likely to lag behind, especially in remote eastern areas of the country.
Working-age population growth turns negative in 2040
Demographic trends: On current projections, Turkey will have the second-largest national population in Europe, after Russia, by 2050; and unlike in most European economies Turkey's working-age population will continue to grow up to 2040. Nevertheless, Turkey's positive demographic dynamic is expected to start to deteriorate from about 2030. In 2031-50 the difference between growth in the population of working age and that of the total population will become negative, which will dampen economic growth. This trend could be delayed if the bulk of 3.1m Syrian refugees currently being hosted in Turkey are integrated into the population.
Throughout the long-term forecast period, we expect an upward trend in the labour force and employment because of rises in participation rates, given the low starting levels. With the workforce continuing to expand at a steady rate, it will be a challenge to produce sufficient jobs to keep the unemployment rate on a downward trend from a forecast 9.7% in 2021.
External conditions: Wider international developments-particularly in international financial markets, the EU (Turkey's main export market) and in global terms of trade-will continue to affect Turkey's long-term economic performance. With export-led industries playing an increasing role in growth, Turkey would benefit from greater global trade liberalisation, but the process of liberalisation is faltering and trade flows have slowed. As a supplier of the developed economies, Turkey will continue to face intense international competition, since low and medium value-added manufactured goods are likely to remain its main product lines. Its technology potential is relatively limited, and the country is not well placed to become a major supplier of services other than tourism and, to a lesser extent, construction, although improvements in (and diversification of) the domestic financial sector over the past decade may enable Turkey to develop as a provider of banking and insurance services in the wider region. Because of completed and planned pipeline construction, Turkey is expected to become a major energy hub between the Caspian region and western Europe. As Turkey shares borders with countries like Iran, Syria and Iraq, its immediate regional environment is challenging. We expect Turkey's foreign policy to remain broadly Western-oriented, although given recent developments in the domestic political sphere there is a considerable risk that under the current religiously conservative government Turkey's foreign relations will take a different path.
The EU's problems will dampen Turkey's interest in membership
We do not expect Turkey to join the EU and there is a high probability that the accession negotiations may even be abandoned by one or both sides during the long-term forecast period. Given the limited progress so far in Turkey's EU accession negotiations, the strength of public opposition in most EU member states to Turkish membership and the severity of the economic and political problems facing the EU, we believe that Turkey's commitment to the goal of full EU membership will diminish even further. This increases the risk that government commitment to political and economic reform will weaken further. Harmonisation of Turkey's domestic legislation with EU norms is significantly more important for Turkey's long-term economic stability than actual membership. If the EU were to loosen its structure-the UK's vote to leave the EU could prompt such a move-opposition in the EU to Turkish accession might ease, increasing Turkey's chances of joining.
Institutions and policy trends: Recep Tayyip Erdogan's victory in Turkey's first direct election of the president in August 2014 and the approval of his presidential reform plan in a referendum in April 2017 have potentially huge implications for the country's future institutional and policy-setting framework. The constitutional reform allows Mr Erdogan to run for president for two five-year terms, which means he is likely to be in power until 2029. Beyond that, assuming the constitution is not amended further to allow him to run for a third term, which cannot be ruled out, the issue of his succession as leader of the AKP and president of the country could become a source of instability during the long-term forecast period.
The broadly positive management of the economy by the AKP since coming to power in 2002 has been one of the main reasons for its electoral successes. But there is a considerable risk that economic policy will be increasingly tailored to political purposes rather than to maintain macroeconomic stability and further improvement of the business environment. Nevertheless, Turkey's public finances are structurally sounder following a decade of IMF-backed reforms in 1999-2008, which may allow the government more room to increase public investment in infrastructure and possibly to reduce tax rates further, if solid economic growth is sustained. Given the little progress that we expect to be made in Turkey's EU accession negotiations, the problems of unpredictability and inefficiency in Turkey's domestic legal and regulatory environment are expected to continue beyond 2021. Legislation is likely to remain under the scrutiny of the EU and other international bodies, such as the IMF, World Bank, the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights, although Mr Erdogan's assertive and increasingly personalised approach to foreign relations is likely to limit their influence over the direction of policies.
The government's peace negotiations with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed following the June 2015 election, and neither the PKK nor Mr Erdogan has shown any indication that they are willing to revive it any time soon. If the situation continues on its current trajectory, there is a real risk that the PKK and its affiliates will spread the conflict from the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited south-east of the country to Turkey's main cities in central and western regions, where the Kurdish population has risen rapidly in recent years. The mounting death toll will probably encourage Mr Erdogan to resort to increasingly authoritarian means to retain control.
Income levels will remain well below the EU average
Long-term performance: Turkey's economic growth performance is expected to surpass that of the EU28 as a result of its more favourable demographic profile and larger productivity increases. But, at an average of 3% a year in 2017-50, GDP growth will be well below the performance recorded in 2004-07 and 2010-15. Average growth in GDP per head will be substantially lower, reflecting the expected rise in the total population. Income levels will remain well below the EU28 average, but catch-up is likely to continue. Improvements in the policy environment could produce substantially better results, but there is still uncertainty about Turkey's future political and institutional framework, and its commitment to the reforms required under the EU accession process.

Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines ten separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, and infrastructure. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 16 (infrastructure), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2012-16) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2017-21). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2012-16. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2017-21 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
The main sources used in the business rankings model include CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce; Freedom House, Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties; Heritage Foundation, Index of Economic Freedom; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; UN, Human Development Report; US Social Security Administration, Social Security Programs Throughout the World; World Bank, World Development Report; World Development Indicators; Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Report.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2012-16 ranges are then used to derive 2017-21 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2017-21, not to the likely situation in 2021 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2014 or 2019). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Abstract: Thailand's score for financing will improve in 2017-21, as the banking sector will be in better health. [...]a deterioration in the financing environments of neighbouring countries will result in Thailand's regional ranking for the category rising by one place to sixth, although an improvement in countries outside the region will see its global ranking slip by one place to 22nd. [...]we expect the average retirement age in the private sector to increase in 2017-21, but this will do little to counter the problems posed by skills shortages on the overall labour market. The regulator expects the commercial launch of 5G bandwidth in 2020, although we believe that those auctions will be completed at a similarly slow pace. [...]the new bandwidth is likely to lag behind equivalent offerings in most other Asian countries in terms of speed, as with 4G, owing to shortfalls in service provider technology. 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Population (m) 68.9 69.0 69.2 69.3 69.4 69.5 GDP (US$ bn at market exchange rates) 407.2 436.8 445.4 449.7 477.3 501.9 GDP per head (US$ at market exchange rates) 5,913 6,327 6,437 6,488 6,876 7,222 GDP (US$ bn at PPP) 1,166 1,229 1,290 1,334 1,397 1,474 GDP per head (US$ at PPP) 16,926 17,807 18,639 19,245 20,127 21,208 Personal disposable income (US$ bn) 218.9 231.5 232.0 233.5 246.1 258.4 Median household income (US$) 8,030 8,042 8,473 8,531 8,601 8,929 Household consumption (US$ bn) 206.2 218.1 218.6 220.1 231.9 243.5 Household consumption per head (US$) 2,990 3,160 3,160 3,180 3,340 3,500 Exports of goods & services (% change) 2.1 3.7 2.2 2.1 4.0 4.3 Imports of goods & services (% change) -1.3 4.3 3.1 2.3 3.7 3.6 Thailand constitutes a sizeable market in its own right, with a population of 69m and nominal GDP equivalent to around US$407.2bn at market exchange rates in 2016. [...]the development of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free-Trade Area means that firms located in Thailand will continue to enjoy almost entirely duty-free access to ASEAN's population of 500m, including a burgeoning middle class with growing disposable incomes.

Full text: Thailand--highlights: Political outlook
The military-led government will remain in complete control until the next general election, which The Economist Intelligence Unit expects to be held in 2019. The new constitution (approved by the public in a referendum in 2016), which will be adopted under a newly elected government, will allow the military to maintain significant influence over executive and legislative affairs throughout the forecast period (2017-21). The junta will also continue to enforce lese-majesty laws strongly as it manages the funeral of the former monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and the formal accession of the new king, Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, in late 2017. The military's stronghold will ensure political stability in 2017-21, albeit at the expense of many civil liberties. However, organised, but non-violent, challenges to govern-ment cannot be ruled out, particularly later in the forecast period.

Population growth   0.4 0.2

Labour force growth   -0.3 0.2
The rate of population growth will slow in the forecast period as a result of effective family-planning programmes, sex education and changing social norms, such as later marriages and smaller families. Continuing improvement in the prevention and treatment of infectious disease will contribute to a rising life expectancy and a growing share of the population over 65 years old. However, owing to a shortage of formal job opportunities in neigh-bouring countries, migrant labour from Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos will continue to grow in absolute terms. In combination with an increase in the average retirement age, this will serve to boost the labour force in 2017-21.

Thailand's business environment score rises in 2017-21, helping to improve its global ranking to 34th, from 38th in 2012-16. Its regional position remains at ninth out of 17 countries. The macroeconomic environment will remain stable and the Bank of Thailand (the central bank) will maintain its independence. We expect modest improvements in policies towards private enterprise and competition and towards foreign investment. The overall tax regime will remain stable and accommodative to business. Trade liberalisation will continue, with growing integration among Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) members and other countries in Asia. Long-overdue construction on a number of transport infrastructure projects will also get under way.

We forecast that Thailand's real GDP will expand by 3.3% on average in 2017, but growth will average 3% a year in 2018-21 owing to tepid external demand. Public investment in infrastructure development will lend considerable support to growth in the early part of the forecast period. Private consumption will remain under pressure owing to high household debt and weak wage growth. Nonetheless, a clearer political path, following the referendum on the constitution in 2016 and the accession of the new king, will reassure investors, helping to boost growth in the later years of the forecast period. The tourism sector will remain a key support for the economy throughout 2017-21.

Household consumption per head (US$) 2,990 3,160 3,160 3,180 3,340 3,500
Thailand is a sizeable market in its own right, with a population of more than 69m and nominal GDP equivalent to US$407.2bn at market exchange rates in 2016. The retail sector will create market opportunities, in large part owing to the continuing strength of the tourism sector. Populist govern-ments in the early 2000s ensured strong growth in income levels through fiscal handouts, high minimum wages and price controls. Although the current and next government will try to be more fiscally prudent, they will have to maintain supportive policies for key interest groups in order to ensure political stability. Household debt will remain a dampener on consumer sentiment for much of the forecast period, but a tax regime increasingly focused on wealth, rather than income and consumption, will avoid crimping private consumption growth further.

The long-term outlook for Thailand's economy hinges heavily on the assumption that governments in the next ten years will possess greater political power than their predecessors to enact and continue structural reforms, as well as develop infrastructure. Such reforms will improve the business environment and raise productivity. However, there will be persistent delays, mainly owing to (partly self-imposed) financial constraints. Thailand's demographic profile will also start to have a significant, negative impact on GDP growth from the 2030s.

Background: Following a revolution in 1932, Thailand's absolute monarchy was replaced with a constitutional monarchy. Over the years, while the elected government gained prominence, democracy was turbulent and led to several coups (nearly 19 have been staged since 1932). The latest coup took place in May 2014, when the democratically elected government led by Yingluck Shinawatra was removed following months of protests and political turmoil. The Shinawatra family gained prominence in Thai politics in 2001 when Thaksin Shinawatra, a businessman-turned-politician and Yingluck's older brother, was elected prime minister. He remained in office until 2006, when he was removed by a coup. Thaksin was a populist leader and his political prominence created a divide between the rural population in the northern provinces and the urban rich of the south. This rift is a lasting consequence of Thai democracy and has emerged from income inequality between the rural and urban parts of the country. Although the junta remains firmly in control of government, a return to democracy is likely to give way to renewed rivalry between the two camps.
Political structure: The military officers who comprise the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO, the formal name for the junta), led by Prayuth Chan-ocha as prime minister, control an interim government made up of a 200-member National Legislative Assembly (parliament), a 35-member cabinet and a 250-member reform council. The members of these bodies were appointed by the NCPO and are mainly military officers. The king remains the symbolic head of state. Following the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in October 2016, the crown prince, Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, ascended the throne.
Policy issues: The military-led government will focus on improving the investment environment in Thailand and head a public-investment drive in infrastructure in an effort to boost the country's long-term economic performance. The junta's continuing grip on power will reassure many foreign investors deterred by potential instability, but growing regional competition will detract from Thailand's attractiveness as an investment destination.
Taxation: Corporate income tax stands at 20%. Tax concessions are available for firms that list on the stockmarket. Value-added tax (VAT) stands at 7%. Personal income tax rises to 35% on annual taxable earnings exceeding Bt5m (US$145,000).
Foreign trade: According to national-accounts data, Thailand recorded a merchandise trade surplus (fob-fob) of US$35.8bn in 2016, up from US$26.8bn in 2015. The current-account surplus stood at US$46.8bn in 2016, up from US$32.1bn in 2015.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
The military rules the country via a junta known as the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), led by the former army chief and current prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha. The military coup in May 2014 led to the dissolution of the House of Representatives (parliament) elected in 2011. The NCPO appointed an interim National Legislative Assembly in its place in August 2014, consisting mainly of security officers and civilians supportive of the military. A 250-member National Reform Council, which is tasked with recommending reforms and approving a new charter, was also appointed. A new constitution was approved in a public referendum in August 2016, paving the way for fresh elections but also sealing the considerable influence of the military on the next government. However, the NCPO's planned path back to elections has been delayed by the death in late 2016 and pending cremation in October 2017 of the previous king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, and the coronation of the new monarch, Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, that will follow. The accession process was not destabilising, partly owing to the military government's imperative to sustain the royal institution in order to legitimise its own political role. Nonetheless, the king's prominent place in Thai society will slowly diminish in coming years, as the new monarch fails to command the same level of reverence among the public that his father did.
Political outlook: Political stability
The NCPO will continue to control the legislature until elections are held, which The Economist Intelligence Unit expects to take place in 2019 at the earliest. The new constitution, approved in a public referendum in August 2016, cements the military's continued influence over government even after the next ballot. The accession of King Maha will have a minimal impact on political stability in the forecast period (2017-21); the formal coronation will take place after the cremation of his late father on October 25th.
The king's endorsement will remain important for the junta
The military establishment depends on endorsement by the king for much of its political legitimacy. It has therefore ensured the continuance of the monarchy in line with the wishes of the late king, who even in death will remain a figure of paramount reverence among the Thai public. King Maha has already sought to consolidate his position in the political sphere by tailoring rules concerning the delegation of the monarch's authority and control over the royal estate to his preference. Although some of these alterations indicate a slightly stronger foundational role in politics than in the previous charter, in practice royal intrusion into everyday politics will remain rare. The junta's dependence on the continuation of the monarchy in its traditional form has led to the proactive suppression of any criticism of the new king via lese-majesty laws. The wide-ranging enforcement of these laws will remain the norm until the king's coronation, in an attempt to minimise any reputational damage to the royal institution and its long-term role within the state.
The junta has also boosted oversight and censorship of mass media and public debate in an attempt to suppress dissent against the military government. For instance, the authorities have threatened to revoke the operating licences of some internet service providers unless they block certain pages on major social media and video-streaming platforms featuring politically sensitive content. This trend is likely to ensure political stability in the near term. However, a mounting clampdown on free speech and association risks aggravating public discontent with the current political situation, particularly if indications of abuse of power by officials come to light or the economy slows more sharply than we currently forecast.
A newly elected government will have less executive authority
The election of a new government will be accepted with little open resistance in the light of the 2016 constitution referendum result. However, if strict rules prohibiting criticism of the authorities are carried over under the next government, the risk of political instability will rise markedly. This risk would already be high given the military's likely continuing, overtly central role in the political system-the Senate (the upper house of parliament) is likely to be dominated by figures linked to the military. As such, challenges to the next government-in the form of political boycotts and protests-cannot be ruled out. Such challenges are more likely to occur towards the end of the forecast period, especially if the next government fails to preside over a robust and inclusive economic recovery. A significant economic downturn is not our core forecast, however. Moreover, the risk of an armed civil conflict remains negligible, and any major stands against the next government and its constitutionally dictated set-up are likely to be headed by non-military political factions.
The insurgency in the Muslim-dominated southern provinces of Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat will rage on; small-scale attacks targeting security forces and civilian-frequented religious sites have increased in frequency. Peace talks in February 2017 between the military and MARA Pattani, an umbrella group for six separatist movements in southern Thailand, yielded the establishment of "safe zones" in the region, but attacks outside these areas have continued unabated. There also remains a moderate risk of attacks within safe-zone areas owing to the proliferation of insurgent groups outside the MARA Pattani umbrella. Yet, the insurgency presents only a minimal threat to overall political stability. Furthermore, the possibility of the insurgency expanding significantly and spreading to other parts of the country remains low. As such, we do not expect the situation to threaten Thailand's vital tourism sector in 2017-21.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
The outlook for political and institutional effectiveness is more certain in the wake of public approval of the junta-drafted constitution and the smooth accession of the new king. Unlike the previous government, which faced major street demonstrations and legal challenges in opposition to its policies, the junta possesses near-absolute power to implement its agenda as a transitional government until the next elections. Moreover, regardless of the subsequent poll results, the military establishment has in effect sealed overarching power over the next government via the new charter.
The constitution that will be adopted by the next elected government out-lines an administrative structure that is formed, in a larger proportion than previously, of appointed officials and allows such officials to join their publicly elected counterparts in selecting a prime minister. These provisions will make it much easier for the military to dominate government decision-making, while curtailing the power of democratically elected officials. Although such changes are likely to expedite the policymaking process, they bode ill for the public accountability of government.
The junta will ensure that technocrats remain in charge of economic policy
The NCPO has appointed technocrats to manage the economy and is determined to outline a long-term strategy for the country in addition to its short- to medium-term focus on reviving investment and private consumption. Its proposed 20-year "National Strategy" is currently being drafted and the next government will be constitutionally bound to follow it, under the explicit threat of impeachment. It is already clear that infrastructure development is likely to be a core supporting strategy within it, to sustain primary goals including rebalancing public- and private-sector development, and special economic zone development.
Nevertheless, in the near term the junta is likely still to devote significant resources to populist policies when needed to appease key interest groups, such as agricultural producers. Avoiding inflaming future political tensions will remain a key underlying priority. The deputy prime minister, overseeing economic affairs, Somkid Jatusripitak, was the finance minister under a former, populist prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra. Somkid is known for his populist policies that kept the economy strong on the back of fiscal handouts and increased rural income.
However, the military has not made any material progress in reconciling the political differences between the rural population of the north (who supported Thaksin) and the elite in southern Thailand (who are represented by his detractors, the Democrat Party). Therefore, although the military-appointed component of the next government will enjoy efficacy in policymaking, it will still find it difficult to satisfy the two major camps and may face rising opposition from one or both in the medium term-the same tensions that have plagued its predecessors.
Corruption will remain a significant problem in many of the country's institutions, including the military. Transparency International, an international organisation tracking levels of graft, published its benchmark Corruption Perceptions Index for 2016 in January 2017, which suggested that corruption has worsened under the junta's rule. Cases under the next government involving unelected officials, particularly those with explicit military links, may serve as a flashpoint for discontent over the new constitutional system and its lack of accountability. If open discontent does materialise it is more likely to be from a cumulative series of incidents and thus occur later in the forecast period. Continuing corruption in the local police force allows the capital, Bangkok, to host one of the world's largest shadow economies. The junta has made efforts to show a tougher stance against corruption, for instance by setting up a dedicated court to try relevant cases and proposing the death penalty for the involvement of high-level officials, as well as for foreigners, in graft. However, similar initiatives have been popular with past military governments and have only increased the remit of the sizeable shadow economy. There is little reason to believe that the junta and the next government will be any more successful in clamping down on corrupt activities.
Political outlook: Election watch
We believe that the next election will not take place before 2019. With public dissent against the military government's rule at manageable levels, the junta is content to postpone polls repeatedly in the short term. The king's intervention to seek changes to the draft constitution in January 2017 served as a legitimate justification to extend the election timeline without facing fierce criticism from opposition groups. Other pretexts for delays are likely to be found, such as concerns over the security situation relating to the insurgency. However, the public's approval of the draft charter in a referendum, preserving the substantial political influence of the military, has reduced the junta's motivation to delay the poll indefinitely.
Political outlook: Key players to watch
Prayuth Chan-ocha
A former career military officer, Prayuth became commander-in-chief of the military in 2010. In May 2014 he imposed martial law and toppled Thailand's then-caretaker government in a coup, forming a junta known as the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) with himself as leader. In August 2014 the NCPO appointed a military-dominated interim National Legislative Assembly (parliament) and chose Prayuth as interim prime minister. Although Prayuth has made statements in the past stressing the neutrality of the armed forces in Thailand's political struggles, he has made it clear since taking power that his core agenda is biased towards restoring and protecting the economic and political privileges of the country's traditional elite. He will continue to prioritise this group in the remaining period of the junta's pre-election rule in order to marshal support for the subsequent heavily military-influenced government.
King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun
King Maha, the heir to the revered late monarch, Bhumibol Adulyadej, ascended the throne in December 2016. The new king does not command the level of popularity that his father did, owing in part to well-publicised elements of his lifestyle and related scandals. However, the junta has supported the king's traditional role via heavy-handed enforcement of lese-majesty laws and the monarch has moved to consolidate his position, for instance by bringing the royal estate more directly under his control and reducing the opportunities in which power may be deferred to a nominated party. Although the king is likely to continue to take a background role in national politics, he may choose actively to mediate future political disputes involving unscheduled changes of government towards favouring the interests of particular demographics in order to boost his popularity. This means that he has great potential political influence.
Somchai Wongsawat
A Puea Thai party politician and former prime minister, Somchai was acquitted over the forced dispersal of protestors that resulted in two deaths while he was in office in 2008. The case, which was brought by the National Anti-Corruption Commission in 2015, cast a shadow over Somchai's political future. With its resolution he is likely to step back into the fray of national politics and there is a strong chance that he will run for Puea Thai's leadership in the absence of its de facto leaders, Thaksin and Yingluck Shinawatra, who are both barred from Thai politics. Somchai is an experienced and well-known politician and could therefore help to spearhead a significant challenge to the continued dominance of the military in politics via calls to Puea Thai supporters not to participate in the next election or, along with fellow "redshirt" politicians, obstruct actions in the next parliament to frustrate a military-aligned faction's policy agenda.
Yingluck Shinawatra
Yingluck had been a politician for only around two months before leading the Puea Thai party to victory at the 2011 general election, becoming Thailand's first female prime minister. Her political inexperience had been more conspicuous in her policymaking than in her negotiating: she had managed to bring a degree of calm to Thailand's explosive political environment, but some of her economic policies flirted with fiscal disaster and helped to precipitate her downfall. Although being a newcomer to politics, Yingluck struck up a strong rapport with voters and as prime minister she had partly vindicated criticism that she was a stooge for her brother. However, owing to fiscally imprudent economic policymaking, she lost the state coffers millions. This led to the junta filing criminal charges against her for negligence in office over an expensive rice-subsidy programme. She has also in effect been banned from returning to Thai politics as the court case against her continues. However, she retains a sizeable support base and her influence on-and support for-other politicians from her "redshirt" camp cannot be discounted.
Political outlook: International relations
The military's seizure of power initially cooled relations with Western countries. However, links are gradually being restored for the sake of economic ties, as well as wider concerns over political influence in the region, particularly with regard to China's growing presence. The US administration under the president, Donald Trump, indicated in April 2017 that at least a partial rapprochement between the two countries is set to occur before an election, following a telephone call between Mr Trump and Prayuth. Diplomatic and trade ties with the US and other Western countries will improve further following the next poll. The inclusion of a referendum in the charter-drafting process, coupled with the election itself, will be sufficient to fulfil many Western countries' prerequisite for democratic due process in the decision to re-establish ties.
Japan, which is wary of being superseded by China (with regard to large-scale investment projects), has demonstrated a willingness to continue all but top-tier diplomatic ties and bilateral agreement negotiations with Thailand during the junta's rule. This means that major economic co-operation deals between the two countries will go ahead regardless, including infrastructure projects to be built under Japanese contract.
Nonetheless, China's influence in Thailand will grow in the short term as the military-controlled administration looks to the Chinese government for political and economic support before the election. The countries have no conflicting territorial claims in the South China Sea and are important trading partners. Economic ties are set to strengthen further as Thailand focuses on forging bilateral deals between state-owned enterprises under its plan to spur GDP growth through public investment. However, this growing relationship will not be without its setbacks, as illustrated by the stop-start progress of the planned China-Laos-Thailand high-speed rail project. Such tussles will delay the economic benefits of greater regional integration.
Notably, increasing bilateral integration with China seems unlikely to obstruct Thailand's ongoing efforts to engage with its neighbours in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Tensions between other ASEAN members and China in relation to territorial disputes in the South China Sea have cooled, largely in deference to China's economic concessions to various countries in the region.

Effective family-planning programmes, sex education and changing social norms, such as later marriage and smaller families, will keep Thailand's average population growth rate relatively low, at 0.2% a year, in the forecast period. By 2021 the population is forecast to reach 69.5m, with females accounting for 50.8% of the total. Owing to continued improvements in healthcare and childbirth procedures, the infant mortality rate will drop to an average of 8.8 per 1,000 live births in the forecast period, from 9.9 per 1,000 in 2012-16. Life expectancy will also improve, with men expected to live for an average of 71.6 years in 2017-21, up from 70.6 in 2012-16, while female life expectancy will rise from an average of 77.4 to 78.3 years over the same period.
An ageing population will way on the productivity of the economy
Thailand's population is ageing, with the proportion of the population aged under 15 set to fall to 16.1% in 2021, from 18.8% in 2011, and the proportion aged over 65 rising steadily. This will mean that the young-age dependency ratio falls to 0.23 in 2021, from 0.26 in 2011, while the old-age dependency ratio rises from 0.13 to 0.19. This demographic trend will place further strains on healthcare provision. The country's health system is structured around a universal healthcare scheme introduced in 2001, which is coming under increasing strains from the growing old-age population. Under the initial programme, the "Bt30 scheme", which was implemented by the government led by Thaksin Shinawatra in 2001, all Thais were entitled to visit a doctor or hospital for a flat fee of Bt30 (around US$1). Following the coup in 2006 that ousted Thaksin, the military-installed government abolished the Bt30 fee, thus making public healthcare free. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects this scheme to remain free in the forecast period.

The crude death rate is forecast at 8.2 per 1,000 in 2017-21. Age-related non-communicable illnesses such as heart disease, stroke and respiratory diseases are responsible for most deaths in Thailand, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). In its latest country profile for Thailand, road accidents were also a leading cause of death (based on 2012 data). Thailand continues to confront the challenge of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, which in the early 2000s emerged as the country's leading cause of death. Thailand was one of the first countries in Asia to launch a campaign to raise public awareness of HIV/AIDS, and recent figures confirm its effectiveness. The WHO estimates the death rate from the disease at around 23 per 100,000 people in 2016, although 450,000 people continued to live with the disease in that year. Other infectious diseases such as cholera, measles and mumps have become less common but have not been eradicated.
There will remain a high number of migrant workers in Thailand
The labour market will tighten owing to the ageing of Thailand's population, but the emergence of serious labour shortages is unlikely in the next five years. The labour force will expand by 1.7m in 2017-21, to reach 38.6m, reflecting in part a trend of increasing numbers of women choosing to work outside the home. Migrant labour will remain abundant, with often-unregistered workers from neighbouring Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos continuing to dominate unskilled jobs in the construction industry and as household employees. However, Thailand will gradually become a less attractive destination for unskilled migrants over the long term. In the near term this will partly reflect a less welcoming stance on the part of the authorities, who are keen to channel unskilled migrant labour into legitimate strategic industries in border-located special economic zones. In the longer term, job opportunities in Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos will expand as the prospects for economic growth and reform in those countries improve.
Despite slow population growth, the number of households in Thailand is expected to rise strongly in the forecast period, mainly as a result of a reduction in average household size. Internal migration and changing social patterns mean that it is increasingly common for households to consist of nuclear, rather than extended, families. Steady economic expansion in recent years has encouraged this trend, as migrant workers from rural areas have been moving to the major cities, and particularly the metropolitan area centred on the capital, Bangkok. Although the former remains the epicentre for the urban population, other cities, including Surat Thani, Chiang Mai and Hat Yai, have also been growing rapidly. This will result in the urban population increasing to 58.9% of the total population in 2021, from 51.7% in 2016.

Thailand's business environment score increases from 6.62 in 2012-16 to 6.84 in 2017-21. In The Economist Intelligence Unit's global rankings, Thailand improves from 38th to 34th place, but its position in the Asia-Pacific region remains at ninth out of 17 countries. The score for political environment will improve. Political stability will be maintained for much of the forecast period, including after the next government comes to power. This is in large part because the military's central role in the subsequent government will stifle any partisan conflicts and improve political effectiveness. Separatist violence in the south will continue and a new military-dominated government is unlikely to dissipate the long-running, smouldering conflict. The risk of unrest permanently spreading to other parts of the country is low, however.
The government will continue to encourage foreign investment
The macroeconomic environment will stabilise in the forecast period, although it will remain vulnerable to external conditions. An improvement in the scores for policy towards private enterprise and competition and policy towards foreign investment under an elected government will encourage a moderate uptick in investment. This will be aided by an open capital account and a relatively stable currency. However, lacklustre domestic demand will continue to be a major drag on business sentiment, with high household debt and stagnating wages weighing on private consumption prospects. The Bank of Thailand (BOT, the central bank) will remain independent and monetary policy will be fairly conservative. Ambitious transport infrastructure projects boost the score for infrastructure.
Business environment outlook: Thailand's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: The authorities reorganise the management of several state-owned enterprises but do not sell off significant assets. The government gradually reduces subsidies, especially on food and energy, but price controls remain on many goods.
2019-21: Thailand remains on the US Trade Representative's intellectual property watch list despite an improvement in enforcement.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: The government woos foreign investors with the launch of new special economic zones. The Bank of Thailand (BOT, the central bank) limits public short-term foreign debt issuance to ease upward pressure on the baht.
2019-21: Opposition to the sale of assets to foreigners persists, particularly in the utilities sector. The authorities introduce new incentives to promote inward investment in targeted industries while removing incentives in low-value-added sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Community (AEC) improves regional trade flows.
2019-21: Administrative procedures for trade transactions are streamlined, reducing delays. In particular, improvements are made in ASEAN intra-regional trade facilitation, amid efforts to step up integration of the AEC.
Taxes
2017-18: Enforcement of new land, property and inheritance taxes remains uneven. The government maintains the rate of value-added tax (VAT) at 7%.
2019-21: The coverage of land, property and inheritance taxes is actively expanded in order to boost government revenue.
Financing
2017-18: The authorities continue to focus on strengthening the financial sector and increasing its competitiveness. The health of the banking sector improves, and foreign investors continue to enjoy good access to local markets.
2019-21: Banks strengthen their financial position, and the regulatory environment is improved further. The BOT tries to expand the local bond market, primarily by developing a more active secondary market.
The labour market
2017-18: Unemployment remains low and rising labour costs have a negative impact on small and medium-sized enterprises. Labour unrest remains relatively rare, but trade unions vigorously oppose any moves towards privatisation.
2019-21: Shortages of skilled labour become more acute, driving up costs in high-value-added industries. The government loosens immigration controls on foreign skilled workers.
Infrastructure
2017-18: The expansion of road and rail infrastructure moves ahead slowly, providing a boost to the construction sector.
2019-21: A number of transport infrastructure projects proceed to the construction phase but are blighted by delays. A new government continues to explore the potential to develop nuclear power plants domestically, with Chinese assistance.

There will be no major changes in Thailand's macroeconomic environment during the forecast period. However, deteriorating conditions elsewhere will see the country's global ranking improve from 22nd in 2012-16 to 20th in 2017-21, while its regional ranking will rise from seventh position to fifth over the same period. Relatively low public debt, a firmly positive current-account balance and fairly stable fiscal, monetary and exchange-rate policies will underpin macroeconomic stability. After several years of volatility, economic growth has been relatively steady since 2015 and is expected to remain so during 2017-21. Yet a pick-up to above 3.5%-closer to the country's potential growth rate-will prove elusive. This will be mainly owing to the increasing competition from other Association of South-East Asian Neighbours (ASEAN) countries in key high-value merchandise export industries.
The junta's fast-tracking of project approvals will lift investment
The military's control of government has allowed for more decisive approval of budgets and major spending plans. In 2017-18 the junta will continue to use its unchecked powers to fast-track policymaking and the approval of projects, including intermittent populist policies to appease influential interest groups such as agricultural producers. Furthermore, through the constitutionally mandated powers that it has recently secured, it will be able to maintain an influence on policymaking following the next election, in 2019 at the earliest. This will ensure that business-oriented tax reform and investment incentives are maintained and expanded in 2017-21, and that major infrastructure investment projects continue beyond the end of the forecast period. Private investment will continue to struggle in the early part of the forecast period, but this will be counterbalanced by public investment in major infrastructure projects that will act as economic stimulus. The growing tourism sector will provide strong support to domestic demand, particularly in the services sector.
Unlike previous post-coup governments, the junta directly manages important economic portfolios (including the Board of Investment, or BOI, which provides investment incentives). It is expected to continue to exert considerable indirect influence on these following the next elections via its 20-year "National Strategy", which is likely to influence the nature of investment via its priori-tisation of certain industries. The governor of the BOT, Veerathai Santiprabhob, who took the reins in October 2015, is well respected and there is so far no indication that he will bend to political pressure. This should ensure that the BOT remains independent and credible in its regulation of the financial sector and its management of the economy (particularly in setting official interest rates and acting to reduce excess volatility of the baht). Nonetheless, we cannot rule out political influence on the central bank's policymaking should economic conditions worsen significantly. This is not our core forecast, however.
Business environment outlook: Policy towards private enterprise and competition

We expect a slight improvement in policy towards private enterprise and competition as the government makes more aggressive efforts to attract investment. This will help Thailand's global ranking to improve from 36th in 2012-16 to 34th in 2017-21. However, the country's regional rank will remain unchanged owing to concurrent improvements in other Asian countries. The military government has launched an anti-graft campaign, including a new court dedicated to trying corruption cases, but any clear success in tackling the issue is yet to be demonstrated. The favouritism for politically connected businesses under the previous administration led by Yingluck Shinawatra may have been replaced by another patronage system that rewards those allied to the military and the traditional establishment. Proposed reforms to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) will bolster the operational efficiency of state companies. However, privatisation remains a sensitive issue, and it is unlikely that the military-led government or its successor will try to sell off state assets, as this would redistribute economic rents away from current holders and be opposed by the general public. A long-standing area of concern is the lack of protection of intellectual property (IP), but new legal provisions should help to control piracy of digital and online content. The government will continue to use price controls for some basic goods to keep them affordable; prices for goods on the "sensitive" list cannot be changed without the permission of the Ministry of Commerce.
Efforts to curb corruption in the public sector will continue gradually
The corporate governance reform of 56 SOEs controlling assets worth US$340bn will be completed during the forecast period. In 2014 the military-controlled government appointed a so-called super-board to oversee the reform. Another super-board, designed to oversee procurement processes, was esta-blished in 2017. The formation of these bodies may help to curb corruption in the public sector, although progress in this area is likely to be slow. Another new public procurement law will also probably be passed, expanding and improving procurement processes. This will similarly help to reduce corruption and boost competition in the public-private sphere. All of these initiatives are unlikely to be reversed following new elections, as they look likely to be included in the junta-developed, constitutionally binding 20-year National Strategy.
Despite the passage of a new Copyright Act in August 2015, designed to protect IP rights on the internet, the US authorities continue to view the country as one of the worst offenders in terms of protecting IP. In 2017 Thailand remained on the US Trade Representative's Priority Watch List for the tenth consecutive year. The still-prevalent occurrence of IP infringement will hinder the country's progress towards becoming a "digital economy" and act as a disincentive to international brands starting up operations in Thailand.

Thailand will continue to encourage inward investment, especially in higher-value-added industries. Further incentives are almost certain to be rolled out in 2017-21 and investment approvals will continue to be fast-tracked by the BOI. The government will not revive proposals, first touted in 2007, to amend the Foreign Business Act, which would make it more difficult for foreign companies to control Thai entities unless they own a majority of shares.
The BOI's seven-year investment promotion strategy, launched in 2015, offers incentives and government support for foreign investors. This includes incentives for setting up a business in less developed parts of the country and the promotion of special economic zones (SEZs) in border provinces. The latter are in place to take advantage of easier labour flows following the establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in late 2015.
Improved connection to the capital will lift usage of special economic zones
A central pillar of the BOI's new strategy is the creation of at least ten SEZs on Thailand's borders. A large coastal-situated economic zone in the form of the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) has also been designated, capitalising on an existing industrial belt along the eastern seaboard. Significant incentives will be provided for firms in the border SEZs, including double tax deductions on some utilities for a ten-year period, access to cheap credit and the permission to use unskilled foreign labour from neighbouring Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia. Meanwhile, the EEC will benefit from transport infrastructure upgrades better linking it to the capital, Bangkok, and major port areas, in addition to a range of tax and regulatory incentives.
The promotion strategy will also introduce industrial developments based around the notion of "super-clusters". These will be collective industry hubs (for instance targeting automotive, electrical appliances, chemicals, digital, food production and medical industries). The BOI and the Ministry of Finance will provide tax and other incentives. These efforts will be undermined slightly, however, by the below-par prospects for private consumption, which are low by the standards of other countries at Thailand's income level.
Business environment outlook: Foreign trade and exchange controls

Given Thailand's reliance on international trade, the government will retain a favourable foreign-trade regime, trying to accommodate the demands of influential domestic groups inclined towards protectionism while avoiding provoking any retaliation from major export markets. Most import duties for goods from other ASEAN member states have been lifted, following the formation of the AEC at end-2015. Thailand is also party to multilateral trade agreements concluded by the regional grouping, such as those in place with China and India, and a combined agreement with Australia and New Zealand. However, Thailand's existing trade deals allow signatories to exclude a number of sensitive sectors, while also keeping some non-tariff barriers in place. Thailand will continue to adhere to its commitments as a member of the World Trade Organisation. The country has accepted the obligations laid down in the IMF's Article VIII, which stipulates that transactions on the current account should be free of restrictions. Foreign investors do not face restrictions on the repatriation of profits and dividends and the central bank has eased restrictions on outward capital flows. The BOT would reimpose temporary capital controls only if excessive speculative capital flows were judged to be threatening macro-economic stability.
The AEC will remain a leading driver of trade liberalisation
Thailand, along with the other members of ASEAN, will continue to liberalise its trade regime in line with its commitment to implementing the AEC. Freer movement of goods, services, investment and skilled labour (in eight selected sectors) between the ten member states came into effect at end-2015. ASEAN initiatives are often beset by delays and the AEC is likely to be no exception. Still, the liberalisation envisaged under the AEC will, eventually, create new opportunities for Thai firms, as well as increase the threat of competition from foreign companies, particularly in labour-intensive industries.
Free-trade agreements (FTAs) signed by ASEAN with China and India, as well as a combined agreement with Australia and New Zealand, are gradually being phased in. The deal with India eliminated duties on many products in 2016 and talks are under way to include services. The FTA with Australia and New Zealand will be expanded to include 96% of all product types by 2020. Formal talks on a bilateral FTA between Thailand and the EU began in 2013, but were put on hold after the 2014 coup. European and Thai businesses are keen to conclude a deal, which would compensate in part for Thailand's loss of the EU's Generalised System of Preferences status in 2015. Negotiations will resume after a general election takes place, in 2019 at the earliest. As a result, a Thai-EU deal is unlikely to be concluded before the end of the forecast period.
The baht has experienced large swings in its value in recent years as loose monetary policy in the US, Japan and other major economies led to large speculative flows into Thailand in search of higher yields. A rebound in inflows in the first half of 2017, owing in part to lowered investor expectations of stimulatory measures in US and the strengthening external sector, has led to significant appreciation of the local currency against the US dollar. A correction in the form of a strong depreciation will occur in 2018. The BOT will not reintroduce capital controls to stem this decline in the baht:US dollar exchange rate, partly in preference for a weaker currency to aid exporters. However, intermittent intervention in the foreign-exchange market to curb extreme volatility will remain an option.
Business environment outlook: Taxes

Thailand's score in the taxes category remains unchanged at 7.9 in 2017-21. Yet trends elsewhere mean that its global ranking improves from 12th place in 2012-16 to tenth in 2017-21, and by one place, to fifth, in the regional ranking. Thailand's tax regime is relatively simple and changes have been made in recent years to lower the overall burden. Successive governments have aimed to minimise the load on households and firms and lowering taxes has been an important part of this strategy. As a result, its ranking in this area has improved over time (although a relatively low tax-GDP ratio is a fiscal concern in the medium to long term). The standard rate of corporate tax was gradually reduced from 30% in 2011 to 20% in 2013. The government did this with the aim of boosting the country's competitiveness as a destination for foreign investors and to mitigate the impact of higher minimum-wage levels. Tax incentives are also widely available, and on the whole Thailand's fiscal regime continues to provide fairly strong encouragement for new investment. The personal income tax regime is relatively favourable, with the top marginal rate standing at 35% for both Thai and foreign workers on annual earnings over Bt5m (US$145,000).
Tax rates will remain favourable for businesses
The junta repeatedly postponed a hike in the standard value-added tax (VAT) rate in 2014-16. The next government is likely to maintain the rate at 7% until late in the forecast period, when the authorities will look to consolidate the public finances after private consumption returns to a stronger footing. This decision will also be influenced by calls from international organisations such as the IMF to push the rate back up.
With increases to unpopular consumption taxes off the agenda in the earlier part of the forecast period, the military government will push for other tax reforms to raise revenue and expand the tax base. An inheritance tax was approved in July 2015 and a property tax on land and building assets will come into effect in 2018. The latter will levy tax on commercial land and buildings with a ceiling of 2%, but most applicable tax rates will be much lower than this. As such, the impact on business will be minor.
The government will continue to look for opportunities to provide tax sops in a bid to support consumption. These sops will range from allowing individuals to deduct income tax on purchases of selected consumer goods to income tax deductions for domestic hotel and travel expenses in particular tax years. Similarly, the government will support the real-estate market through subsidised loans and other targeted incentives, such as income tax deductions for first-time buyers in lower-income brackets, during the forecast period.
Business environment outlook: Financing

Thailand's score for financing will improve in 2017-21, as the banking sector will be in better health. Moreover, a deterioration in the financing environments of neighbouring countries will result in Thailand's regional ranking for the category rising by one place to sixth, although an improvement in countries outside the region will see its global ranking slip by one place to 22nd. A slow-down in domestic credit growth in 2013-14 reflected weak demand rather than a tightening of lending conditions. Increased due diligence and prudential measures among banks helped in reducing the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans from the mid-2000s until 2013, from which time they have crept up again slightly. However, this situation is expected to reverse, if only moderately, in 2017-21. This will bolster the overall health of the banking sector.
The BOT and the finance ministry will continue to focus on strengthening the financial sector and increasing its competitiveness by implementing a Financial Sector Master Plan, which has already resulted in the consolidation of a number of small and large private- and state-owned financial institutions. Foreign investors enjoy good access to local capital markets.
Capital markets will remain deep and well regulated
The local bond market will continue to expand under the guidance of the BOT. Thailand's bond market remains small compared with its equity market. Government bonds dominate, accounting for about 80% of all bonds issued, but large and medium debt-laden companies are increasingly using the bond market to refinance their bank loans and offshore borrowings. Strengthening demand in this market will continue in the early part of the forecast period, as investors and institutions seek high-yields amid a lack of opportunities in the Stock Exchange of Thailand.

The deterioration in the global and regional rankings for the labour market reflects Thailand's waning competitiveness. The country is a labour-scarce economy and unemployment is low. Labour market conditions will, in general, remain adequate in terms of supporting the operations of foreign-invested enterprises, but weaknesses, especially rising wage costs and skill shortages, will persist. The country's advantages as a cost-efficient base for labour-intensive production are diminishing, amid increasing competition from neighbouring economies such as Cambodia and Vietnam. In addition to rising relative costs for low-skilled workers, general labour shortages are a growing problem. In terms of skilled labour, problems stem in large part from Thailand's underperforming education system, which ranks poorly both globally and regionally and has long focused on rote learning. Although educational reforms have been promised, little practical progress has been made and there are currently no plans for a major overhaul of the system. The ability of the labour force to meet the needs of businesses (in terms of specialist skills) is likely to remain subpar by global standards. Hiring foreign workers will continue to be relatively difficult and expensive, except for labour from other ASEAN countries in designated sectors. In terms of the potential for industrial unrest, Thailand is comparatively attractive as an operating location, as strikes are rare.
Thailand's competitiveness will remain at risk owing to high wages
From January 2017 the nationwide daily minimum-wage schedule was replaced by minimum wages per province, set at or above Bt300 (around US$9). However, there has been no indication that any province has chosen to raise it substantially above the minimum. Moreover, significant future increases in the minimum wage are unlikely because this would further damage Thailand's competitiveness vis-à-vis regional competitors. The low average rate of con-sumer price inflation expected in 2017-21 should also ease the upward pressure on wages.
Thailand is facing the social and economic consequences of a rapidly ageing society, including a steadily declining workforce as a share of the total population. During the forecast period it will introduce steps to mitigate this crisis. It has announced an increase in the retirement age of civil servants from 60 to 65 years, a measure that will invariably put pressure on private employers to follow suit. Accordingly, we expect the average retirement age in the private sector to increase in 2017-21, but this will do little to counter the problems posed by skills shortages on the overall labour market.
Local labour will continue to decline in Thailand, with the country becoming more reliant on migrant workers, mostly from neighbouring Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos and often officially unregistered, who typically fill low-skilled vacancies. The government is in the process of opening SEZs on the country's borders, designed in part to capitalise on the supply of low-cost migrant labour sourced from its neighbours. International concerns for potential human rights abuses in Thailand, especially in the fishing industry, will result in tighter regulation and enforcement of protective measures for migrant workers. Ongoing co-ordination with the Burmese government to register migrants and issue identity documents will help to improve the situation, and will expand access to a (legal) low-cost labour pool.

Thailand's infrastructure will improve moderately in the next five years. The military government has prioritised long-pending "megaprojects", but they will still face significant delays. Improvements to telecommunications services have also been slow. Although the availability of 4G is widespread, average speeds remain slow by regional comparison. Electricity supplies have risen, but the potential for shortages remains. In 2015 67% of the country's electricity was generated using natural gas, according to the latest figures from Thailand's Energy Policy and Planning Office, and over 20% of natural gas is imported, making the country vulnerable to fluctuations in global gas prices. With gas supplies in the Gulf of Thailand in decline, the government's energy plans prioritise diversification of energy sources, including development of renewable energy. The government's Power Development Plan 2015 proposes to more than double the capacity of alternative energy sources by 2036, primarily in solar and biomass, and to import additional hydropower from neighbouring nations.
The junta will focus public investment on infrastructure development
The government has had difficulty securing funding for its ambitious plans to develop infrastructure "megaprojects". Although the junta has moved a number of projects nearer to the construction phase, including the building of dual-track railways, highways and port expansions, the medium-term prospects for a high-speed train linking Thailand and China, via Laos, which was originally agreed in 2010, are still unclear. Funding to build a section of the line between the Thai capital and the north-eastern province of Nakhon Ratchasima was approved in mid-2016, but further sections are yet to be greenlighted. This rail project and others have been slow to progress owing to doubts over their commercial viability and wrangling over financing with Chinese and Japanese investors. Delays also partly reflect the government's efforts to take advantage of the ongoing competition for geopolitical influence between China and Japan-the Thai government has both been seeking the best deal and has taken a cautious approach to shifting its alliances amid China's growing economic clout and Japan's historical investment links. However, we expect significant progress on priority projects in 2017-21. This will in large part be owing to the junta's use of unilateral executive powers, via Section 44 of the interim constitution, to bypass regulatory and political obstacles. Priority projects include road and rail upgrades on the eastern seaboard to link with Bangkok and the expansion of the U-Tapao International Airport, 140 km south-east of the capital.
The state-run Airports of Thailand authority will upgrade the country's six major airports, at an estimated cost of Bt194bn (US$5.7bn). The bulk of the money is earmarked for the expansion of Bangkok's second international airport, Don Mueang International Airport. Expansion works got under way at Suvarnabhumi Airport in 2016, while expansion of the airports in Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Phuket and Hat Yai is currently not a priority. The total capacity of the six major airports will rise significantly, from the current 75m passengers per year, by the end of the forecast period. This will mainly be aimed at accommodating surging arrivals from East Asia, especially China.
Further modernisation of telecoms networks can be expected
Thailand's telecoms networks have been slow to adopt the latest technology, exposing inefficiencies in the regulatory environment. Auctions of 4G bandwidth were completed in 2017. The regulator expects the commercial launch of 5G bandwidth in 2020, although we believe that those auctions will be completed at a similarly slow pace. Moreover, the new bandwidth is likely to lag behind equivalent offerings in most other Asian countries in terms of speed, as with 4G, owing to shortfalls in service provider technology.
The Power Development Plan 2015 lays out clear targets for energy production, consumption and imports in the period to 2036. Overall objectives include reducing reliance on natural gas, increasing imports of electricity from Thailand's neighbours, and ramping up alternative energy production, especially solar and biomass. Nuclear power options are still on the table, but have been subject to delays owing to public opposition, especially following Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear incident in 2011. Thailand will remain reliant on natural gas for electricity production in 2017-21.
Economic forecast: Policy trends

Thailand's military-controlled government has declared economic revival to be its priority and is pursuing policies aimed at boosting consumption and investment, including ramping up public spending on infrastructure. The administration is increasingly utilising Section 44 of the interim constitution, which allows it to pass legislation unilaterally in order to expedite the develop-ment of big-ticket projects. This approach will propel public investment and thereby support economic growth in 2017-21. Although this is positive in the short term, it sets a dangerous precedent in impeding the rights of the local business community and fair competition. It also risks fast-tracking projects at the expense of proper public scrutiny.
Demand-side stimulatory measures have played a prominent role in the junta's policy agenda, and the government is likely to continue to enact minor stimulatory measures over 2017, focused on small and medium-sized enterprises and smallholders in the agricultural sector, which are still struggling following a prolonged period of lacklustre external demand and inclement weather conditions. Nonetheless, the impetus for further such disbursements will lessen in 2018-21 compared with 2014-17 as the authorities seek to consolidate the public finances.

Government revenue 18.1 18.3 18.3 18.0 18.6 18.8
Budget balance -2.7 -2.5 -2.5 -2.6 -2.2 -2.0
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to run a marginally wider fiscal deficit on average in 2017-21 compared with 2012-16. This will be mainly owing to the raft of fiscal reforms aimed at stimulating demand in the forecast period, combined with public spending on infrastructure construction. For instance, higher thresholds for personal income tax and increases to deductible allowances came into effect in early 2017. Other new recurring expenditure, primarily aimed at boosting the junta's popularity, such as the extension of free state education for those aged 12-15 years, will also act as a drag on the budget balance in 2017-21.
This pressure will be offset partially by some revenue-raising measures such as new or increased excise charges on goods like diesel, cigarettes and alcohol. A new inheritance tax, which came into force in February 2016, and the pending reform of property taxes, which should take effect from 2018, will also boost revenue later in the forecast period-but only modestly, owing to the watering-down of original proposals to avoid public objections. In addition, there is a significant possibility that the value-added tax (VAT) rate, currently set at 7%, will be raised slightly later in the forecast period. Although the government will be increasingly eager to expand the revenue base, this reform will be stalled by greater economic uncertainty in the middle of the forecast period as private consumption growth slows. Overall, we expect the fiscal deficit to average the equivalent of 2.4% of GDP in 2017-21, up from an average of 2.2% in 2012-16.

We expect the Bank of Thailand (BOT, the central bank) to remain accom-modative, maintaining its policy rate, the one-day repurchase rate, at 1.5% until 2020. This forecast is based partly on the expectation that consumer price inflation will strengthen only modestly in 2017, averaging 0.8% for the year as a whole, below the BOT's target range of 1-4%. The BOT's modest expectations for the economy in 2017, heavily influenced by global uncertainties, will persist in the middle of the forecast period, as economic growth in China slows sharply in 2018 and the US economy experiences a cyclical downturn the year after. As such, the BOT will not feel confident in raising rates until 2020, when inflation accelerates again amid stronger conditions for domestic and external demand.

Real GDP will maintain a growth rate of 3.3% in 2017, the same as in 2016, as public-investment drives are expanded but import growth accelerates at a faster rate than exports. External demand will dip in 2018-19, tempering headline GDP growth in those years. We expect real GDP growth to average 3% a year in 2017-21, down from 3.4% in 2012-16.

Private consumption growth, which accounts for a significant share of GDP, will be supported in part by the still-strong tourism sector. However, we expect it to record a pronounced dip in the middle of the forecast period as weakening external demand in 2018-19 undermines domestic economic activity. It will pick up again after the economy sees a broader, sustained recovery in 2020-21.
We expect a modest recovery in external demand in 2017, after a pronounced dip in 2015-16. This will be heavily supported by rising demand from Asia. Growth in exports will then ease again in 2018-19 owing to a steep slowdown in growth in China in 2018 and a cyclical downturn in the US in 2019. However, this will be softened somewhat by the underlying trends of rising demand from Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states and the still-expanding tourism sector. These will also aid the economic rebound expected in 2020-21.
From the tepid levels seen in 2016, private domestic and foreign investment will stay firm in 2017-18 as business confidence grows on the back of optimism for the ASEAN region and the accelerating momentum of Thailand's public infrastructure investment drive. Overall investment will be weighed down by lower external demand in 2019, but burgeoning prospects in surrounding ASEAN countries will hasten the return of more robust investment growth in 2020-21. This uneven outlook notwithstanding, the government's public-investment drive will lend substantial support to total fixed investment in 2017-21. As a result, gross fixed investment will grow by an average of 3% a year in the forecast period, compared with 2.9% in 2012-16.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
On the supply side of the economy, we expect the industrial sector to grow the fastest, at an average annual rate of 4.2% in 2017-21. Thailand has been successful in taking the lead in certain industrial sectors relative to its neighbours, such as the automotive industry, in addition to some high-technology subsectors, most notably electronics and machinery components. However, its technical capabilities and competitiveness are slowly declining owing to a lack of investment in the sector. The industrial sector grew by a lacklustre 2.1% in 2016 as other regional manufacturing bases continued to rise in competitiveness and global demand dipped. Industrial growth will recover in 2017-21 amid increased public investment in infrastructure and a more stable and business-friendly policy environment. Stronger external demand in the early and latter parts of the forecast period will buoy investment sentiment in the largely export-oriented sector. Over the longer term, Thailand risks losing its role as a predominant producer of intermediate manufactured goods to fast-growing countries in the region that have cheaper labour.
The services sector will grow by an annual average of 2.6% in 2017-21. Despite a slowdown in growth in the sector in 2014, resulting from the coup in that year, growth averaged 4.8% a year in 2012-16 amid surging tourist arrivals from the wider Asian region, especially China. In the forecast period the growth rate will normalise somewhat owing in part to slowing growth in tourism expenditure. Nonetheless, the retail sector-the largest component of services-will continue to expand over the forecast period, albeit at a slower rate. In addition, the financial sector remains relatively healthy. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans has risen slightly since 2014, but it still remains far below the levels seen prior to the 2008-09 financial crisis and banks are well capitalised. Growth in household debt slowed in 2015-16, although the already-elevated levels of debt here will crimp demand and dampen the expansion of the sector as a whole in 2017-21. The telecommunications segment will see strong growth with the development of 4G networks under licences awarded in 2016, which will allow firms to meet surging demand for mobile internet services. This will dovetail with the expansion of e-commerce platforms in the country.

The agricultural sector will remain vulnerable to extreme weather cycles, including droughts and floods. Productivity is also likely to suffer as tentative efforts to reform the sector are repeatedly set back by inclement weather events, which will also mean that producers are largely unable to upgrade from current basic technologies. Some subsectors, such as fishing, will struggle early in the forecast period as the industry adapts to the market-access requirements of Western countries regarding labour rights and the government clamps down on unregistered migrant labour. We expect the agricultural sector to grow by an annual average of 2.5% in 2017-21.

In 2017 a modest recovery in global commodity prices and firming domestic demand will lead to a gradual increase in inflationary pressures, resulting in consumer prices rising by an average of 0.8%, up from 0.2% in 2016. Despite a weakening exchange rate in 2018-19, inflationary pressures will remain subdued owing to stagnation in commodity prices and sluggish consumer demand. Stabilising domestic and external demand in the latter part of the forecast period will push consumer price inflation to an annual average of 1.7% by 2021.

The baht has strengthened considerably against the US dollar since the beginning of 2017. In part, this reflects investors' increasing confidence in Thailand and emerging-market Asian economies in general, particularly vis-à-vis the US, where uncertainty over government policy persists. However, like many emerging-market Asian currencies, we expect the baht to be affected by the steep slowdown in China's economy and associated instability in financial markets in 2018. In nominal terms, the baht will weaken by 2.2% a year on average against the US dollar over 2018-19. The latter part of the forecast period will see a restoration in the currency's value as macroeconomic fundamentals strengthen, with the baht appreciating by an annual average of 1.2% in 2020-21.

Since 2014 Thailand has enjoyed a substantial current-account surplus, primarily owing to weaker global commodity prices that led to weakness in imports. The current-account surplus rose to the equivalent of 11.7% of GDP. In 2017-19 the surplus will narrow from 11.9% of GDP to 10%, owing partly to stronger import growth in 2017 and weaker export demand in 2018-19, following a significant slowdown in China and a technical recession in the US. A slightly higher surplus will be seen in 2020-21 when external demand firms again. The surplus on the services account will continue to rise, owing to the robust tourism sector. However, we expect increasing competition from the rest of the region to temper growth in tourist arrivals, after strong gains in 2014-16. The primary income account will remain in deficit in 2017-21, reflecting the continued repatriation of profits and dividends by foreign-owned firms. However, this will be partly offset by the effect on the secondary income account of personal transfers, notably remittances.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Thailand
Stocks and flows
Net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows (including earnings reinvested by companies already operating in Thailand) were volatile in 2012-16 owing to natural disasters and political instability that was disruptive for the business environment. Net flows struggled throughout 2012-15, registering a marginally positive annual average of US$1.4bn in that period, owing in part to political instability from 2014. In 2016 net FDI flows turned sharply negative, averaging US$12.6bn, owing in part to the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej as well low investor confidence in the Thai economy. In 2016 the stock of inward FDI stood at US$193.5bn, equivalent to 47.5% of GDP.
Origin and distribution
The privately owned manufacturing sector attracts the largest proportion of FDI inflows into Thailand. In particular, manufacturers of automotive parts and producers of electronics and electrical appliances have attracted significant foreign interest in recent years. The financial and real-estate sectors have also gained prominence. Historically, Japanese firms have been the main investors in Thailand. In 2016 the value of approved Japanese investment projects accounted for 57.2% of the total value of approved wholly owned foreign investment, according to the Board of Investment (BOI, a government agency). Investment from China has also greatly increased in the past few years. Chinese investors, even more so than their Japanese counterparts, are likely to gain from Thailand's infrastructure development plans, but these will essentially come in the form of services contracts in construction and logistics planning.
Determinants
Thailand has traditionally been an attractive investment destination, owing to its relatively competitive labour costs, flexible labour laws and advantageous location within the region. However, some of these advantages have been fading amid sporadic political uncertainty and increasing competition from later-developing regional neighbours. Incentives offered by the BOI generally take the form of exemptions from corporate income tax and reduced taxes on imported machinery. The BOI also offers non-tax incentives, including granting permission to bring in foreign workers, own land and take or remit foreign currency abroad. Thailand has generally been regarded as open to foreign investment. Although regulatory uncertainties do exist, the government has actively tried to address these quickly. Indeed, the large-scale Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) special economic zone, first proposed in 2016, includes fast-tracked environmental assessments as an incentive. The EEC fits within the BOI's seven-year investment promotion strategy launched in February 2015 that extended incentives to newer industries such as "alternative energy and environmental services" and "hospitality and wellness", while removing existing incentives in certain low-value, labour-intensive industries. The BOI has also been encouraging investment into infrastructure, through a small number of "big-ticket" projects. Although a backlog of proposals accumulated in the period leading up to the 2014 coup, the BOI subsequently expedited the investment application and approval process, and will continue to do so in an effort to stimulate economic activity prior to the next elections.
Impact
Inflows of FDI have been volatile over the past decade. The ratio of FDI inflows to GDP fell to 1.8% in 2009 owing to the global economic crisis. Following this, FDI inflows fluctuated in 2010-16 amid flood damage and repeated bouts of political uncertainty. Large FDI inflows have helped to support overall economic growth and have contributed to Thailand's development as a leading exporter to other countries in Asia in a number of sectors, including vehicles (particularly light pickup trucks), electronics (notably hard-disk drives) and electrical appliances.
Potential
Following the public approval of the junta-drafted constitution at a referendum in 2016 and the smooth accession of the new king, Thailand's political scene has gained a foothold of political stability. Challenges to the new political structure and next government are unlikely to materialise before late in the forecast period at the earliest, which bodes well for steadier FDI flows in the forecast period compared with 2012-16. However, a number of other challenges may limit the potential for strong growth in FDI in the next five years. Thailand's attractiveness as a location for investment has been diminishing owing to a rising relative cost base (particularly for labour) and sluggish domestic demand outside the tourism sector. Although the current administration is keen to show a commitment to liberalisation, mainly through the legally binding 20-year National Strategy, access to important sectors such as telecommunications and utilities in the medium term remains in question. Although the standard of infrastructure in the country has improved in recent years, it remains poorer than that in Malaysia, a rival manufacturing location. However, the junta is demonstrating renewed vigour in this regard with an ambitious infrastructure development programme. Although Thailand will continue to attract foreign investment by virtue of its leading position in the development of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free-Trade Area, there is a risk that it may lose out to other countries in the region as they make improvements to their business environments at a faster rate.

Thailand constitutes a sizeable market in its own right, with a population of 69m and nominal GDP equivalent to around US$407.2bn at market exchange rates in 2016. Moreover, the development of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free-Trade Area means that firms located in Thailand will continue to enjoy almost entirely duty-free access to ASEAN's population of 500m, including a burgeoning middle class with growing disposable incomes.
The retail sector will benefit from the strong tourism industry
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that aggregate personal disposable income will grow at a slightly slower rate in 2017-21 than it did in 2012-16, but at a more consistent pace owing to a generally more stable political environment. Even so, the very large tourism sector will lend support to the retail sector. The latter will expand by 1.6% a year on average in 2017-21.
National wealth distribution remains alarmingly disparate between the regions, according to the latest data from the Asian Development Bank. Of the 10.5% of the population defined as living in poverty (in 2015, living on US$1.90 or less per day at purchasing power parity), the majority reside in the rural north and north-eastern parts of the country. The capital, Bangkok, remains the wealthiest region by far: personal disposable incomes there are double the national average. Measures to narrow the wealth gap undertaken by governments have tended to be short term in nature and unsustainable. Thus, market oppor-tunities in the rural areas remain limited compared with urban centres.
A fairly small proportion of personal disposable income in Thailand is spent on accommodation, leaving a greater share available for spending on consumer goods. Demand for consumer goods is therefore high compared with that in many other countries in Asia. As the level of household debt subsides, the release of pent-up demand will boost retail sales towards the end of the forecast period. Nevertheless, debt burdens among those on lower incomes will put a dampener on overall consumer sentiment, and could limit the prospects for social mobility among this group.

Private consumption will grow by an annual average of 2.7% in 2017-21, slightly weaker than the rate of 2.8% in 2012-16. The next government will maintain policies aimed at supporting consumption through various subsidies and other support packages aimed at helping low-income citizens and occasional short-term measures to stimulate spending by higher-income groups. Given the still-frail state of private consumption, the value-added tax (VAT) rate is unlikely to be raised from the current level of 7% until later in the forecast period, despite previous discussion on doing so. The government will instead focusing on wealth taxes, such as the new inheritance and property taxes, which will avoid burdening lower-income households, although certain "sin taxes" on alcohol and tobacco will still have a minor impact on the population at large.
Expenditure on healthcare and leisure will rise as the population ages
Consumer expenditure on essential items, such as food, household goods and clothing, will fall slightly as a proportion of total expenditure as average incomes rise. The average individual outlay on hotels and restaurants is likely to increase as a result of several trends: a rise in the number of women who work (leading to a fall in the number of meals cooked at home); government efforts to promote domestic tourism; and cheaper domestic travel owing to the expansion of budget airlines and rail routes. Expenditure on leisure and education, which generally rises as economies become more developed, is not expected to grow significantly, as average incomes will remain relatively low. Growth in healthcare spending is forecast to moderate, owing to relatively comprehensive free state healthcare, which we do not expect to be rescinded in 2017-21. We expect healthcare spending in local-currency terms to rise by 4.8% a year on average in 2017-21, down from 7.4% in 2012-16. The projected increase in spending on transport and communications will largely reflect the expanding market for information technology products, which will be boosted by national upgrades to internet services.

Initial conditions: The past decade has been characterised by political turmoil in Thailand, with two coups between 2006 and 2014 and many (sometimes violent) anti-government protests and rallies. Economic growth has been volatile in the years since the 2008-09 global financial crisis owing to natural disasters and political crisis. Although the military-led government that ousted the populist administration of Yingluck Shinawatra in May 2014 has made economic recovery a priority, growth has remained relatively sedate. Political instability caused many reforms and development works to be neglected and interrupted. Physical infrastructure remains inadequate in many respects and under increasing strain, with little progress on this front in recent years. Reform of the education system, which is sorely needed, has long been promised, but successive governments have largely failed to modernise the curriculum. As a consequence, the workforce is characterised by a low level of technical skills.
Thailand will become increasingly more dependent on migrant workers
Demographic trends: Thailand's population will age over the long-term forecast period. Slower population growth and longer life expectancies will account for the demographic shift. The female labour force participation rate, which was strong in the early 2000s, is expected to rise only modestly in the 2030s and 2040s. This will lead to an average annual contraction of 1% in the labour force in 2031-50. Nevertheless, a gradual loosening of regulation con-cerning immigrants' right to work will preclude a steeper fall in the size of the workforce. Successive governments are likely to be forced to ease immigration policies further owing to the country's negative demographic profile.
External conditions: Thailand faces a challenging external environment in the period to 2050. Although many export-oriented, labour-intensive industries will shift away from China, Thailand will struggle to capitalise on this opportunity owing to a lack of competitiveness compared with lower-cost locations, such as Cambodia, Vietnam and Bangladesh. New regional rivals will also gain ground, including Laos and Myanmar. Closer integration with China could open up market opportunities for Thai businesses in more niche subsectors. One possibility is that Thailand may develop itself as a services centre for China, meeting that country's increasing demand for foreign holidays, regional-specific agricultural goods and other niche products. There already signs that this is under way in the tourism sector with the Tourism Authority of Thailand spearheading a move towards the luxury end of the Chinese market. However, Thailand still has a long way to go before it is in a position to welcome large numbers of high-end visitors-the ongoing expansion of transport infrastructure will go some way to addressing this. Similarly, economic and trade links will be strengthened by the development of overland transport routes between China and Thailand in the next decade or so. The development of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Community, formally established in 2015, will motivate business and technical innovation in Thailand such that it retains its prominence in the region.
The challenges to democracy will be addressed gradually
Institutions and policy trends: The power struggle between the established military and bureaucratic elites in the capital, Bangkok, who will continue to side with the palace to bolster their legitimacy, and the rural masses that form the majority of the Thai electorate may ease in the decades ahead. However, this will be conditional on successive governments finding a path to restruc-turing the agricultural economy, including moving a far greater proportion of the workforce into industry and services. Democratically elected governments might be successful in instigating such a shift with the introduction of appropriate electoral reforms as well as a focus on medium- to long-term rural development policies, rather than just short-term relief measures.
Long-term performance: The long-term outlook for Thailand's economy is heavily dependent on whether the next military-dominated government is able to sustain the political authority required to initiate appropriate structural reform that will continue into the medium to long term, in addition to upgrading infrastructure. Implementing comprehensive liberalisation in a number of important sectors, such as power and communications, will help Thailand to regain some of its competiveness relative to its regional neighbours. The effects of an ageing population could be offset by improving educational attainment on the part of the existing workforce or by measures to facilitate greater immigrant access to the labour market. However, progress is likely to be slow in both areas.

Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines ten separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, and infrastructure. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 16 (infrastructure), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2012-16) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2017-21). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2012-16. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2017-21 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
The main sources used in the business rankings model include CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce; Freedom House, Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties; Heritage Foundation, Index of Economic Freedom; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; UN, Human Development Report; US Social Security Administration, Social Security Programs Throughout the World; World Bank, World Development Report; World Development Indicators; Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Report.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2012-16 ranges are then used to derive 2017-21 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2017-21, not to the likely situation in 2021 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2014 or 2019). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Although the regime of the president, Nicolás Maduro, will strengthen its grip on power following the installation of a Constituent Assembly, we do not expect Mr Maduro to remain in power beyond 2019. The most likely scenarios for a transition to an opposition-led government are through ad hoc elections after economic collapse (probably as foreign-exchange shortages culminate in debt default) or a military coup. There is a risk that the regime will cling on to power as either Chinese or Russian finance helps the sovereign to avoid debt default, or should Mr Maduro be replaced by another PSUV official to appease critics.
Inflation is likely to exceed 1,000% by 2018. The risk of hyperinflation will rise as the government increasingly prints money for spending. After an estimated recession of 14% in 2016, GDP is forecast to contract by a further 9% in 2017 and 6% in 2018. High inflation has led to a collapse in private consump-tion and difficult operating conditions have hurt investment. We forecast a weak recovery beginning only in 2020, by which time the current opposition is expected to be in government, leading to a combination of macroeconomic adjustments, and institutional and structural reforms.
Sweeping reforms are required to restore confidence in contract and property rights, and thereby promote a recovery in investment. The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. From 2019 a new government will encourage private investment, re-establish market mechanisms for price stability and attempt to undo the constraints imposed by the PSUV on private firms.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and triple-digit inflation will hit private consumption, and the increasingly difficult operating environment will accentuate the fall in fixed investment. The recession that began in 2014 will continue to deepen despite a partial recovery in oil prices and the economy will not return to growth until 2020. Our forecast for a weak recovery in 2020-21 rests on the assumption of a new government that implements macroeconomic adjustment alongside institutional and structural reform. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
At almost 300bn barrels, Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves, but its oil sector has suffered from disinvestment and mismanagement owing to political interference. The government claims that rising investment in the energy sector will lift oil production significantly in the medium term, but we foresee a continued fall in production in 2017, and only a minor increase from 2018 as economic conditions stabilise.

Venezuela is in 79th position globally in our business environment rankings for 2017-21, out of 82 countries covered. It is therefore one of the least attractive investment locations. This reflects state interventionism, highly heterodox macroeconomic policies, a lack of legal security and weak institutions. Regionally, Venezuela moves ahead of Cuba to 11th place of the 12 countries covered, assuming improvements after 2019.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Government persists with bias against free markets and ad hoc recourse to heterodox measures. Nationalisation poses a diminished threat, given fiscal weaknesses. Property rights remain weak. Price fixing undermines profitability.
2019-21: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Access to project financing is difficult and uncertainty over contractual rights persists.
2019-21: Efforts to attract foreign investment gather pace under a new government, although actual investment flows remain fairly low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2017-18: Frequent ad hoc adjustments to the unorthodox exchange-rate policy framework add to uncertainty. The state continues to exercise tight control over access to official-rate US dollars. Private firms must use a much weaker rate.
2019-21: Efforts to remove trade and exchange controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly, after a political transition takes place.
Taxes
2017-18: Government's low approval ratings reduce the risk of tax increases, despite the huge fiscal deficit. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2019-21: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2017-18: Credit growth remains firm, but sectoral allocation is distorted by administrative interventions. Banks remain highly profitable, although unpredictable enforcement and a weak regulatory framework heighten instability.
2019-21: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2017-18: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. An ongoing freeze on redundancies, combined with a large informal sector and skill shortages, makes the labour market exceptionally rigid.
2019-21: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Access to water and electricity supplies remains precarious. Underinvestment in power transmission ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2019-21: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued electricity rationing.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Chávez was diagnosed with cancer in 2011 but, after declaring in July 2012 that he had fully recovered, won a fourth presidential term in October 2012. However, his health quickly deteriorated and he died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has since plummeted.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is a federal republic, successive administrations have proven reluctant to devolve political authority, with the transfer of financial resources from federal to local level highly dependent on the central government. The legislature is unicameral, and elections for the National Assembly take place every five years. In December 2015 the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the legislature. In August 2017 the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) installed a Constituent Assembly with powers over all branches of government and a remit to rewrite the 1999 Constitution-apparently a ploy to entrench the PSUV in power.
Policy issues: Political radicalisation has been reflected in increasingly heterodox economic policymaking, with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus, and the nationalisation of industries deemed strategically important. Distortions created by this approach have become evident, with inflation rising sharply in spite of price controls, and with capital controls spawning a rampant black market for foreign exchange. Failure to invest part of the oil windfall has led to a startling decline in physical infrastructure. Non-oil production has in effect ground to a halt, leaving the economy entirely dependent on the energy sector. With large oil shipments going to China to repay loans, and (on subsidised terms) to regional neighbours via the PetroCaribe oil-financing scheme, the country is running very short of US dollars, forcing cuts in import spending.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 60% for oil firms. Since 2011 a maximum royalty of 95% has applied to oil extraction. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Official data are unavailable, but The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$7bn in 2016 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages. The current-account deficit is estimated to have fallen from 4.3% of GDP in 2015 to 1.8% of GDP in 2016.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
Political and social tension will remain high following a controversial vote on July 30th organised by the president, Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), to establish a Constituent Assembly with powers over all branches of government-including the opposition-controlled National Assembly-and a remit to write a new constitution. Although The Economist Intelligence Unit is maintaining its forecast for a change of government midway through the 2017-21 forecast period, we no longer believe that this is likely to happen via elections scheduled for December 2018, which the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD) would be well-placed to win, given the govern-ment's unpopularity amid a growing economic and humanitarian crisis. Mr Maduro seems little concerned about the ever more damning criticism from the international community, with even the veiled threat of US economic sanctions proving no deterrent to the president's plans to consolidate power through increasingly authoritarian ways.
We now no longer believe that Mr Maduro will feel pressured into holding an election that he risks losing as scheduled in December 2018. But nor do we expect that he will manage to cling to power for the entire 2017-21 forecast period, on the basis that economic conditions seem set to deteriorate further, producing unsustainable pressure for a change of government. International oil prices are not expected to rise to such a level to provide the foreign-exchange proceeds needed to ease chronic consumer goods shortages (Venezuela depends heavily on imports) and allow the government to meet external debt obligations falling due over the next 12-15 months. We therefore believe that a transition involving the opposition is likely in the medium term.
Given the highly volatile political situation, accurately forecasting when and how a transition of power will occur is challenging. We believe that there are two main ways in which a transition of power might come about. The most likely scenario involves Mr Maduro muddling through for the remainder of 2017 and much of 2018, running down reserves to meet external debt repayments, but ultimately being unable to avoid a debt default, perhaps in the context of the imposition of sanctions by the US on Venezuela oil imports. This would be likely to bring about Mr Maduro's downfall, as his allies in government and the military would be hit financially, and remaining popular support from his constituents (chiefly the poor and public-sector workers) would fade owing to heightened economic hardship as hand-outs dry up. This would lead to a transition to a government led by the opposition.
Another potential transition scenario involves a military coup in late 2017 or 2018, triggered by dissent among the ranks of the armed forces. Although successive PSUV governments have given increasing power to the generals and trained lower-ranking soldiers ideologically so as to cultivate pro-PSUV sentiment, unease among other stakeholders in the armed forces appears to be growing, judging by sporadic episodes of rebellion in recent months. Under both transition scenarios we would expect free and fair elections to be held.
Although it is not our baseline forecast, we recognise that there is a high risk that the PSUV will cling on to power. If, for example, Russia or China were to provide sufficient financial assistance to allow Venezuela to avoid default and boost oil output, or if oil prices were to rise significantly beyond our expectations, there is a possibility that the government would manage to withstand political pressure for elections and regime change. In another possible scenario, Mr Maduro could leave office but be replaced by another high-ranking PSUV official in an attempt to appease critics. However, no likely successor to Mr Maduro would appease opposition demands for elections and political transition, and tension would remain high.
One challenge for the opposition will be to maintain the momentum of protests that began in April (over 120 people have died so far, mostly at the hands of the security forces), in order to try to achieve its objectives. The scale of protests is likely to wax and wane in response to government measures to stifle democratic procedures and those that are likely to persist will be from the more violent and hardline "resistencia".
Regardless when and how political transition occurs, the second half of our forecast period is likely to remain volatile and uncertain. The broad, diverse opposition coalition will have to contend with huge economic distortions and deep political differences that would test even a unified political party. Although we expect significant financial support from multilateral lending agencies, the risk of renewed political volatility will remain high, even under an opposition government.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
In both our transition scenarios we assume that elections will eventually be held and will be free and fair, ushering the MUD-led opposition into power. That said, and as part of its efforts to cling to power in the meantime, we expect that the Maduro regime and the Constituent Assembly will push back the schedule for the next presidential election, which is due in December 2018.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Following the installation of the Constituent Assembly, Venezuela has become much more isolated diplomatically and is coming under increasing regional and international pressure. To date this has done little to weaken the government's grip on power, but the growing threat of US sanctions could prove significant. The US president, Donald Trump, has threatened strong but unspecified economic measures against Venezuela. This probably would entail firstly a cut in US exports of distillates that Venezuela needs for its oil exports, lifting costs and hence reducing foreign-exchange proceeds, before ultimately cutting US purchases of Venezuelan oil, a move that would cripple the economy. Mr Trump recently suggested that he does not rule out unspecified military actions, although at this stage we assume that this is bluster. Mercosur, a regional bloc comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, has suspended Venezuela indefinitely owing to "violations to the constitutional order", and a group of major countries in the region have denounced the regime and say that they will not recognise laws passed by the new Constituent Assembly. The Vatican, which has in the past tried to mediate between the government and opposition, has also criticised the Constituent Assembly.
A return to negotiations, brokered perhaps by Cuba (its closest ally) and Colombia (its neighbour), could potentially provide a path to fresh elections and a political transition, but huge obstacles remain. Another key priority for the Maduro administration will be the maintenance of good relations with China (a key creditor) and Russia, whose state oil company, Rosneft, is active in Venezuela. It is possible that Russia will help Venezuela to muddle through for longer by providing much-needed external financing in exchange for lucrative oil contracts for Rosneft. Reflecting its external financing difficulties, Venezuela will continue to scale back-or possibly end-oil shipments to beneficiaries of PetroCaribe, an agreement providing cheap financing for oil exports to regional allies.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
It is unlikely that the government will be able to manage the build-up of inflationary and currency depreciation pressures without significant policy adjustments. We assume that the Maduro government will be forced to weaken the currency more substantially in 2017-18 than it has done so far. However, other much-needed reforms are unlikely to be addressed by a government that has proved unwilling or technically incapable of adjusting policy sufficiently to move Venezuela's economy away from the brink of collapse. Fiscal and monetary policies will remain expansionary, and ad hoc policy intervention-ism and heavy state control of the economy will persist. Amid subdued oil prices, import compression will remain necessary, as other sources of foreign exchange will be hard to find. We currently expect Venezuela to meet its 2017 obligations, which are mostly owed by PDVSA, the state-oil company. However, given the extremely thin reserves cushion (less than $10bn in August), we have now factored into our forecasts the likelihood of a debt default in 2018, which would have dramatic consequences in the form of lower oil production, reduced import capacity, hyperinflation and political turmoil.
In our baseline scenario, we expect the opposition to hold power by 2019, ushering in much-needed, market-driven adjustments designed to correct currency distortions, alleviate shortages of basic goods, tighten expansionary fiscal policy and rebuild institutional capacity after years of deterioration under PSUV rule. It is probable, given the scale of the challenge, that the new government will seek a financing agreement with the IMF to support the adjustment process; we have factored in accumulated lending of over US$16bn in 2019-21. Efforts to secure increased inflows of foreign direct investment would also be likely under a new government, and would help to improve the balance-of-payments dynamics, although we expect direct investors to remain cautious for some time with regards to Venezuela, with the possible exception of the oil sector.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
The authorities' failure to publish data on the non-financial public sector since 2012 demonstrates the opacity of the public finances and complicates accurate forecasting of the size of the deficit. After ballooning to an estimated 24.3% of GDP in 2016, we expect the deficit to stand at a still-large 19.5% of GDP in 2017 and remain in double digits in 2018. A transition to a new government should help to ease the deficit to 4.2% of GDP by 2021. The large deficits of the present are mostly being financed by printing money; the money supply (M2) rose by nearly 340% year on year in July, the highest rate on record. High inflation and an overvalued currency are eroding the relative value of domestic and external debt, making debt/GDP ratios unreliable indicators of fiscal stability. There is considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing, mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA. As these items are excluded from the public debt statistics, the true size of total public liabilities is understated. Our forecasts now assume that Venezuela will default on its external debt at some stage in 2018. This will be followed by a restructuring process with external creditors under an MUD-led opposition government.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
Monetary policy under the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) will continue to be driven by the government's desire to keep real interest rates negative and to print money to finance large fiscal deficits. In the context of extremely high inflation, we expect real rates to remain deeply negative in 2017-18. Our forecast of substantial currency and fiscal adjustment under a new government in 2019 also implies a substantial tightening of monetary policy. We expect interest rates to rise sharply that year, declining only moderately thereafter.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Ongoing disruption to Venezuela's productive base and a collapse in consumer spending mean that we project further contractions in real GDP in 2017-19. Our forecast for a recovery in 2020-21 rests on our assumption of slightly higher oil prices, alongside a political transition that produces a combination of macroeconomic adjustment (supported by IMF financial assistance), and institutional and structural reform. However, reform will take time to bear fruit, given the scale of the recession, and our forecasts therefore imply only a partial rebound, after a decline in real GDP of nearly 30% in 2014-19.
After dropping by over 20% in 2016, private consumption will continue to contract in 2017-18, reflecting the effect of soaring inflation on real wages, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will continue to contract sharply, reflecting the difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange, and remitting profits. Our forecast for a recovery in invest-ment in 2019-21 assumes a political transition, progress on long­delayed joint projects with Chinese firms in energy and-later in the forecast period-a pick-up in public-sector investment. Exports will continue to shrink in 2017 as oil production falls further, but will pick up in 2019-21, reflecting renewed investment under a new government and a removal of constraints to domestic production. Import demand will rise faster than exports, in line with an alleviation of basic goods shortages and the release of pent-up demand from recession. Even after the change in govern-ment, however, dependence on oil will persist.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
A decimation of domestic supply and severe shortages of foreign-exchange reserves have caused inflation to soar for much of the past two years, and in the short term there is little sign that the situation will improve, despite deep reces-sion. No new official inflation data have been released since end-2015, but since the start of the year the National Assembly has begun producing a consumer price index. This showed monthly inflation of 26% in July, bringing accumu-lated inflation for January---July to 249%. Assuming that price pressures remain high, we expect average inflation to exceed 850% in 2017 and reach 1,220% by the end of 2018 (this is an upwards revision of the forecast included in our previous monthly report for Venezuela). However, we continue to forecast a decline in inflation over time, reflecting moderately higher oil prices, which will bring in the necessary foreign exchange to help to alleviate scarcity of goods, and the effect of persistent recession on demand. From 2019 fiscal and monetary policy adjustment will also be supportive of a gradual reduction in inflation towards double-digit levels (in year-on-year terms). However, for now, a lack of funds available for importing basic goods suggests that shortages will be rife, and the risk of hyperinflation (monthly inflation of over 50%) will remain substantial.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
Amid huge pressures on the dual-currency exchange-rate system, our forecasts assume substantial devaluations in 2017-18, but the exchange rate will still be extremely overvalued. The dual exchange-rate system is composed of an official peg, known as the Dipro, which is limited to priority public-sector imports and set at BsF10:US$1, and a heavily managed rate known as the Dicom. On August 11th, at the twelfth auction since the government revamped the Dicom system in May, the BCV sold US$24.2m at BsF2,970:US$1, implying an annual 76% devaluation of the Dicom rate. However, the Dicom accounts for only 10% of all official transactions. In real terms, the average exchange rate (weighted by volume of transactions) has continued to appreciate, creating ever greater pressure for currency adjustment, the need for which is evident in the black-market rate; this was over BsF14,000:US$1 in mid-August.
The pegged Dipro rate appears increasingly unsustainable, and we assume that the government will devalue the rate later this year and again in 2018. We also expect the government to increase the share of Dicom in foreign-currency transactions-in effect a maxi-devaluation. We assume that further major currency adjustment under a new, MUD-led government in 2019 will involve immediate exchange-rate unification. Until that occurs, given existing distortions in the foreign-exchange market, there is an extremely high risk of a debilitating currency crisis in the short term. If confidence in the bolívar collapses amid hyperinflation, dollarisation-or the launch of a new domestic currency-could occur.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
The current-account deficit will narrow further in 2017, reflecting severe import compression and a moderate recovery in oil prices, which will outweigh a continued decline in oil output. A sharp fall in oil output in 2019 will lift the current-account deficit. In 2020-21 a recovery in oil output will help to offset a rise in imports after years of pent-up demand and in line with an easing of external financing constraints. Our assumption of economic adjustment in the medium term suggests some recovery in capital inflows, particularly into the oil sector. Together with IMF loans, this should help to rebuild reserves coverage, although our forecasts assume that even by the end of the forecast period in 2021 reserves will cover only slightly more than three months of goods and services imports.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The grand coalition of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) fell apart in May 2017 following the resignation of the ÖVP leader. An early election will be held on October 15th.
The popularity of the ÖVP new leader, the young minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, means that the election has become a three-horse race between the SPÖ, the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) and the ÖVP, which will be rebranded on the ballot as the "List Sebastian Kurz-the New People's Party". The most likely coalition to emerge is one that is led by the ÖVP and includes the FPÖ, although negotiations to form one could be fraught.
The inclusion of the FPÖ in the government would not lead to similar EU sanctions as in 2000, when the party was last part of a coalition, owing largely to the normalisation of the far right in Europe since then.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects any new government to focus on integration and immigration policy, and to attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and introduce some additional flexibility in labour and product markets. However, low government cohesion is likely to lead to limited progress.
The government budget is forecast to remain in deficit, albeit well within the EU-mandated limit of 3% of GDP, throughout the forecast period (2017-21), as the fiscal consolidation process is likely to be restrained by limited government cohesion and effectiveness. The public debt/GDP ratio will fall gradually.
After several years of underperformance compared with its regional peers, the economy has performed relatively strongly since the start of 2016, growing by 1.6% in 2016 and 1.9% year on year in the first quarter of 2017. We forecast continued catch-up growth this year, at 2%, and that growth will moderate to 1.5% on average in 2018-21.
Consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) will continue to exceed the euro zone average in 2017-21, driven by structural domestic factors including higher unit wage costs and more regulated markets. Annual inflation averaged 1% in 2016, up from 0.8% in 2015, and we forecast an annual average of 2% in 2017-21.
In 2016 the current-account surplus decreased slightly, to 1.7% of GDP. We forecast that it will average about 2% in the coming years as a weakening trade balance is offset by strong tourism receipts.

Austria's business environment score improves slightly between the historical period (2012-16) and the forecast period (2017-21). As a result, the country remains in 12th place in the regional ranking but loses two places in the global ranking, dropping to 21st. Austria's strengths as a business location include decent infrastructure, stable institutions and co-operative labour relations, but high taxes, limited market opportunities and restrictive regulations will persist.
Country forecast overview: Austria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Government works on reducing red tape, but progress likely to be limited.
2019-21: Modest strengthening of competition authority's powers. Administrative reform reduces red tape. More transparency in antitrust proceedings. Risk of political interference in private firms in which state owns substantial stakes.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Foreign investment is generally welcome, but underlying opposition to takeovers of "national champions" persists.
2019-21: Possible erosion of barriers against foreign takeovers as a result of commercial pressure and EU legislation.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: No exchange controls. Foreign trade, governed by EU rules, should remain liberal.
2019-21: EU likely to accelerate shift towards bilateral free-trade agreements as multilateral trade negotiations stagnate. Little progress on EU-US trade deal. Free-trade agreement between the EU and the UK.
Taxes
2017-18: No significant changes to the tax system, owing in part to a likely deterioration in government effectiveness.
2019-21: Some tax reform is likely assuming a government including the Freedom Party (FPÖ) takes power in 2017. Vested interests will continue to hamper large-scale reform, and the high tax burden will remain.
Financing
2017-18: Financial stability to improve amid tighter regulatory requirements and a reduction in risk from exposure to central and eastern Europe. Credit conditions ease gradually as banks' profitability recovers.
2019-21: Introduction of systemic risk buffer of banks' risk-weighted assets. Further uptake in corporate bond issuance.
The labour market
2017-18: Economy-wide minimum wage introduced. More stringent requirements for early retirement and invalidity pensions. Labour market slowly improves as increase in labour supply moderates and unemployment starts to drop.
2019-21: Continued expansion of labour supply, primarily via net immigration, but concerns about shortage of skilled employees in certain sectors are likely to persist. Early retirement phased out.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Further take-up of broadband services. Gradual improvement of transport links with eastern Europe.
2019-21: Improved transport network connecting main urban centres and providing better access to the country's interior. Gradual transition to low-carbon economy entails significant changes to electricity transmission infrastructure.

Background: Austria became an important force in central Europe with the formation of the Habsburg empire in the 15th century and remained so until the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the first world war. The Republic of Austria emerged in 1918. In 1938 Austria was incorporated into the German Third Reich. With the departure of the victorious Allied forces in 1955, it regained independence as a neutral country. In the post-war period Austria took great strides to catch up economically with the rest of the developed world and is now one of the most advanced nations. It is a member of the EU and a participant in the economic and monetary union (EMU).
Political structure: Austria is a federal republic and the head of state is the federal president. The government is led by the federal chancellor. The national parliament has two houses: the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house), of 62 members appointed by state parliaments, and the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house), which has 183 members elected by proportional representation. An early general election will be held on October 15th 2017.
Policy issues: The government's stated priorities are to reduce the budget deficit and debt pile, improve labour market participation rates, strengthen competitiveness, increase expenditure on research and development, continue to reform healthcare expenditure, stabilise the financial sector and raise educational standards. Progress on these issues will be modest at best, as tensions surrounding immigration, security and border controls will remain elevated across Europe, diverting attention to security and migration-related policy areas.
Taxation: According to the European Commission, Austrian labour tax as a percentage of GDP is the second highest in the EU. A 2016 tax reform lowered the tax burden for low- and middle-income earners, but raised the top personal income tax rate from 50% to 55%. Social security contributions, shared between employers and employees, are high. Corporation tax is levied at a rate of 25%. Dividend and investment income is subject to a withholding tax of 27.5%. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a standard rate of 20%, and a reduced rate of 13% (raised from 10% in 2016) applies for certain goods and services.
Foreign trade: In 2016 the value of exported goods was US$142.8bn and the goods import bill was US$143bn. The services surplus, traditionally boosted by tourism receipts, was US$11.3bn. Along with a modest primary income deficit and significant secondary income deficit, this yielded a current-account surplus equivalent to 1.7% of GDP.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
Following several years of little progress on reforms, and coalition and party in-fighting, the grand coalition of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) fell apart in May 2017 following the resignation of Reinhold Mitterlehner from the positions of vice-chancellor, minister of economy and leader of the ÖVP, citing frustration within his own party. The popular 30-year-old minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, has taken over the leadership of the ÖVP and will run as the party's lead candidate in the early general election on October 15th. However, probably owing to the party's recent poor performance in the polls (it has languished in third place over the past year) Mr Kurz decided to leverage his own popularity by demanding full control over the ÖVP and that the party appear on the ballot as "List Sebastian Kurz-the New People's Party", which would also include a number of people not previously associated with the ÖVP. Following Mr Kurz's arrival as party leader the ÖVP shot to the top of the polls, pushing the opposition far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) to third place, from first. This "Kurz effect" could wane slightly in the coming months, as Mr Kurz has been forced to continue working in the dysfunctional coalition, will face increasing scrutiny of his policies and will need time to build new structures to lead a reformed ÖVP. As a result, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the election to be a three-horse race between the ÖVP, the SPÖ and the FPÖ, although we expect the ÖVP to be best placed to emerge as the largest party in the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house of parliament).
Nevertheless, the election will be a further step in the fraying of the decades-long dominance of the political scene by the SPÖ and the ÖVP, as the ÖVP will have been replaced to a large extent by Mr Kurz's new movement. The two parties have together ruled the country almost continuously since 1945, and a renewed grand coalition has become almost impossible following the break-down of relations between the two parties and the gridlock in recent years. The FPÖ has profited from this and from concerns about immigration, although Mr Kurz looks to be drawing voters away from the FPÖ, in large part based on his strong stance on immigration and border control.
The most likely coalition to emerge after the election is one led by the ÖVP, with the FPÖ as a junior coalition partner, as the other parties-including the Greens and NEOS, a liberal party-are unlikely to be large enough to help either the SPÖ or the ÖVP to reach a parliamentary majority. Risks to this outlook are high, as the election could turn and coalition negotiations could falter, because the FPÖ will probably demand significant concessions from Mr Kurz. Regard-less of which coalition emerges, we expect political stability to deteriorate further. The government will struggle to implement its policies, as the coalition partners are likely to disagree on economic matters, and the FPÖ is likely to struggle to translate its opposition on matters such as immigration and inte-gration into concrete policy proposals. As a result, we expect little progress on significant structural reforms and the risk of an early election in the next parliamentary term to be high.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
The next general election is scheduled for October 15th 2017. The most likely scenario is that the rebranded ÖVP under Mr Kurz will win the largest share of the vote, although not an outright majority, and subsequently form a coalition with the FPÖ.
Elections for some state parliaments are planned for the first half of 2018. The next election for the primarily ceremonial post of federal president will be in 2022.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Austria was severely affected by the European migrant crisis, and this has been the dominant issue in its domestic politics and international relations since 2015. The country has been at the centre of many of the intra-EU spats regarding the bloc's response to the large influx of migrants, owing in part to its unilateral actions. Domestic pressure on the government to be seen as acting against this influx, and thus often against other EU member states, will remain high owing to the strong position of the FPÖ. All three of the large parties have hinted that they want to limit labour migration within the EU, or at least give preferential treatment to Austrian citizens in the labour market, which will exacerbate tensions with many EU member states.
We expect a new government to continue along the same line. Although the previous inclusion of the FPÖ in government following the election in 1999 led to sanctions being imposed by other EU nations in 2000, we do not expect this to be repeated should the party join the next governing coalition. Although at that time a far-right nationalist party entering government was a relatively unusual development, since then sister parties to the FPÖ have either entered government or supported minority governments in parliament in several EU countries, including some Nordic countries and the Netherlands.
The rerun of the presidential election in December 2016 demonstrated the relatively broad support for EU membership. Many voters cited as one of their main reasons for voting for Alexander Van der Bellen-the independent candidate running against Norbert Hofer, the FPÖ candidate-suggestions by Mr Hofer of a possible membership referendum in Austria if the EU did not reform or if Turkey joined. This experience should moderate any further attempts by the FPÖ to use the EU as a divisive issue.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
Alongside the 2016 tax reform, which provided about EUR5bn in tax relief to households, government policy has focused on challenges facing the country's financial sector. These have included the clean-up and debt restructuring of Heta Asset Resolution, a "bad bank" that was created to deal with the toxic assets of Hypo Group Alpe Adria (HGAA). The uncertainty surrounding Heta was removed in October 2016, when creditors accepted a debt-restructuring deal. The government has also had to manage the banking sector's exposure to central and east European economies.
In the renegotiation of its coalition agreement in January 2017 the coalition decided on a number of measures that it hoped to implement before the end of its term, in 2018. These included a new annual minimum wage of EUR21,000, as opposed to only sector-specific negotiated minimum wages, and reducing red tape for employers, including more flexible rules on working hours. However, although the coalition parties agreed to implement a number of these measures before the election in October, we expect little progress, as both parties will be focused on the election and, in the case of the ÖVP, on reforming the party itself.
The next government, which is likely to include the FPÖ, will move integration and immigration policy further to the right and is likely to focus on improving the business environment, including by reducing the sizeable tax wedge, but we expect it to struggle to implement significant structural reforms rapidly.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
In 2014 Austria's fiscal accounts deteriorated, mainly reflecting the govern-ment's decision to create a bad bank to deal with HGAA's toxic assets. The fiscal deficit widened to the equivalent of 2.7% of GDP, from 1.4% in 2013, and public debt rose to 84.4% of GDP. Mainly in response to steady direct revenue growth, the deficit narrowed to 1.1% of GDP in 2015, but widened again in 2016, to 1.6%, owing in part to fiscally expansionary tax reforms and higher migrant-related public spending.
We expect the budget to remain in deficit throughout the forecast period (2017-21), albeit safely within the EU mandated limit of 3% of GDP, as fiscal con-solidation will continue to be limited and growth solid, though unspectacular. The public debt stock as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline gradually, from 84.6% in 2016, following a positive contribution from the Heta deal, to 75.9% in 2021. In the context of the quanti-tative easing (QE) undertaken by the European Central Bank (ECB) and Austria's relatively strong fundamentals, funding risks are extremely low in our view.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
The ECB is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero, a series of so-called targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) aimed at pushing banks to lend more money and a EUR60bn per month QE programme, which will run until the end of 2017. However, the economic recovery in the euro zone has maintained momentum-supported by an acceleration in credit growth-and looks to be more broad-based. We expect another healthy expansion of real GDP in the euro zone in 2017, of 1.9%, after growth of 1.9% on average in 2015-16. Although commentary from the ECB's president, Mario Draghi, was cautious in tone following the policy meeting in July, Mr Draghi revealed that the bank's policy-setting governing council would be discussing the future of the QE programme in the autumn of this year. We maintain our view that the bank will begin gradually to wind down, or "taper", the programme in 2018. Nevertheless, underlying price pressure remains relatively subdued, and downside risks to wage growth and the global economy during that year could yet slow the pace at which the ECB reduces its monthly asset purchases. We forecast that the ECB will not raise policy rates before the end of our forecast period, in 2021.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Austria's initial recovery from the global financial crisis was respectable in the euro zone context, but subsequently the economy largely stalled and under-performed in comparison with regional peers, notably Germany; this was particularly striking given the traditionally high level of synchronisation between the two countries' business cycles. A faltered reform process has contributed to higher inflation compared with regional peers and weakened productivity growth, admittedly from fairly high levels. Real GDP rose by a sluggish 0.8% in 2015, and although it accelerated in 2016, to 1.6%, remained below Germany's 1.8% growth.
However, the economy has recently started to gain momentum again, with average quarterly growth of 0.6% between July 2016 and March 2017. Although the labour market had in previous years struggled to integrate the significant increase in the labour force, it seemed to have turned a corner in late 2016 and early 2017, when the unemployment rate started to fall. This is supporting private consumption, which we expect to grow by 2% this year, and the upturn in growth throughout the region is supporting export growth, with exports to other EU economies up by 11.5% year on year in the first quarter. As a result, we expect real GDP growth to accelerate to an upwardly revised 2% this year, broadly in line with that of regional peers.
We expect the current phase of catch-up growth-following an under-performance even compared with fundamentals in recent years-to continue next year, when we forecast that the economy will expand by 1.7%. A worsening global economic environment in 2018-19, when we expect a policy-driven slowdown in China and a cyclical slowdown in the US, will weigh on growth in the second half of our forecast period, as will the continued lack of reform progress. Domestic demand will be the main driver of growth, which is likely to converge towards potential growth in these years. We therefore expect average real GDP growth of just 1.4% in 2019-21.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
Annual consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) has been subdued in recent years, but higher than in most other euro zone countries. Inflation averaged 0.8% in 2015 and 1% in 2016-well above average inflation in Germany and the euro zone in both years. This largely reflects structural domestic factors, such as higher unit wage costs, more regulated markets and a period of faster increases in taxes and duties. Rising services prices, energy price base effects and the lagged feedthrough of euro weakness via import costs fostered a gradual rise in inflation from October 2016, and will continue to do so in the rest of 2017, when we forecast full-year average inflation of 2%. We expect inflation to stay above the euro zone average in 2018-21, at 2% on average, as similar structural factors as in previous years persist.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
The euro has moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1 since mid-2015. The annual average exchange rate was US$1.11:EUR1 in 2016, although a sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following the presidential election in the US led to a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1. The euro has since rallied as the region's economic recovery has continued and political risk has waned. More recently, a rise in expectations of QE tapering by the ECB has prompted a sharp appreciation in the euro against the dollar. Although the value of the euro may yet come under pressure from political risk-especially in relation to the election in Italy, which we expect to take place in early 2018-and monetary tightening in the US, we have revised up our forecast for the exchange rate, to US$1.12:EUR1 on average in 2017-18, from US$1.08:EUR1 previously. The euro derives structural support from a large current-account surplus, and we expect it to appreciate further in the final years of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
Low oil prices and subdued domestic demand compressing import values helped the trade balance to move into surplus in 2014-15, from a deficit in 2009-13. The recent recovery has pushed up imports and moved the trade balance back into a small deficit in 2016. We expect growth in domestic demand and a slight rise in oil prices to weigh on the trade balance in the coming years. However, this will be compensated for by a healthy surplus on the services balance, driven in large part by robust tourism inflows. We therefore expect continued current-account surpluses in our forecast period, of about 2%.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The struggle between an opposition-dominated legislature and a government with control of key institutions will keep tension high and sustain uncertainty regarding The Economist Intelligence Unit's political and economic forecasts. Despite the unpopularity of the administration led by the president, Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), and economic woes, we believe that the government will muddle through until the next elections are held in December 2018, after which we expect the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática coalition to take office. A risk exists that the PSUV will seek non-democratic ways to cling to power.
A fundamental rebalancing of the economy is needed to avoid default and economic collapse, but there has been no sign of significant economic reform. Policy mismanagement will persist while Mr Maduro remains in office. Key problems include extremely expansionary macroeconomic policy, soaring inflation and a business climate that discourages investment. A new government will begin a gradual process of adjustment from 2019.
Sweeping reforms are required to restore confidence in contract and property rights, and thereby promote a recovery in investment. The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. From 2019 a new government will encourage private investment, re-establish market mechanisms for price stability and attempt to undo the constraints imposed by the PSUV on private firms.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and triple-digit inflation will hit private consumption, and the increasingly difficult operating environment will accentuate the fall in fixed investment. The recession that began in 2014 will continue to deepen despite a partial recovery in oil prices and the economy will not return to growth until 2020. Our forecast for a weak recovery in 2020-21 rests on the assumption of a new government that implements macroeconomic adjustment alongside institutional and structural reform. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
At almost 300bn barrels, Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves, but its oil sector has suffered from disinvestment and mismanagement owing to political interference. The government claims that rising investment in the energy sector will lift oil production significantly in the medium term, but we foresee a continued fall in production in 2017, and only a minor increase from 2018 as economic conditions stabilise.

Venezuela is in 79th position globally in our business environment rankings for 2017-21, out of 82 countries covered. It is therefore one of the least attractive investment locations. This reflects state interventionism, highly heterodox macroeconomic policies, a lack of legal security and weak institutions. Regionally, Venezuela moves ahead of Cuba to 11th place out of the 12 countries covered, assuming improvements after 2019.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Government persists with bias against free markets and ad hoc recourse to heterodox measures. Nationalisation poses a diminished threat, given fiscal weaknesses. Property rights remain weak. Price fixing undermines profitability.
2019-21: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Access to project financing is difficult and uncertainty over contractual rights persists.
2019-21: Efforts to attract foreign investment gather pace under a new government, although actual investment flows remain fairly low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2017-18: Frequent ad hoc adjustments to the unorthodox exchange-rate policy framework add to uncertainty. The state continues to exercise tight control over access to official-rate US dollars. Private firms must use a much weaker rate.
2019-21: Efforts to remove trade and exchange controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly, after a political transition takes place.
Taxes
2017-18: Government's low approval ratings reduce the risk of tax increases, despite the huge fiscal deficit. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2019-21: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2017-18: Credit growth remains firm, but sectoral allocation is distorted by administrative interventions. Banks remain highly profitable, although unpredictable enforcement and a weak regulatory framework heighten instability.
2019-21: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2017-18: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. An ongoing freeze on redundancies, combined with a large informal sector and skill shortages, makes the labour market exceptionally rigid.
2019-21: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Access to water and electricity supplies remains precarious. Underinvestment in power transmission ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2019-21: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued electricity rationing.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Chávez was diagnosed with cancer in 2011 but, after declaring in July 2012 that he had fully recovered, won a fourth presidential term in October 2012. However, his health quickly deteriorated and he died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has since plummeted.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is a federal republic, successive administrations have proven reluctant to devolve political authority, with the transfer of financial resources from federal to local level highly dependent on the central government. The legislature is unicameral, and elections for the National Assembly take place every five years. In December 2015 the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the legislature, but its powers have been usurped by other branches of government dominated by the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV). In May Mr Maduro announced that he wanted to rewrite the 1999 Constitution-apparently a ploy to entrench the PSUV in power.
Policy issues: Political radicalisation has been reflected in increasingly heterodox economic policymaking, with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus, and the nationalisation of industries deemed strategically important. Distortions created by this approach have become evident, with inflation rising sharply in spite of price controls, and with capital controls spawning a rampant black market for foreign exchange. Failure to invest part of the oil windfall has led to a startling decline in physical infrastructure. Non-oil production has in effect ground to a halt, leaving the economy entirely dependent on the energy sector. With large oil shipments going to China to repay loans, and (on subsidised terms) to regional neighbours via the PetroCaribe oil-financing scheme, the country is running very short of US dollars, forcing cuts in import spending.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 60% for oil firms. Since 2011 a maximum royalty of 95% has applied to oil extraction. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Official data are unavailable, but The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$5.8bn in 2016 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages. The current-account deficit is estimated to have fallen from 4.3% of GDP in 2015 to 2.1% of GDP in 2016.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
As the most severe economic crisis in the country's history continues, political uncertainty will remain extremely high in the context of huge social unrest. Since April the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD) has been organising demonstrations against attempts by the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) government to increase its grip on power through non-democratic means. In May the president, Nicolás Maduro, announced rules, heavily skewed in the regime's favour, for the selection of members to a constituent assembly charged with rewriting the constitution promulgated by his predecessor, Hugo Chávez (1999-2013). The selection is due to take place on July 30th. Constitutional reform proposals seem designed to not only reduce the role of the elected National Assembly and to severely crimp the opposition's ability to compete in national elections due to be held in December 2018, but also possibly postpone the elections, perhaps indefinitely. The MUD won control of the National Assembly at the December 2015 elections, but the government has since effectively eliminated the National Assembly's legislative powers by circumventing the body via the PSUV-controlled Supreme Court.
The violent public protests that began in April have led to the deaths of nearly 100 civilians; these demonstrations show little sign of letting up, but, equally, seem to have done little in terms of weakening the Maduro government's hold on power. However, recent developments, including growing international uneasiness with events in Venezuela, may have put Mr Maduro on the back foot. A key opposition leader, Leopoldo López, was recently moved to house arrest after being controversially imprisoned on charges of public incitement to violence in 2014, and the opposition successfully organised an unofficial plebiscite on July 16th in which over 7.5m people voted, most against the government's efforts to redraft the constitution. The PSUV's grip on authority is largely based on the continuing support of the military, which will play a decisive role in future political developments. The govern-ment has, to date, secured military backing by eliminating dissent in its upper echelons and by including the military in a system of patronage that has given it significant policymaking powers. It is not certain to what extent the military would be willing to support the government if it were to attempt to hold onto power by non-democratic means.
The opposition is working to encourage defectors from within government and military ranks. It is possible that it may offer immunity from prosecution as an enticement to switch sides. On this basis, The Economist Intelligence Unit still bases its forecasts on the assumption that presidential and legislative elections will take place in December 2018. We expect the MUD, the clear favourite, to win these elections and take power in 2019. But there is a high risk that the PSUV, with the backing of the armed forces, will attempt to cling to power beyond this date. Given the scale of opposition to the government, and the increasingly limited means of addressing opposition concerns via institutional channels, there is also a strong risk of some sort of chaotic, violent political transition, particularly in the context of a crippling economic crisis that the government has shown little willingness or capacity to address. A short-term trigger for such a crisis could include sovereign default or the imposition of sanctions by the US. An interruption of dollar flows from oil sales stemming from either of these events would be deeply damaging to the government.
Assuming that an MUD-led government does take power, we expect it to implement economic adjustments to reduce the state's role in the economy, and unravel the many macroeconomic distortions that the PSUV has introduced since 1999. It will also begin the difficult task of reforming deeply politicised institutions. Given the scale of the economic distortion and institutional destruction that has taken place in Venezuela, as well as the heterogeneous nature of the MUD-which is aligned mainly in its desire to remove the current government from office-the process will not be a smooth one. Weak institutional capacity and high political tension will persist.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
With the next presidential election due in December 2018, the electoral authorities are placing a host of obstacles in the MUD coalition's path, forcing most parties to re-register and banning a leading opposition figure and presidential frontrunner, Henrique Capriles, from running for election for 15 years, citing "administrative irregularities" in his tenure as governor of Miranda state. Nevertheless, assuming that open elections are held, we expect the MUD to win by a substantial margin (as it did in legislative elections in 2015). The timing of the elections and the capacity for the opposition to compete in them fairly is, however, increasingly uncertain. The contro-versial constitutional redrafting proposed by Mr Maduro entails a long rewriting process and will supposedly be put to a nationwide referendum, steps which would take time and could well be used as a pretext for delaying elections. The position of the military towards any such efforts, and to the election process itself, will be decisive, and the risks to our forecasts are unusually high.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Even though a handful of small Caribbean island members of the Organisation of American States (OAS, an institution promoting regional co-operation, and a frequent election observer) helped to scupper a forceful rebuke at the annual assembly in June, Venezuela is isolated diplomatically and coming under increasing regional and international criticism. To date this has done little to weaken the government's grip on power, but the growing threat of sanctions by the US could prove significant. The US president, Donald Trump, has threatened strong but unspecified economic measures against Venezuela (probably a cut in US purchases of Venezuelan oil) if the government goes ahead with the controversial July 30th constituent assembly vote. Other countries in the region and in Europe have also urged Venezuela to abandon the constituent assembly. A return to negotiations, brokered perhaps by Cuba (its closest ally) and Colombia (its neighbour), could potentially provide a path to fresh elections and a political transition, but huge obstacles remain. Another key priority for the Maduro administration will be the maintenance of good relations with China (a key creditor) and Russia, whose state oil company Rosneft is active in Venezuela. Reflecting its external financing difficulties, Venezuela will continue to scale back-or possibly end-oil shipments to beneficiaries of PetroCaribe, an agreement providing cheap financing for oil exports to regional allies.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
It is unlikely that the government will be able to manage the build-up of inflationary and currency depreciation pressures without some sort of policy adjustment between now and the presidential election. We assume that the Maduro government will be forced to weaken the currency more substantially in 2017-18 than it did last year. However, other much-needed reforms are unlikely to be addressed by a government that has proved unwilling or unable to adjust policy sufficiently to move Venezuela's economy away from the brink of collapse. Fiscal and monetary policies will remain expansionary, and ad hoc policy interventionism and heavy state control of the economy will persist. Amid subdued oil prices, import compression will remain necessary, as other sources of foreign exchange will be hard to find. We currently expect Venezuela to meet its 2017 obligations, which are mostly owed by PDVSA, the state-oil company. However, given the extremely thin reserves cushion (under $10bn in July), the risk of a disorderly default remains extremely high; this would have dramatic economic and political consequences in the form of a sharp decrease in oil production, reduced import capacity, hyperinflation and political turmoil.
We expect the opposition to take power in 2019, ushering in much-needed, market-driven adjustments designed to correct currency distortions, alleviate shortages of basic goods, tighten expansionary fiscal policy and rebuild institutional capacity after years of deterioration under PSUV rule. It is probable, given the scale of the challenge, that the new government will seek a financing agreement with the IMF to support the adjustment process; we have factored in accumulated lending of over US$16bn in 2019-21. Efforts to secure increased inflows of foreign direct investment would also be likely under a new government, and would help to improve the balance-of-payments dynamics, although we expect direct investors to remain cautious for some time with regards to Venezuela, with the possible exception of the oil sector.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
The authorities' failure to publish data on the non-financial public sector since 2012 demonstrates the opacity of the public finances and complicates accurate forecasting of the size of the deficit. After ballooning to an estimated 24.3% of GDP in 2016, we expect the deficit to stand at a still-large 19.5% of GDP in 2017 and remain in double digits in 2018. The election of a new government should help to ease the deficit to about 6% of GDP by 2021. The large deficits of the present are mostly being financed by printing money; the money supply (M2) rose by nearly 340% year on year in July, the highest rate on record. High inflation and an overvalued currency are eroding the relative value of domestic and external debt, making debt/GDP ratios unreliable indicators of fiscal stability.
There is considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing, mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA. As these items are excluded from the public debt statistics, the true size of total public liabilities is understated. In 2016 the government undertook a bond swap that saw about US$2.8bn of PDVSA debt due in 2017 pushed out to 2020. Even after this deal, we continue to see an extremely high risk of default and that some form of debt restructuring-either distressed or otherwise-is increasingly likely in most scenarios.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
Monetary policy under the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) will continue to be driven by the government's desire to keep real interest rates negative and to print money to finance large fiscal deficits. In the context of extremely high inflation, we expect real rates to remain deeply negative in 2017-18. Our forecast of substantial currency and fiscal adjustment under a new government from 2019 also implies a substantial tightening of monetary policy. We expect interest rates to rise sharply that year, declining only moderately thereafter.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Ongoing disruption to Venezuela's productive base and a collapse in consumer spending mean that, after a massive contraction in GDP in 2016 (estimated at 14%), we project a further contraction, of 7%, in 2017 (this represents a downward revision from last month, reflecting the effect on activity of ongoing widespread protests). We do not expect the government to make the necessary adjustments to bring about economic recovery, and expect recession to persist into 2019. Our forecast for a recovery in 2020-21 rests on our assumption of slightly higher oil prices, alongside a political transition that produces a combination of macroeconomic adjustment (supported by IMF financial assistance), and institutional and structural reform. However, reform will take time to bear fruit, given the scale of the recession, and our forecasts therefore imply only a partial rebound, after a decline in real GDP of nearly 30% in 2014-19.
After dropping by an estimated 20.2% in 2016, private consumption will contract further in 2017-18, reflecting the effect of soaring inflation on real wages, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will continue to contract sharply, reflecting the difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange, and remitting profits. Our forecast for a recovery in invest-ment in 2019-21 assumes a political transition, progress on long­delayed joint projects with Chinese firms in energy and-later in the forecast period-a pick-up in public-sector investment. Exports will continue to shrink in 2017 as oil production falls further, but will pick up in 2019-21, reflecting renewed investment under a new government and a removal of constraints to domestic production. Import demand will rise faster than exports, in line with an alleviation of basic goods shortages and the release of pent-up demand from recession. Even after the change in govern-ment, however, dependence on oil will persist.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
A decimation of domestic supply and severe shortages of foreign-exchange reserves have caused inflation to soar for much of the past two years, and in the short term there is little sign that the situation will improve, despite deep reces-sion. No new official inflation data have been released since end-2015, but since the start of the year the National Assembly has begun producing a consumer price index. This showed monthly inflation of 18.3% in May, bringing accumu-lated inflation for January---May to 127.8%. Assuming that price pressures remain high in the first half of 2017 at least, we expect average inflation to be higher this year, at nearly 570%, than in 2016. However, we continue to forecast a decline in inflation over time, reflecting moderately higher oil prices, which will bring in the necessary foreign exchange to help to alleviate scarcity of goods, and the effect of persistent recession on demand. From 2019 fiscal and monetary policy adjustment will also be supportive of a gradual reduction in inflation towards double-digit levels (in year-on-year terms). However, for now, a lack of funds available for importing basic goods suggests that shortages will be rife, and the risk of hyperinflation (monthly inflation of over 50%) will remain substantial.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
Amid huge pressures on the dual-currency exchange-rate system, our forecasts assume substantial devaluations in 2017-18, but the exchange rate will still be extremely overvalued. The dual exchange-rate system is composed of an official peg, known as the Dipro, which is limited to priority public-sector imports and set at BsF10:US$1, and a heavily managed rate known as the Dicom. On July 11th, at the seventh auction since the government revamped the Dicom system in May, the BCV sold US$29.4m at Bs2,700:US$1, implying an annual 76% devaluation of the Dicom rate. However, the Dicom accounts for only 10% of all official transactions. In real terms, the average exchange rate (weighted by volume of transactions) has continued to appreciate, creating ever greater pressure for currency adjustment, the need for which is evident in the black-market rate; this stood at BsF8,470:US$1 in mid-July.
The pegged Dipro rate appears increasingly unsustainable, and we assume that the government will devalue the rate later this year (to BsF20:US$1) and again in 2018 (to BsF400:US$1). We also expect the government to increase the share of Dicom in foreign-currency transactions-in effect a maxi-devaluation. We assume that further major currency adjustment under a new, MUD-led government in 2019 will involve immediate exchange-rate unification. Until that occurs, given existing distortions in the foreign-exchange market, there is an extremely high risk of a debilitating currency crisis in the short term. If confidence in the bolívar collapses amid hyperinflation, dollarisation-or the launch of a new domestic currency-could occur.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
The current-account deficit will narrow further in 2017, reflecting severe import compression and a moderate recovery in oil prices, which will outweigh a continued gradual decline in oil output. The deficit will widen thereafter, on the assumption that economic recovery draws in imports on a large scale after years of pent-up demand and in line with an easing of external financing constraints. Our assumption of economic adjustment in the medium term suggests some recovery in capital inflows, particularly into the oil sector. Together with IMF loans, this should help to rebuild reserves coverage, although our forecasts assume that even by the end of the forecast period in 2021, reserves will cover only slightly more than three months of goods and services imports.

Abstract: The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. Since the 2010 crisis the traditional party system has broken down. According to recent opinion polls, popular support for staying in the euro zone is waning, although a majority still supports membership. [...]as part of negotiations regarding the division of Cyprus, Turkey insists that its troops should be kept on the island, whereas Greece and Greek Cypriots are adamantly opposed. First-quarter data show that the budget is being kept under control by cutting expenditure.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
In September 2015 Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza)-the party of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras-won the snap election (the second in 2015) and formed a coalition government with the right-wing, nationalist Independent Greeks (AE). The Syriza-AE government has only a three-seat majority, which could evaporate as the coalition implements unpopular bail-out policies. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not think that the government will survive a full term.
Protests about labour market reforms, pension cuts, tax and social security increases, and privatisation are likely to intensify as the government strives to meet the ambitious primary surplus budget targets under the three-year European Stability Mechanism (ESM) bail-out programme. This will increase pressure on the coalition and is likely to result in an early election, which the main opposition, New Democracy (ND), would probably win.
We do not think that the policies contained in the third economic adjustment programme will generate sufficient economic growth to mitigate Greece's debt burden or reduce popular disaffection with austerity. Political stability and Greece's membership of the euro zone will therefore remain in question over the forecast period (2017-21).
We believe that Greece will leave the euro zone by the end of our forecast period, but it is impossible to pinpoint the timing of "Grexit" and build it into our forecast numbers. Grexit would be accompanied by a major debt default and would produce a severe recession for one or two years. After that the economy would grow at a rapid pace. Growth rates under this scenario would be faster than in our medium-term forecast.
We forecast annual real GDP growth in 2017 of 1%, following stagnant growth in 2016, as budget austerity holds back the economic recovery. We forecast average annual real GDP growth of 1.8% in 2018-21 (we have not built our medium-term Grexit forecast into these numbers). We expect that public debt will still equal almost 180% of GDP in 2021.
After zero inflation in 2016, we forecast average annual inflation of 1.4% in 2017-21, reflecting higher oil prices and a pick-up in domestic demand. These trends will result in widening current-account deficits in 2017-21, but these will remain moderate compared with the pre-crisis period.

Greece's score recovers modestly in 2017-21, from a low base, but its global ranking falls from 53rd to 59th and it remains at the bottom of the regional ranking. This is because of improvements in other countries' scores and despite improvement in the macroeconomic environment.
Country forecast overview: Greece's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Privatisation targets under the three-year European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme have not been met and a series of processes are being relaunched. The new privatisation fund makes sluggish progress.
2019-21: Efforts to valorise public property through concession management and long-leasehold development agreements.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: The investment incentives law, passed in June 2016, offers more tax relief and fewer direct subsidies. Its focus is predominantly small firms. Plans to cut down on bureaucracy make little progress.
2019-21: "Fast track" legislation will cover "strategic" investments in energy, tourism, transport, communications and health.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Capital controls introduced in June 2015 are eased gradually. The risk of Greece leaving the euro area and re-introducing exchange controls and (possibly) restrictions on trade remains high.
2019-21: There is a 60% risk of Greece leaving the euro area; factors on which this will depend include Greece's economic performance, the political and social sustainability of the reform package and the continuation of EU and IMF support.
Taxes
2017-18: Extensive efforts to widen the tax base. Government pledges to pursue aggressive tax collection, but implementation is tough. Indirect taxes increase. Mandatory introduction of electronic point of sale terminals helps.
2019-21: Little progress in cutting corporate income tax or value-added tax (VAT). Measures to tackle tax evasion stepped up, independence of the tax authority remains in doubt.
Financing
2017-18: Liquidity is tight. Uncertainty constrains lending capacity. Steps to reduce non-performing loans (NPLs) are painfully slow. The sale of NPL portfolios becomes a political bone of contention.
2019-21: Lending hampered by need to make provisions for still-high NPL portfolios. Moratorium on foreclosures is lifted for majority of debtors. Greece's main banks sell more of their overseas subsidiaries.
The labour market
2017-18: Labour market reform remains contentious for Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left. Unemployment remains high.
2019-21: EU-funded job-creation schemes, particularly for the young, raise employment but create few productive jobs.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Some projects under a development scheme co-financed by the EU for 2007-13 have shifted to the new 2014-20 period. First batch of projects concluded in 2017.
2019-21: Despite technical assistance from the EU, problems with absorption persist. Some privatisations are revived.

Background: After 400 years of Ottoman rule, Greece emerged as a sovereign state in 1830. A devastating civil war followed the retreat of German occupying forces in 1944. A military junta ruled the country from 1967 to 1974, but since then a demo-cracy has been in place. In 1981 Greece joined the European Economic Community, now the EU. It became a member of the economic and monetary union (EMU) in 2001, but it was granted undue leniency in complying with public finance conditions. Greece's rising debt has proved unsustainable and has put its continued membership of EMU in question.
Political structure: Greece is a parliamentary republic, with deputies elected for four-year terms. The prime minister and the government hold executive powers. The president is elected by the 300-member parliament for a five-year term. The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. Since the 2010 crisis the traditional party system has broken down. The parties that ruled Greece after the return of democracy in the mid-1970s-New Democracy (ND) and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok)-have been blamed by voters for causing the crisis and, subsequently, the painful consequences of being bailed out by the country's external creditors. The result has been political fragmentation and the rise of populist parties such as the left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), which came to power in 2015, and far-right parties such as the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (XA).
Policy issues: The ND-Pasok government of 2012-14, like its two predecessors, imposed draconian austerity packages. It also enacted fiscal and some structural economic reforms to meet the conditions of two EU-IMF bail-out packages totalling EUR240bn. Implementation proved difficult and ultimately brought down the government. After a seven-month confrontation with Greece's creditors the Syriza-led government negotiated a new three-year European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme. In 2012 public debt held by the private sector was restructured. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any further debt write-down. We assume that Greece will have to accept another ESM-financed bail-out programme in 2019-21.
Taxation: The tax rate on corporate profits is 29% and that on distributed dividends is 10%. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45% for income of more than EUR40,000. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at rates of 24%, 13% and 6%.
Foreign trade: In 2016 goods exports (fob) were worth US$27.1bn and imports (fob) came to US$45.4bn. The current account registered a deficit of US$1.2bn, equivalent to 0.6% of GDP.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
The coalition government of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is hanging on by a parliamentary majority of three. Following the September 2015 snap election, won by Mr Tsipras's party, Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), the prime minister formed another coalition with the right-wing, nationalist Independent Greeks (AE). The government obtained a five-seat majority in the 300-seat parliament, but this dropped to three after two members of parliament (MPs) resigned rather than support reforms under the three-year European Stability Mechanism (ESM, an inter-governmental assistance fund for countries in the euro zone) agreed in August 2015. The government has tied its acceptance of painful bail-out reforms in 2015-17 to a debt-relief deal and faces a political backlash at home having failed to achieve this at the latest Eurogroup meeting of euro zone finance ministers, on June 15th. It is questionable whether the government has the political will and capacity to implement all the measures required to complete the three-year ESM programme over the next 12 months. The risk of a breakdown in relations between the Greek authorities and their euro zone creditors over the coming year is high.
At the June 15th Eurogroup meeting agreement was reached on a package of structural measures to complete the second programme review. The outcome removed market uncertainty about Greece's capacity to make large debt repayments in July, as it paved the way for the ESM to approve on July 7th disbursement of EUR7.7bn to Greece, including EUR6.9bn to meet debt-service obligations. However, the meeting failed to meet the government's objective of attaining debt relief and left many critical questions unresolved, which means that uncertainty about the country's growth and debt trajectory is likely to persist, increasing political pressure on the government.
Greece has been under a bail-out programme since 2010. The economy has been in almost permanent recession since then, and real GDP has shrunk by more than a quarter. Unemployment is still at about 22% and youth unemploy-ment is near 50%. Despite undertaking the biggest post-crisis fiscal adjustment of any euro zone country, Greece's public finances remain parlous and its public debt is still close to 180% of GDP. The Economist Intelligence Unit thinks it more likely than not that Greece will leave the euro zone over the medium term. ESM fiscal and structural reform policies, to which Greece will remain subject after 2018, are unlikely to generate sufficient economic growth to mitigate Greece's debt burden or reduce popular disaffection. Doubts about the country's ability to stay in the euro zone will therefore persist.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
In the September 2015 election Syriza won 35.5% of the vote, slightly less than in January 2015, and secured 145 seats in Greece's 300-seat parliament (including the 50 bonus seats awarded to the winning party). The AE had ten MPs elected, and the two parties formed a coalition government with a slim majority. We do not think that the government will last a full term (to September 2019), given its fragile majority and the lack of political consensus on bail-out reforms. Syriza is trailing in the polls behind the opposition centre-right New Democracy (ND), but there is little popular enthusiasm for either party; many voters continue to blame ND for its role in leading Greece into the economic mess that led to the three bail-out programmes. However, ND is likely to win the next election and form a coalition government.
An amendment to the electoral law abolishes the 50-seat bonus for the party winning the most votes and lowers the voting age from 18 to 17. However, Syriza failed to secure the two-thirds majority required for the change to come into effect at the next election; therefore the law will take effect after the following election.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
We believe that Grexit is more likely than not by 2021, for several reasons.
Implementation risks. It will be difficult for the government to implement painful reforms in the face of opposition from vested interests and an austerity-weary population.
The growth/debt challenge. Even under a best-case reform scenario, it will be difficult for Greece to restore competitiveness and achieve significant growth while remaining inside the euro zone. The economy's lack of competitiveness, which is difficult to address without a currency devaluation, will continue to shackle growth. Structural reforms recommended in the bail-out programme are slow burners that are unlikely to deliver growth in the short term. Mean-while, spending cuts and tax increases will prolong the squeeze on domestic demand and hinder growth. Without a write-down, which Germany will not countenance, the debt burden will depress economic activity for decades.
Increasing Euroscepticism. According to recent opinion polls, popular support for staying in the euro zone is waning, although a majority still supports membership. In the coming years support for remaining in the euro zone at all costs is likely to diminish.
Greek-Turkish relations have deteriorated recently, with a rise in tensions owing mainly to two issues.
First, Turkey requested the extradition of eight Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece on the night of the failed coup on July 15th 2016. Greece's Supreme Court rejected the request, saying that the soldiers could not be guaranteed a fair trial. In response, Turkey called the ruling "political" and sent two navy vessels to the disputed islands of Kardak in the Aegean Sea, prompting Greece to warn Turkey against violating its territorial waters.
Second, as part of negotiations regarding the division of Cyprus, Turkey insists that its troops should be kept on the island, whereas Greece and Greek Cypriots are adamantly opposed. Talks all but collapsed in July over this issue.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
Greece's latest bail-out programme will shape economic policy to 2018 and beyond. The ESM is providing financial assistance to meet Greece's financing needs, which euro zone leaders have estimated at EUR86bn over three years (2015-18). In return Greece must implement fiscal and structural reforms, as well as large-scale asset sales. On July 7th the ESM authorised the disbursement of EUR7.7bn to Greece, bringing the total disbursement so far under the third economic adjustment programme to EUR39.4bn. It will be followed by another sub-tranche of EUR800m after September 1st, subject to the ESM being satisfied that the government has made progress in clearing its arrears to the private sector. That will be the concluding payment of the second programme review.
As we expected, there was no agreement on debt relief at the Eurogroup on June 15th, although there was further discussion of what type of measures might be considered at the end of the current ESM programme. The IMF is not convinced that the measures would be sufficient to make Greece's debt sustainable. The IMF says that it cannot officially support the programme by providing funding unless it is confident that the debt is sustainable. When a country's sovereign debt is assessed as being unsustain-able the IMF's legal framework prevents it from providing financial support, unless the programme includes specific measures-normally including debt restructuring-that can resolve the debt-sustainability problem within a medium-term timeframe.
In May 2016 the European institutions and the IMF agreed on a framework for assessing debt sustainability based on the view that Greece's gross financing needs should remain below 15% of GDP after the end of the programme in 2018 for the medium term and below 20% of GDP thereafter. On that occasion the Eurogroup said that it would "implement a possible second set of measures following the successful implementation of the ESM programme".
On July 27th the IMF executive board will decide whether to support Greece with a precautionary stand-by arrangement (SBA), withholding funding until after agreement is reached on measures to ensure long-term debt sustainability for Greece. Despite attempts to suggest that the IMF is on board, it seems fairly clear that it is not and that it is no longer prepared to pretend otherwise.
The European Central Bank (ECB) said that euro zone finance ministers had not provided enough clarity on debt relief to reassure the bank that Greece's debt was sustainable, so Greece will not be included in the ECB's bond-buying quantitative easing (QE) programme. There must therefore be some doubt about Greece's ability to return to the international capital markets and exit the drip-feed of bail-out programme financing after 2018.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
Eurostat has confirmed budget data released by the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT, the national statistics office) showing that in 2016 Greece achieved a general government budget surplus of EUR1.3bn, equivalent to 0.7% of GDP (ESA 2010 measure). The budget recorded a primary surplus (budget balance minus interest payments) of EUR6.9bn, equivalent to 3.95% of GDP. The above-plan performance was primarily the result of expenditure cuts, which fell by 9.6% year on year, to 49.1%, from 54.3% of GDP in 2015. Revenue increased by 3.1% year on year, to EUR87.5bn.
In 2017 the primary surplus target under the third economic adjustment programme is 1.75% of GDP; this rises to 3.5% in 2018 and for four years until 2022 (after which Greece is expected to deliver a 2% of GDP budget primary surplus until 2060). The 2017 budget targets additional revenue of more than EUR1bn from new (mainly indirect) taxes and spending cuts of more than EUR1bn. The budget assumes real GDP growth of 2.7% in 2017, which is faster than our forecast of 1%. The government target seems optimistic given the likely dampening effect on domestic demand of further tax increases and austerity, and the negative effect on confidence resulting from the delay in finalising the second review. First-quarter data show that the budget is being kept under control by cutting expenditure. We do not see Greece meeting, from 2018 onwards, annual primary surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP for five years.
The restructuring of government debt to the private sector cut the debt/GDP ratio to 159.5% at end-2012, from 172% in 2011. However, the budget over-performance in 2016 was not sufficient to arrest the growth of gross consolidated government debt, which rose to EUR314.9bn, equivalent to 179.4% of GDP (up from 177.7% in 2015). Government debt is now almost entirely owed to official creditors. We expect that, without a debt write-down and assuming weak nominal GDP growth rates over the medium term, the public debt/GDP ratio will remain close to 180% in 2021.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
The ECB is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero; a series of so-called targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) aimed at pushing banks to lend more money; and a EUR60bn per month QE programme, which will run until the end of 2017. However, the economic recovery in the euro zone has maintained momentum-supported by an acceleration in credit growth-and looks to be more broad based. We expect another healthy expansion of real GDP in the euro zone in 2017, of 1.8%, after growth of 1.8% on average in 2015-16. Commentary at the end of June from the ECB's president, Mario Draghi, that mentioned "reflationary" forces in the region's economy has reinforced our forecast that the bank will begin to wind down, or "taper", the programme in 2018. Nevertheless, underlying price pressure remains relatively subdued, and downside risks to wage growth and the global economy during that year could yet slow the pace at which the ECB reduces its monthly asset purchases. We maintain our forecast that the ECB will not raise policy rates before the end of our forecast period, in 2021.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Real GDP data released by ELSTAT indicate that the economy stagnated in 2016. Broken down by expenditure, the only positive contribution for full-year 2016 came from final consumption, which rose by 0.6%. However, this headline figure masked significant differences in the underlying numbers. Household consumption rose by 1.4%, and general government spending fell by 2.1%. Exports of goods and services contracted, and fixed investment stagnated.
On June 2nd ELSTAT released its revised estimate for the first quarter of 2017. Real GDP (seasonally and calendar adjusted) grew by 0.4% compared with both the previous quarter and the year-earlier period. There appear to be contradictory trends at work in the Greek economy that make it difficult to forecast short-term growth prospects. Delays in finalising the second programme review had a negative effect on consumer and investor confidence in the first half of 2017. However, there was evidence of consumers stepping up discretionary spending as fears mounted about the outcome of the negotiations between Greece and its creditors, supporting retail sales. Meanwhile, working-day-adjusted industrial output averaged about 7% in the first five months of 2017, and export growth has been fairly brisk; investment also appears to have picked up, but this is also driving up imports. On the downside, a combination of more and higher taxes, higher social security payments, debt repayments and spending cuts will put pressure on household disposable income. Credit growth has been sharply negative so far this year, and there is little prospect of a resumption of lending growth any time soon. We forecast real GDP growth of 1% in 2017.
As the threat of a bail-out breakdown and default recedes and the authorities make some progress in structural reform and privatisation, we expect investment growth to return and household consumption to increase modestly, by an average of 4% and 1.7% per year respectively in 2018-21. However, some of the headwinds discussed above will persist in 2018 and beyond, when the government is supposed to deliver an annual primary budget surplus of 3.5% of GDP. Given the bail-out programme's emphasis on fiscal restraint and meeting ambitious primary surplus targets, as well as still high unemployment and limited lending growth, we believe that annual real GDP growth in 2018-21 will average 1.8%. Government consumption growth will remain modest in 2018-21, given that Greece's international creditors will insist on continued fiscal consolidation.
We expect investment to recover in 2017-21, after almost a decade of contraction, but this will be from a low base (65% below 2007 levels in 2016). The decline in fixed investment since the start of the sovereign debt crisis will have a significant negative effect over the longer term, undermining the economy's ability to generate growth. Greece's external trade will be constrained by the continuation of the capital controls regime, as well as by its relatively uncompetitive goods exports. After a strong second-half export performance in 2016 base effects will reverse this pattern in 2017. Over the medium term we expect tourism to support services export growth, but we forecast only modest growth of exports of goods and services, averaging 2.3% per year in 2017-21.
We forecast that Greece will leave the euro zone by 2021, but it is impossible to pinpoint the timing and build it into our forecast. Grexit would lead to a sovereign default and a severe recession in the first few years, but the economy would then begin to grow rapidly, assuming a responsible fiscal policy guided by the need to achieve a primary surplus. Growth rates under this scenario would be faster than those in our medium-term forecast.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
In January-May Greece's harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) rose by an average of 1.6% year on year. As in recent months, the main positive contribution came from transport prices, which rose by 4% year on year, adding 0.6 percentage points to headline price growth. Transport prices are heavily linked to energy costs, and with global energy prices having bottomed in early 2016, base effects will now become less supportive. We expect the energy-driven spike in inflation to fade, and, with core inflation still weak, we forecast an average increase in the HICP of 1.3% this year and average annual inflation of 1.4% in 2018-21.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
The euro has moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1 since mid-2015. The annual average exchange rate was US$1.11:EUR1 in 2016, although a sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following the presidential election in the US led to a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1. The euro has since rallied as the region's economic recovery has continued and political risk has waned. This, combined with a rise in expectations of QE tapering by the ECB, has raised the upside risks to our forecast for the exchange rate to average US$1.08:EUR1 in 2017-18. We expect the euro to appreciate gradually thereafter.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
In 2016 the current account recorded a deficit of US$1.2bn (0.6% of GDP) compared with a small surplus in 2015, as a result of a deterioration in the services surplus. After several years during which it contracted fairly sharply, the current-account deficit has started to expand modestly, according to recent data, reflecting primarily developments on the merchandise goods account and in particular higher prices for energy imports. We expect this trend to continue and expect the external deficit to widen moderately relative to GDP this year. We forecast that annual deficits will expand further as import prices continue to rise and import volumes gradually pick up in line with higher domestic demand, although they will be smaller than the average annual deficit of 7.5% of GDP since Greece joined the euro in 2001.

Abstract: Under the AKP, Turkey is moving towards a presidential system of government, which will come into effect by late 2019, and possibly earlier. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved. The bank has raised most of its main policy rates since November 2016 and has increasingly provided funding to the banking sector at its previously little used "late liquidity window" overnight lending rate, which was gradually raised by a total of 250 basis points, to 12.25%, in late April. Since November 2016 the weighted average cost of the central bank's funds to the banking system has risen, from 7.8% to about 12% in early July 2017. 2012a 2013a 2014a 2015a 2016b 2017c 2018c 2019c 2020c 2021c The labour market (av) Labour force (m) 26.1 27.0 28.8 29.7 30.5 31.5 32.2 32.7 33.5 34.2 Labour force (% change) 2.1 3.5 6.4 3.1 3.0 3.2 2.3 1.5 2.5 2.0 Employment (m) 23.9 24.6 25.9 26.6 27.2 27.9 28.6 29.1 29.8 30.6 Employment (% change) 2.9 2.8 5.4 2.7 2.2 2.5 2.4 2.0 2.3 2.5 Unemployment (m) 2.2 2.4 2.9 3.0 3.3 3.6 3.7 3.6 3.7 3.7 Unemployment rate (%) 8.5 9.1 10.0 10.3 10.9 11.5 11.4 11.0 11.1 10.7 Wage and price inflation (% except labour costs per hour) Consumer prices (av) 8.9 7.5 8.9 7.7 7.8a 10.3 7.8 6.3 5.7 5.2 Consumer prices (year-end) 6.3 7.5 8.3 8.9 8.5a 8.6 7.8 6.0 5.3 5.0 Producer prices (av) 6.1 4.5 10.2 5.3 4.3a 14.8 9.5 8.5 7.5 5.5 GDP deflator (av) 7.4 6.3 7.4 7.8 7.7a 8.8 8.2 6.1 6.1 5.7 Private consumption deflator (av) 7.8 6.1 7.7 7.7 6.7a 10.3 8.9 7.3 6.8 6.2 Government consumption deflator (av) 9.3 6.0 9.4 8.2 9.8a 9.4 7.8 6.3 5.7 5.2 Fixed investment deflator (av) 6.6 5.8 9.0 7.6 7.7a 6.0 5.5 5.0 5.0 5.0 Average nominal wages 15.6b 14.4b 15.5b 13.7b 15.9 11.5 10.0 9.0 8.3 7.7 Average real wages 6.1b 6.5b 6.1b 5.6b 7.5 1.1 2.0 2.6 2.4 2.4 Unit labour costs (TL-based; av)d 15.9b 10.9b 18.2b 12.7b 17.6 12.0 10.8 9.5 8.8 8.7 Unit labour costs (US$-based)d 8.1b 4.7b 2.8b -9.3b 5.9 -6.9 8.9 5.2 5.5 6.2 Labour costs per hour (TL)d 7.5b 8.6b 10.0b 11.3b 13.1 14.6 16.1 17.5 19.0 20.5 Labour costs per hour (US$) 4.2b 4.5b 4.5b 4.2b 4.3 4.0 4.3 4.6 4.8 5.0 a Actual.b Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.c Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts.d Manufacturing only: public and private sectors.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The political instability in Turkey that followed the failed coup in July 2016 has eased partially since the approval in a referendum in April 2017 of a set of constitutional changes designed to replace Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidency. However, the presidential reform provides few checks and balances on the powers of the president and moves the country closer to one-man rule by the incumbent, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. This will further undermine Turkey's already fragile democratic institutions and governance structures, exacerbate the deep social and political divisions in the country, damage the country's already fragile international relations, especially with the EU, and delay further economic reform efforts.
The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast is that Mr Erdogan and the Justice and Development Party (AKP) will win the next presidential and parliamentary elections, completing the transfer of executive powers to Mr Erdogan. The elections are not due to be held until late 2019, but they could be called earlier-once the institutions and instruments of the new presidential system are in place-if Mr Erdogan decides to accelerate the transfer of executive powers to the presidency. Emergency rule, which was introduced following the failed coup, will continue to be used to silence government critics and disable the pro-Kurdish opposition. We expect emergency rule to remain in place for the foreseeable future to allow Mr Erdogan to govern as a president with executive powers until the new system of government is fully in place.
Turkey is vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and jihadi extremists affiliated with Islamic State (IS). Turkey risks be-coming mired in the Syrian conflict, following the deployment of Turkish troops to Syria to combat IS and halt the territorial expansion by Syrian Kurds.
The current direction of policy appears to be towards a difficult balancing act between fiscal loosening and tight monetary policy while encouraging banks to lend to households and businesses. Political pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey to cut interest rates to boost the economy has eased. We expect the bank to keep monetary policy tight in order to lower inflation and prevent a further depreciation of the lira amid expectations of higher US interest rates.
We expect average annual real GDP growth to accelerate, from 3% in 2016 to an annual average rate of 4.1% in 2017-21. The current-account deficit has narrowed, but will still be large at an annual average of about 4% of GDP in 2017-21 and therefore difficult to fund, especially if global liquidity is tightened.

Our business environment score for Turkey deteriorates slightly in the forecast period (2017-21) and the country's global ranking falls by 12 places, reflecting the absence of reforms in recent years. Turkey lags most central and east European countries for foreign direct investment. The main shortcomings are a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Privatisations are likely to be delayed amid the post-coup upheaval in the state institutions. Some companies, notably those with media holdings or ties with the Gulenist movement, remain subject to heavy-handed state intervention.
2019-21: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in a wide range of sectors, although the opening-up of the energy market makes progress.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2019-21: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Capital controls are not considered. There is a boost to trade following the lifting of Russian sanctions. Possible increase in protectionism under the new US administration.
2019-21: Customs union with the EU could be extended, but negotiations are likely to be protracted given the deterioration in Turkish-EU relations. More free-trade agreements may come into force with the EU's trading partners.
Taxes
2017-18: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make some progress. Tax rates are largely unchanged.
2019-21: A broader income tax base as exemptions and exceptions are reduced. Possible tax cuts and increased incentives.
Financing
2017-18: Monetary policy remains cautious amid concern about a possible deterioration in credit quality. Political pressure on c0mmercial banks to reduce interest rates. Renewed pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey cannot be ruled out.
2019-21: The banking system remains stable, despite some weaknesses. Heavy reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2017-18: Labour market remains rigid, with relatively high costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment. Wage moderation after 30% minimum wage rise in 2016. Obstacles to employing foreigners ease.
2019-21: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Progress, albeit slow, continues on investment plans in energy, transport and communications.
2019-21: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. The construction of major airport and urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks could persist.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West, becoming a member of the Council of Europe (1949) and NATO (1952), and signing an association agreement with the then European Community (1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but the coup at-tempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey has a unicameral parliamentary system of government with parliament elected for a four-year term. To win seats parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Under the AKP, Turkey is moving towards a presidential system of government, which will come into effect by late 2019, and possibly earlier. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability is Turkey's biggest policy challenge. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and changing global liquidity conditions will require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy relatively tight to attract adequate capital inflows. The Kurdish problem, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is one of Turkey's most pressing political issues, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015 and there has been a resurgence in violence. The failed coup highlighted long-standing institutional weaknesses, which, with the AKP's consent until 2013, allowed the secretive Gulenist movement to infiltrate the state. Further politicisation of the judiciary is likely after the coup attempt. Corruption and patronage remain widespread.
Taxation: The basic rate of corporation tax is 20%. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Tax reform to reduce evasion was one of the main elements of previous IMF reform programmes but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2016 goods exports (fob) came to US$150.2bn and imports (fob) to US$191bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$40.9bn-a contraction from US$48.1bn in 2015. The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
The intense political instability that followed the failed coup by parts of the military in July 2016 has eased partially since the approval in a referendum in April 2017 of a set of constitutional changes designed to replace Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidency. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit maintains its negative medium-term political outlook. The narrow referendum victory and allegations of vote fraud have deepened the social and political divisions. The "justice march" from the capital, Ankara, to Istanbul, led by Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), ended peacefully on July 9th, but further protests are likely, keeping high the risk of clashes between protesters and pro-government supporters or a government clampdown. The presidential reform, which will take effect after the next presidential and parliamentary elections, both due in 2019, will further undermine Turkey's fragile democratic institutions and governance structures. It provides few checks and balances on the powers of the president and moves the country closer to one-man rule by the incum-bent president and leader of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Mr Erdogan and the AKP have continued to tighten their grip on power. The state of emergency law introduced after the failed coup has been repeatedly extended on a three-month basis. We expect it remain in place for the foresee-able future because it will effectively allow Mr Erdogan to govern as a president with executive powers until the new system of government is fully in place.
Emergency rule was initially introduced to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. However, the use of these powers has been extended to eliminate the pro-Kurdish political opposition, which the government accuses of having links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). More than 100,000 people-mainly in the judiciary, the military, the police, academic institutions and the media-have so far been suspended, dismissed or detained.
Security risk remains high, with negative implications for the economy. The state is seeking to end an insurgency by the PKK in the south-east of Turkey, address the domestic security risk posed by terrorist attacks by Kurdish militants and Islamic State (IS) in cities across the country, and implement military operations in Syria and Iraq against both IS and the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds. The purge of the Turkish armed forces and the police since the attempted coup has created operational capacity problems and contributed to intelligence failures that have exacerbated Turkey's domestic security issues. In the short to medium term neither the government nor the PKK appears to be interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will intensify.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
The next parliamentary and presidential elections are due to be held in 2019, but they could be called earlier if Mr Erdogan decides to accelerate the transfer of executive powers to the presidency once the institutions and instruments of the new presidential system are in place. Given the popularity of the president and his party's ability to control the election process, we expect Mr Erdogan to win the presidential election and to remain in office with enhanced powers for at least one more five-year term, if not two (the maximum allowed), up to 2029. His popularity is unrivalled, and the opposition is fragmented and currently appears to have no candidates capable of challenging him. In 2014 Mr Erdogan won the presidential election in the first round with just over 50% of the vote against a joint candidate presented by the CHP and the right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP). The MHP's support in parliament for the presidential reform makes it unlikely that either of the two parties will consider fielding a joint candidate at the next election.
The clampdown on the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) since mid-2015, the MHP leadership's decision to back the presidential reform, and the hardline nationalist stance adopted by Mr Erdogan and the AKP could have a considerable effect on voting patterns at the next parliamentary election. Both the MHP and the HDP have been weakened since the 2015 elections and run the risk of falling below the high 10% national vote threshold for parliamentary representation, which would boost the AKP's seat share. Under the constitutional changes approved in the referendum, there will be 600 seats in a much weakened parliament from the next election, up from 550 currently.
The next local elections are scheduled to take place by March 2019.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Since the failed coup Turkish foreign policy has been heavily conditioned by Mr Erdogan's domestic political goals, notably his push to establish a presidential system of government. This approach, combined with ongoing political upheaval in Europe and the US, has resulted in a marked deterioration in Turkey's inter-national relations with its traditional Western allies.
Having deployed armed forces to back rebel groups in Syria to fight IS and prevent the expansion of territory held by US-backed, PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurds, Turkey risks becoming embroiled in the conflict. Tensions and the risk of confrontation between Turkey and US-backed forces could escalate once IS is defeated. The US administration appears unlikely to grant Turkey's request for Mr Gulen to be extradited from the US to face trial in Turkey on charges of masterminding the failed coup. Even if the AKP government provides evidence of his role in the coup that would stand up in a US court, there would be a strong chance that his extradition would be rejected on the grounds that he might not get a fair trial in Turkey.
Despite talk of agreeing a new roadmap to ease tensions and improve co-operation in the main areas of interest such as security, trade and investment, neither Turkey nor the EU is genuinely interested in Turkish membership of the bloc anymore. However, neither has yet been willing to suspend negotiations unilaterally. If Turkey reintroduces the death penalty, as Mr Erdogan has suggested, the EU may not be able to avoid suspending the process. The sus-pension of accession negotiations would almost certainly prompt Turkey to end its collaboration with the EU to stem the movement of migrants and refugees into Europe. A settlement of the de facto division of Cyprus between the Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north could help to improve Turkey's relations with the EU, but talks collapsed in July 2017. We maintain our forecast that a settlement is unlikely during the forecast period (2017-21).
Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved. Russia has lifted almost all sanctions, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly in relation to the conflict in Syria, where both are militarily involved but are pursuing contrasting goals. We expect relations to remain largely transactional, and the risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
Turkey's economy has shown resilience during past bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing largely to the country's solid public finances, well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector and its dynamic, diver-sified private business sector. However, the risk of an intensification of political instability and fluctuations in global liquidity could disrupt foreign capital inflows to Turkey during the forecast period. These inflows are needed to meet the country's large external financing requirements, but tend to be short term and highly volatile. Faltering capital inflows put the lira under intense pressure in late 2016 and early 2017, fuelling an acceleration in inflation that prompted the Central Bank of Turkey to start tightening monetary policy in November after a prolonged period of loosening. If the lira depreciates sharply again-after stabilising at about TL3.5:US$1 in June 2017, it fell by around 3% in the first week of July, to TL3.63:US$1, probably prompted by expectations of balance sheet tapering by the Federal Reserve (the Fed, the US central bank)-an abrupt tightening of policy may be necessary, which could strangle Turkey's economic recovery. However, this is not our baseline scenario, as we currently expect US monetary policy to be tightened only gradually in the remainder of 2017-18.
Uncertainty about the direction of Turkey's economic policy continues to cloud the country's medium-term economic outlook. The government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges have blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. The current direction of policy appears to be towards a difficult balancing act between fiscal loosening and tight monetary policy while encouraging banks to lend to households and businesses.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios-reflecting the impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past and major upward revisions to Turkey's national accounts-give the government some leeway to loosen fiscal policy to support the economy. Our baseline forecast remains that fiscal policy will be kept relatively tight to support investor confidence and prevent a surge in domestic demand causing an unsustainable widening of the current-account deficit. Nevertheless, we expect the central government deficit, which captures most of the public sector, will widen from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to an average of 2.3% of GDP per year in 2017-19, before narrowing to 1.9% in 2021. Although the government debt/GDP ratio has edged up slightly, to 29.4% in 2016, we expect it to remain around 30% in 2017-21. The risk of a larger deterio-ration in the public finances cannot be ruled out. The transfer of Turkey's major state assets to a sovereign wealth fund established in 2016 to help finance major infrastructure projects could bring privatisation to a halt and the fund could become a vehicle to increase off-budget spending.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
Political pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey to lower interest rates to revive economic activity has eased, as the government has switched its attention to Turkey's profitable commercial banks. We expect that the central bank will have to keep its monetary policy tight in the remainder of 2017 and in 2018 in order to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent a further depreciation of the lira amid expectations of higher US interest rates and Fed balance sheet tapering. To do this, we expect the Turkish central bank to use a mix of interest-rate rises, macroprudential measures and other policies. The bank has raised most of its main policy rates since November 2016 and has increasingly provided funding to the banking sector at its previously little used "late liquidity window" overnight lending rate, which was gradually raised by a total of 250 basis points, to 12.25%, in late April. Since November 2016 the weighted average cost of the central bank's funds to the banking system has risen, from 7.8% to about 12% in early July 2017.
The central bank is seeking gradually to normalise its monetary policy frame-work to establish a single policy interest rate, the one-week repurchase lending rate, which would help to improve transparency regarding monetary policy decisions. However, it is unlikely that the corridor will be eliminated until inflation is more firmly on a downward path towards its medium-term target of 5% and domestic political uncertainty eases. From 2017 the bank will hold only eight regular Monetary Policy Committee meetings annually rather than 12.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
After slowing sharply in 2016, real GDP growth has rebounded. We expect it to accelerate from 3% in 2016 to 4.1% per year in 2017-18 (revised up from 3.3% previously), supported by government stimulus measures, an easing of domestic political uncertainty after the presidential reform referendum and a pick-up in global demand. We forecast annual average growth of 4% in 2019-21. This assumes that domestic political conditions do not deteriorate sharply in the next few years as the country transitions to a presidential system of government and that foreign investor confidence in Turkey holds up. The main risks to growth over the medium term are that further domestic political uncertainty and tighter global liquidity will negatively affect capital inflows, hampering bank lending and business confidence.
We expect real private consumption growth to accelerate from 2.3% in 2016 to an annual average of 3.5% in 2017-21 owing to a moderate improvement in con-fidence, an easing of lending conditions as a result of government pressure to lower interest rates, a gradual recovery in employment growth and government incentives for the purchase of certain household durable goods in the short term (at least until September 2017).
After expanding by 7.6% in 2016 we expect government spending to increase by nearly 8% per year on average in 2017-19 as the government seeks to revive the economy and boost support ahead of the 2019 elections. From 2020 we expect growth to be more moderate but still solid.
The deterioration in the business environment since the attempted coup will continue to dampen fixed investment growth in 2017-18, as a more cautious approach by businesses will offset government plans to invest heavily in infrastructure projects. In 2019-21 we forecast an acceleration to average annual growth of 5%, assuming a less volatile domestic and global environment.
We expect the lifting of Russian sanctions on Turkey since mid-2016, the positive impact of a weaker lira on export competitiveness and stronger growth in the main export markets, especially in Europe, to drive a return to growth of exports of goods and services in 2017-21. However, we expect the perception of security risks to persist for some time, which will continue to deter some visitors to Turkey and weigh on the tourist sector. Our expectation is that a sharp slowdown in the Chinese economy in 2018 and a cyclical downturn in the US in 2019 will dampen external demand growth in those years.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
Consumer price inflation has remained stubbornly high-well above the official 5% medium-term target-as a weaker lira has, for the most part, offset the disinflationary effects of plunging global oil prices since mid-2014. We expect further currency weakness and a moderate recovery in oil and other commodity prices from 2017 to keep consumer price inflation well above the official target during the first half of the forecast period. Assuming that the central bank keeps monetary policy tight and does not loosen it too soon, we see inflation gradually easing, achieving the 5% target by end-2021.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
Amid further bouts of volatility, we expect the lira to depreciate against the US dollar to an annual average of TL3.63:US$1 in 2017-a fall of about 17% compared with 2016. In 2018-21 we forecast that the exchange rate will remain broadly stable in real terms, depreciating in nominal terms to an average of TL4.06:US$1 in 2021. The lira will also depreciate sharply against the euro in 2017-21. There are substantial risks to our exchange-rate forecast, arising from uncertainty about the outlook for global financial flows, and the impact on investor confidence of domestic political instability and geopolitical turmoil in the region surrounding Turkey.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
After narrowing in recent years, we expect the current account to widen moderately and remain sufficiently large-at a forecast average of 4.1% of GDP per year in 2017-21-to make it difficult for Turkey to meet its external financing needs if global liquidity is constrained and investor confidence deteriorates. Although a weaker lira and the lifting of Russian sanctions will boost Turkey's main export sectors, we expect this to be largely offset by the moderately higher cost of imported energy and inputs for manufactured import-intensive exports. There has been a rebound in Russian tourist arrivals in early 2017, but the tour-ism sector is likely to take several years to recover to 2015 pre-crisis levels, before the resurgence of terrorist attacks and the imposition of Russian sanctions.

Abstract: [...]the country remains in 12th place in the regional ranking but loses two places in the global ranking, dropping to 19th. [...]The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the election to be a three-horse race between the ÖVP, the SPÖ and the FPÖ, with the ÖVP currently best placed to emerge as the largest party in the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house of parliament). [...]we expect growth to accelerate to an upwardly revised 1.9% this year, broadly in line with that of regional peers. 2012a 2013a 2014a 2015a 2016a 2017b 2018b 2019b 2020b 2021b The labour market (av) Labour force (m) 3.7 3.8 3.8 3.9 3.9 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 Labour force (% change) 1.6 1.2 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.3 0.9 0.3 0.0 -0.1 Employment (m) 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.6 3.6 3.7 3.7 3.7 3.8 Employment (% change) 1.3 0.5 0.6 0.9 1.5 1.8 1.2 0.9 0.6 0.5 Unemployment (m) 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 Unemployment rate (av; %; national measure) 7.0 7.6 8.4 9.1 9.1 8.6 8.3 7.8 7.3 6.8 Unemployment rate (av; %; EU/OECD standardised measure) 4.9 5.3 5.6 5.7 6.0 5.6 5.4 5.1 4.8 4.6 Wage and price inflation (% except labour costs per hour) GDP deflator 2.0 1.6 1.8 1.9 1.3 2.4 1.6 1.2 1.6 1.8 Consumer prices (av; EU harmonised measure) 2.6 2.1 1.5 0.8 1.0 2.2 1.6 2.0 2.1 2.1 Producer prices (av) 2.4 -1.1 -2.0 -3.6 -2.4 2.5 2.2 2.7 3.0 2.8 GDP deflator (av) 2.0 1.6 1.8 1.9 1.3 2.4 1.6 1.2 1.6 1.8 Private consumption deflator (av) 2.4 2.2 2.1 1.4 1.3 2.0 1.4 1.8 1.8 1.9 Government consumption deflator (av) 2.4 1.2 1.5 1.6 1.5 2.5 1.6 2.0 2.1 2.1 Fixed investment deflator (av) 2.2 1.6 1.5 1.6 1.0 1.2 1.5 1.8 1.7 1.7 Average nominal wages 3.3 2.6 2.4 2.2 1.6 1.5 1.9 2.5 2.6 2.7 Average real wages 0.7 0.5 0.9 1.3 0.6 -0.6 0.3 0.5 0.5 0.6 Unit labour costs ([euro]-based; av) 2.6 1.0 0.4 0.5 -0.3 -0.4 -0.3 0.2 -0.1 0.0 Unit labour costs (US$-based) -5.2 4.3 0.5 -16.1 -0.6 -2.4 -0.4 2.7 1.5 2.0 Labour costs per hour ([euro]) 32.3 33.1 34.0 34.8 35.4 36.0 36.8 37.8 38.9 40.0 Labour costs per hour (US$) 41.5 44.0 45.2 38.6 39.2 39.0 39.8 42.0 43.8 46.0 a Actual.b Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The grand coalition of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) fell apart in May 2017 following the resignation of the ÖVP. An early election will be held on October 15th.
The popularity of the new leader of the ÖVP, the young minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, means that the election has become a three-horse race between the SPÖ, the ÖVP and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). The most likely coalition to emerge is one that is led by the ÖVP and includes the FPÖ, although negotiations to form one could be fraught.
The inclusion of the FPÖ in the government will not lead to similar EU sanctions as in 2000, when the party was last part of a coalition, owing largely to the normalisation of the far right in Europe since then.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects any new government to focus on integration and immigration policy, and to attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and introduce some additional flexibility in labour and product markets. However, limited government cohesion is likely to lead to limited progress.
The government budget is forecast to remain in deficit, albeit well within the EU-mandated limit of 3% of GDP, throughout the forecast period (2017-21) as the fiscal consolidation process suffers under limited government cohesion and effectiveness. Nevertheless, the public debt/GDP ratio will fall gradually.
After several years of underperformance compared with its regional peers, the economy has performed relatively strongly since the start of 2016, growing by 1.6% in 2016 and 1.9% year on year in the first quarter of 2017. We forecast continued catch-up growth this year, at 1.9%, and that growth will moderate to 1.4% on average in 2018-21. In line with the broader recovery in the euro zone, this will be driven mainly by domestic demand.
Consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) will continue to exceed the euro zone average in 2017-21, driven by structural domestic factors including higher unit wage costs and more regulated markets. Annual inflation averaged 1% in 2016, up from 0.8% in 2015, and we forecast an annual average of 2% in 2017-21.
In 2016 the current-account surplus decreased slightly, to 1.7% of GDP. We forecast that it will average about 2% in the coming years as a weakening trade balance is offset by strong tourism receipts.

Austria's business environment score improves slightly between the historical period (2012-16) and the forecast period (2017-21). As a result, the country remains in 12th place in the regional ranking but loses two places in the global ranking, dropping to 19th. Austria's strengths as a business location include decent infrastructure, stable institutions and co-operative labour relations, but high taxes, limited market opportunities and restrictive regulations will persist.
Country forecast overview: Austria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Government works on reducing red tape, but progress likely to be limited.
2019-21: Modest strengthening of competition authority's powers. Administrative reform reduces red tape. More transparency in antitrust proceedings. Risk of political interference in private firms in which state owns substantial stakes.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Foreign investment is generally welcome, but underlying opposition to takeovers of "national champions" persists.
2019-21: Possible erosion of barriers against foreign takeovers as a result of commercial pressure and EU legislation.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: No exchange controls. Foreign trade, governed by EU rules, should remain liberal.
2019-21: EU likely to accelerate shift towards bilateral free-trade agreements as multilateral trade negotiations stagnate. Little progress on EU-US trade deal. Free-trade agreement between the EU and the UK.
Taxes
2017-18: No significant changes to the tax system, owing in part to a likely deterioration in government effectiveness.
2019-21: Some tax reform is likely assuming a government including the Freedom Party (FPÖ) takes power in 2017. Vested interests will continue to hamper large-scale reform, and the high tax burden will remain.
Financing
2017-18: Financial stability to improve amid tighter regulatory requirements and a reduction in risk from exposure to central and eastern Europe. Credit conditions ease gradually as banks' profitability recovers.
2019-21: Introduction of systemic risk buffer of banks' risk-weighted assets. Further uptake in corporate bond issuance.
The labour market
2017-18: Economy-wide minimum wage introduced. More stringent requirements for early retirement and invalidity pensions. Labour market slowly improves as increase in labour supply moderates and unemployment starts to drop.
2019-21: Continued expansion of labour supply, primarily via net immigration, but concerns about shortage of skilled employees in certain sectors are likely to persist. Early retirement phased out.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Further take-up of broadband services. Gradual improvement of transport links with eastern Europe.
2019-21: Improved transport network connecting main urban centres and providing better access to the country's interior. Gradual transition to low-carbon economy entails significant changes to electricity transmission infrastructure.

Background: Austria became an important force in central Europe with the formation of the Habsburg empire in the 15th century and remained so until the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the first world war. The Republic of Austria emerged in 1918. In 1938 Austria was incorporated into the German Third Reich. With the departure of the victorious Allied forces in 1955, it regained independence as a neutral country. In the post-war period Austria took great strides to catch up economically with the rest of the developed world and is now one of the most advanced nations. It is a member of the EU and a participant in the economic and monetary union (EMU).
Political structure: Austria is a federal republic and the head of state is the federal president. The government is led by the federal chancellor. The national parliament has two houses: the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house), of 62 members appointed by state parliaments, and the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house), which has 183 members elected by proportional representation. An early general election will be held on October 15th 2017.
Policy issues: The government's stated priorities are to reduce the budget deficit and debt pile, improve labour market participation rates, strengthen competitiveness, increase expenditure on research and development, continue to reform healthcare expenditure, stabilise the financial sector and raise educational standards. Progress on these issues will be modest at best, as tensions surrounding immigration, security and border controls will remain elevated across Europe, diverting attention to security and migration-related policy areas.
Taxation: According to the European Commission, Austrian labour tax as a percentage of GDP is the second highest in the EU. A 2016 tax reform lowered the tax burden for low- and middle-income earners, but raised the top personal income tax rate from 50% to 55%. Social security contributions, shared between employers and employees, are high. Corporation tax is levied at a rate of 25%. Dividend and investment income is subject to a withholding tax of 27.5%. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a standard rate of 20%, and a reduced rate of 13% (raised from 10% in 2016) applies for certain goods and services.
Foreign trade: In 2016 the value of exported goods was US$142.8bn and the goods import bill was US$143bn. The services surplus, traditionally boosted by tourism receipts, was US$11.3bn. Along with a modest primary income deficit and significant secondary income deficit, this yielded a current-account surplus equivalent to 1.7% of GDP.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
Following several years of little progress on reforms, and coalition and party in-fighting, the grand coalition of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) fell apart in May 2017 following the resignation of Reinhold Mitterlehner from the positions of vice-chancellor, minister of economy and leader of the ÖVP, citing frustration within his own party. The popular 30-year-old minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, has taken over the leadership of the ÖVP and will run as the party's lead candidate in the early general election on October 15th. However, probably owing to the party's recent poor performance in the polls (it has languished in third place over the past year) Mr Kurz decided to leverage his own popularity by demanding full control over the ÖVP and that the party appear on the ballot as "List Sebastian Kurz-the New People's Party", which would also include people not previously associated with the ÖVP. Following Mr Kurz's arrival as party leader the ÖVP shot to the top of the polls, pushing the opposition far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) to third place, from first. This "Kurz effect" could wane slightly in the coming months, as Mr Kurz will be forced to continue working in the dysfunctional coalition, will face increasing scrutiny of his policies and will need time to build new structures to lead a reformed ÖVP. As a result, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the election to be a three-horse race between the ÖVP, the SPÖ and the FPÖ, with the ÖVP currently best placed to emerge as the largest party in the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house of parliament).
Nevertheless, the election will be a next step in the fraying of the decades-long dominance of the political scene by the SPÖ and the ÖVP, as the ÖVP will have been effectively replaced by Mr Kurz's new movement. The two parties have together ruled the country almost continuously since 1945, and a renewed grand coalition has become almost impossible following the breakdown of relations between the two parties and the gridlock in recent years. The FPÖ has profited from this and from concerns about immigration, although Mr Kurz looks to be drawing voters away from the FPÖ, in large part based on his strong stance on immigration and border control.
The most likely coalition to emerge after the election is one led by the ÖVP, with the FPÖ as a junior coalition partner, as the other parties-including the Greens and NEOS, a liberal party-are unlikely to be large enough to help either the SPÖ or the ÖVP to reach a parliamentary majority. Risks to this outlook are high, as the election could turn and the coalition negotiations could falter, because the FPÖ will probably demand significant concessions from Mr Kurz. Regardless of which coalition emerges, we expect political stability to deteriorate further. The government will struggle to implement its policies, as the coalition partners are likely to disagree on economic matters, and the FPÖ is likely to struggle to translate its opposition on matters such as immigration and integration into concrete policy proposals.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
The next general election is scheduled for October 15th 2017. The most likely scenario is that the rebranded ÖVP under Mr Kurz will win the largest share of the vote, although not an outright majority, and subsequently form a coalition with the FPÖ.
Elections for some state parliaments are planned for the first half of 2018. The next election for the primarily ceremonial post of federal president will be in 2022.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Austria was severely affected by the European migrant crisis, and this has been the dominant issue in its domestic politics and international relations since 2015. The country has been at the centre of many of the intra-EU spats regarding the bloc's response to the large influx of migrants, owing in part to its unilateral actions. Domestic pressure on the government to be seen as acting against this influx, and thus often against other EU member states, will remain high owing to the strong position of the FPÖ, and it seems to have driven the government to lower its annual cap on asylum applications. The government has repeatedly hinted that it wants to limit labour migration within the EU, or at least give preferential treatment to Austrian citizens in the labour market, which will exacerbate tensions with many EU member states.
We expect a new government to continue along the same line, as most parties have supported such an approach. Although the previous inclusion of the FPÖ in government following the election in 1999 led to sanctions being imposed by other EU nations in 2000, we do not expect this to be repeated should the party join the next governing coalition. Although at that time a far-right nationalist party entering government was a relatively unusual development, since then sister parties to the FPÖ have either entered government or supported minority governments in parliament in several EU countries, including some Nordic countries and the Netherlands.
The rerun of the presidential election in December 2016 demonstrated the relatively broad support for EU membership. Many voters cited as one of their main reasons for voting for Alexander Van der Bellen-the independent candidate running against Norbert Hofer, the FPÖ candidate-suggestions by Mr Hofer of a possible membership referendum in Austria if the EU did not reform or if Turkey joined. This experience should moderate any further attempts by the FPÖ to use the EU as a divisive issue.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
Alongside the 2016 tax reform, which provided about EUR5bn in tax relief to households, government policy has focused on challenges facing the country's financial sector. These have included the clean-up and debt restructuring of Heta Asset Resolution, a "bad bank" that was created to deal with the toxic assets of Hypo Group Alpe Adria (HGAA). The uncertainty surrounding Heta was removed in October 2016, when creditors accepted a debt-restructuring deal. The government has also had to manage the banking sector's exposure to central and east European economies.
In the renegotiation of its coalition agreement in January 2017 the coalition decided on a number of measures that it hoped to implement before the end of its term, in 2018. These included a new annual minimum wage of EUR21,000, as opposed to only sector-specific negotiated minimum wages, and reducing red tape for employers, including more flexible rules on working hours. However, although the coalition parties agreed to implement a number of these measures before the election in October, we expect little progress, as both parties will be focused on the election and, in the case of the ÖVP, on reforming the party itself.
The next government, which is likely to include the FPÖ, will move integration and immigration policy further to the right and is likely to focus on improving the business environment, including by reducing the sizeable tax wedge, but we would expect it to struggle to implement significant structural reforms rapidly.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
In 2014 Austria's fiscal accounts deteriorated, mainly reflecting the govern-ment's decision to create a bad bank to deal with HGAA's toxic assets. The fiscal deficit widened to the equivalent of 2.7% of GDP, from 1.3% in 2013, and public debt rose to 84.4% of GDP. Mainly in response to steady direct revenue growth, the deficit narrowed to 1% of GDP in 2015, but widened again in 2016, to 1.5%, owing in part to fiscally expansionary tax reforms and higher migrant-related public spending.
We expect the budget to remain in deficit throughout the forecast period (2017-21), albeit within 1% of GDP from 2018, as fiscal con-solidation will continue to be limited and growth solid, but unspectacular. The public debt stock as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline gradually, from 84.6% in 2016, following a positive contribu-tion from the Heta deal, to more than 75% in 2021. In the context of the quanti-tative easing (QE) undertaken by the European Central Bank (ECB) and Austria's relatively strong fundamentals, funding risks are extremely low in our view.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
The euro zone economy is showing increasing momentum at present, and we expect another healthy expansion in the region's economy this year, after growth of 1.8% on average in 2015-16. Nonetheless, the ECB is continuing to pursue an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero, a series of so-called targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) aimed at pushing banks to lend more money and a EUR60bn per month QE programme, which will run until the end of 2017.
The ECB's president, Mario Draghi, stressed that the recent reduction in the pace of QE (from EUR80bn per month in March) was designed to sustain the bank's presence in the market for a longer period and should not be viewed as "tapering", which would signify a winding down of the programme. We expect tapering to begin in 2018, but downside risks to global growth during that year, including our forecast for an economic slowdown in China and tighter monetary policy in the US, suggest that the pace at which the ECB unwinds its accommodative policy stance will be gradual. We maintain our forecast that the ECB will not tighten policy rates before the end of our forecast period, in 2021.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Austria's initial recovery from the global financial crisis was respectable in the euro zone context, but subsequently the economy largely stalled and under-performed in comparison with regional peers, notably Germany, which was particularly striking given the traditionally high level of synchronisation between the two countries' business cycles. A faltered reform process has contributed to higher inflation compared with regional peers and weakened productivity growth, admittedly from fairly high levels. Real GDP rose by a sluggish 0.8% in 2015, and although it accelerated in 2016, to 1.6%, remained below Germany's 1.8% growth.
However, the economy has recently started to gain momentum again, with quarterly growth of 0.6% in the past three quarters. Although the labour market had in previous years struggled to integrate the significant increase in the labour force, it seemed to have turned a corner in late 2016 and early 2017, when the unemployment rate started to fall. This is supporting private consumption, which we expect to grow by 1.8% this year, and the uptick in growth throughout the region is supporting export growth, with exports to other EU economies up by 11.5% year on year in the first quarter. As a result, we expect growth to accelerate to an upwardly revised 1.9% this year, broadly in line with that of regional peers.
We expect the current phase of catch-up growth-following an under-performance even compared with fundamentals in recent years-to continue next year, when we forecast that the economy will expand by 1.7%, broadly in line with regional peers. A worsening global economic environment in 2018-19, when we expect a policy-driven slowdown in China and a cyclical slowdown in the US, will weigh on growth in the second half of our five-year forecast period, as will the continued lack of reform progress. Domestic demand will be the main driver of growth, which is likely to converge towards potential growth in these years. We therefore expect average real GDP growth of just 1.4% in 2018-21.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
Annual consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) has been subdued in recent years, but higher than in most other euro zone countries. Inflation averaged 0.8% in 2015 and 1% in 2016-well above average inflation in Germany and the euro zone in both years. This largely reflects structural domestic factors, such as higher unit wage costs, more regulated markets and a period of faster increases in taxes and duties. Rising services prices, energy price base effects and the lagged feedthrough of euro weakness via import costs fostered a gradual rise in inflation from October 2016, and will continue to do so in the rest of 2017, when we forecast full-year average inflation of 2.2%. We expect inflation to stay above the euro zone average in 2018-21, at 2% on average, as similar structural factors as in previous years persist.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
The euro has moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1 since mid-2015. The annual average exchange rate was US$1.11:EUR1 in 2016, although a sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following the presidential election in the US led to a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1. The euro has since rallied as the region's economic recovery has continued and political risk has waned. However, the common currency's resilience may be tested again in forthcoming elections, and faster economic growth and tighter monetary policy in the US will lend support to the dollar. We expect the exchange rate to average US$1.08:EUR1 in 2017-18, before appreciating gradually in 2019-21. We do not expect the euro to return to its long-term average value against the dollar even by the end of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
Low oil prices and subdued domestic demand compressing import values helped the trade balance to move into surplus in 2014-15, from a deficit in 2009-13. The recent recovery has pushed up imports and moved the trade balance back into a small deficit in 2016. We expect growth in domestic demand and a slight rise in oil prices to weigh on the trade balance in the coming years. However, this will be compensated for by a healthy surplus on the services balance, driven in large part by robust tourism inflows. We therefore expect continued current-account surpluses in our forecast period, of about 2%.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The president, Mauricio Macri of the centre-right Propuesta Republicana, is pressing ahead with a programme of economic policy adjustment in an effort to eliminate distortions and return the economy to sustainable growth. The adjustment process is proving difficult, involving politically unpopular austerity measures, and the risk of social unrest will therefore remain significant for much of the forecast period.
Given the president's minority position in Congress, and the priority given to urgent macroeconomic reforms, there is likely to be only limited progress on the pursuit of legislation that would successfully address longstanding institutional weaknesses and structural constraints to growth. Comprehensive reforms to strengthen bureaucracy, reduce corruption or enhance the effectiveness and independence of the judiciary will be slow. Furthermore, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect meaningful advances-at least in the short term-on a structural reform agenda (incorporating tax and labour market reform) that could improve long-term potential growth rates.
After a contraction in real GDP in 2016, reflecting macroeconomic policy tightening and currency depreciation, we are forecasting a pick-up in exports, investment and private consumption in the medium term. There will be a boost in business confidence from policy tightening. Combined with macroeconomic adjustment, and a gradual removal of foreign-exchange and import controls, these policies should set the economy on a more solid long-term footing. However, some aspects of the policymaking environment will remain suboptimal, with labour-market reform and a comprehensive fiscal reform remaining low on the agenda.
Currency adjustment should gradually bolster the current account as a weaker peso starts to boost goods and services exports and rein in imports. On this basis, we expect the current-account deficit to narrow in 2017, but it will begin to widen again from 2019 to end the forecast period at 2.9% of GDP. We also expect the country's ability to finance moderate current-account deficits to improve over the forecast period, assuming that capital inflows pick up as investor confidence in the Macri administration grows.
Argentina's GDP per head is still among the highest in the region and, combined with improved access to credit, moderate rates of economic growth in the medium term will boost purchasing power and create market opportunities. Still-high poverty rates and income inequality will restrict the pool of consumers, but to a lesser extent than in many other countries in the region.

Argentina's global business environment score improves substantially in 2017-21, and the country jumps 17 places in our global ranking. A period of economic policy adjustment is under way as the centre-right government works to tighten macroeconomic policy, reduce state intervention in the private sector and encourage private investment. However, in many areas improve-ments will take time to materialise.
Country forecast overview: Argentina's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: The administration of Mauricio Macri works to address key weaknesses, including weak competition policy, the heavy burden of red tape and restrictive price controls.
2019-21: Continued work to build confidence in legal and regulatory framework. State participation in key sectors continues.
Policy toward foreign investment
2017-18: Efforts to resolve any remaining disputes with international creditors and investors as the government seeks fresh sources of US dollar inflows.
2019-21: Foreign direct investment is welcome. Improvement made in investment dispute settlement and availability of investment-protection schemes.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Any remaining foreign-exchange controls likely to be removed. Continued efforts to improve the workings of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union) and develop closer relations with the Pacific Alliance.
2019-21: Possibility that free-trade agreements make better progress.
Taxes
2017-18: Further gradual reductions of export taxes to encourage domestic supply. Tax system remains complex and burdensome.
2019-21: Comprehensive tax reform to improve federal-provincial revenue a possibility, but obstacles to reform persist.
Financing
2017-18: Banking penetration remains weak and long-term credit restricted, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, owing to weak long-term deposit base.
2019-21: Non-bank financing grows, but is constrained by a relatively small pool of institutional investors.
The labour market
2017-18: Tension with unions, owing to inflation. Political and bargaining power of the unions will remain strong.
2019-21: Progress on labour reform unlikely. Continued potential for conflicts with unions. Some skills shortages.
Infrastructure
2017-18: The Macri administration works to address weak contract rights and deficient regulatory regimes, which keep private investment below potential. Financing constraints hamper public investment in the short term.
2019-21: Some public and private investment set to improve energy supply and upgrade export infrastructure, but the risk of energy shortages will persist as demand grows.

Background: Economic liberalisation in the 1990s drove firm growth, but an inflexible exchange-rate mechanism and fail-ure to deepen structural reform left the economy vulnerable to shocks, contributing to the collapse in 2001 of Fernando de la Rúa's centre-left government. An interim government took power until Néstor Kirchner of the Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party) began a term in 2003. He presided over an economic rebound, which enabled his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, to win the presidency in 2007 and secure re-election in 2011. Economic policy mismanage-ment drove a change of government in 2015, with a centre-right candidate, Mauricio Macri, taking office in December 2015.
Political structure: Democracy was restored to Argentina in 1983 after 50 years of instability and military regimes. A strong presidential system is in theory checked by a bicameral Congress, comprising a 257-member Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and a 72-member Senate (the upper house); in practice, however, the presidency dominates. The presidential term is four years. There are 23 provinces and the Buenos Aires federal district, each with its own government.
Policy issues: Pro-cyclical expansionary policies contributed to GDP growth of an annual average 6.6% in 2005-11. But expansionary policy also produced significant imbalances in the economy in the form of double-digit inflation, real peso appreciation and a deterioration of the balance of payments. Amid currency pressures, the Fernández government resorted to foreign-exchange, import and capital controls, as well as ad hoc interventionism, to the detriment of the business environment. These policies did not reduce devaluation speculation, and left the economy extremely vulnerable to currency crisis. Macroeconomic adjustments to reduce economic distortions and set the economy on a more solid long-term footing are taking place under Mr Macri; these include peso devaluation, and fiscal and monetary tightening. Microeconomic reforms to boost domestic supply are also getting under way.
Taxation: The value-added tax (VAT) rate is 21%, although VAT on some goods and services is charged at a lower rate of 10.5%, and some services are taxed at a higher rate of 27%. Corporate income tax is levied at 35%, and personal income tax at progressive rates between 9% and 35%. There is a 0.6% tax on financial transactions (deposits and withdrawals). Taxes on exports were reintroduced in 2002, and have since been expanded to account for around 20% of total revenue.
Foreign trade: The current account shifted from surplus to deficit in 2010. Despite comprehensive controls, there was a current-account deficit of 2.7% of GDP in 2015.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
The political scene is becoming more complicated as voter fatigue with austerity increases and patience with adjustment measures wears thin. An increase in union obstructionism since March is unsurprising amid annual wage-bargaining negotiations that are taking place in the run-up to mid-term legislative elections on October 22nd. More of a concern for the president, Mauricio Macri of the centre-right Propuesta Republicana (Pro), is the continued perception among voters that adjustment is not bringing about obvious rapid improvements in the economy. Various economic indicators suggest that the economy is indeed emerging from recession, but consumers are not yet feeling the benefit in terms of higher real wages or increased employment.
The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect Mr Macri to abandon the adjustment process that he has pursued since taking office for a four-year term in late 2015. This process has involved devaluation, fiscal and monetary tightening, and sharp tariff adjustments. In this environment, voter weariness with auster-ity, combined with the approaching mid-terms, will in the short term complicate relations with Congress, where the president lacks a majority. The ruling Cambiemos alliance, which includes the Pro and the centre-left Unión Cívica Radical, has to negotiate support for its legislative agenda in both houses of Congress on an ad hoc basis with the various factions of the large Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party). So far this support has mainly been forthcoming, not least because the Peronists have had trouble regrouping under a clear leader-ship since losing the presidency in 2015. The largest faction of the party, the Frente para la Victoria, has been weakened by a series of corruption scandals, while moderate Peronists have frequently supported government legislation.
We expect obstructionism to increase amid election-related politicking surrounding the mid-terms in October, and as a presidential election in October 2019 approaches. But mutual interest will ensure some continuing co-operation between Cambiemos and moderate Peronists. On top of this, a strong executive branch (the president has substantial powers to rule by decree) should provide Mr Macri with room for manoeuvre, even assuming that Congress becomes less co-operative. The president will also retain influence with powerful provincial governors, who largely control the agenda of the Senate (the upper house) but who are in turn deeply reliant on central government transfers, some of which are discretionary. As a result, we expect some continued progress on the govern-ment agenda. However, there will be limited progress on legislation that would successfully address long-standing institutional weaknesses and structural constraints to growth. Compre-hensive efforts to strengthen bureaucracy, reduce corruption or enhance the effectiveness and independence of the judiciary will be slow. We do not expect meaningful advances on a structural reform agenda.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
Mid-term elections are set for October 22nd. Open, nationwide primary elections will be held on August 13th, although in practice, Argentina's political parties continue to choose their candidates via internal selection processes, and the primaries will therefore serve as a sort of dress rehearsal for the main event. With the primaries now approaching, campaigning is beginning to dominate the political scene. The ruling Pro and its partners in the Cambiemos coalition are currently in a minority position in both houses of Congress, and we do not expect this to change in the mid-terms. For Cambiemos, a more important marker is whether it gains or loses seats, and how it performs on the Buenos Aires province congressional list (voters select party lists; this gauges both how popular the political parties are and how popular the leading candidates on each list are). On this measure, Cambiemos should do fairly well, partly because the dominant, heterogeneous Peronist party is deeply divided.
The former Peronist president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-15) has created a new party altogether (to avoid primary elections) and announced her intention to run for Senate. Ms Fernández's presence in the race will not only divide the Peronist vote, but also give focus to the Cambiemos campaign, which currently lacks the strong economic recovery narrative that it was hoping for at the start of the year. Instead, Cambiemos can now frame the mid-terms as a fight between a modernising government and the cronyism of the past. (Ms Fernández is currently under investigation for corruption during her time as president, and a congressional seat would provide her with immunity from prosecution.) On this basis we expect Cambiemos to do well enough to retain good working relations with moderate Peronists in the legislature.
The next presidential election is due in October 2019. Based on our assumption of moderate GDP growth and a return to single-digit inflation by then, we currently expect Mr Macri to win a second four-year term. There are substantial risks to this forecast, given the challenging external environment and the government's minority position in Congress. Reflecting the difficulties faced by minority governments in Argentina, no non-Peronist government has won a second consecutive term since the end of the military dictatorship in the 1980s. In this context, the emergence of a strong challenger from the moderate wing of the Peronist party is a major possibility, and the election will be closely fought.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Efforts by the Macri government to repair relations with trade and invest-ment partners have achieved rapid results, and we expect relations with key trade partners in the region and elsewhere to remain strong. The Argentinian govern-ment will remain keen to seek trade deals under the auspices of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay; Venezuela was suspended from the group in 2016). The problem for Argentina and its Mercosur partners is that, just as the grouping has started to reverse its own protectionist tendencies, free trade has shifted off the political agenda not only in the US but also in Europe. Mr Macri recently visited Spain in an effort to drum up support for a deal, and negotiations are continuing. Our forecasts do not currently assume a successful conclusion of free-trade talks with the EU, but the workings of intra-Mercosur trade are likely to improve in the forecast period. Efforts at joining the Pacific Alliance, a regional trading bloc that includes Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico, may also make progress, although this is not currently reflected in our five-year economic forecasts.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
The Macri administration has made good initial progress on a programme of adjustment intended to put the economy on a sounder footing, having devalued the peso, reduced agricultural export duties and energy subsidies, and secured a deal with holdout creditors (allowing Argentina to exit default and tap international capital markets again). However, macroeconomic adjustment remains incomplete, and policy efforts to reduce inflation will continue, in the form of tight fiscal and monetary policy, and restraint in nominal wage growth. The latter in particular is proving a difficult political challenge, and has encountered stiff union resistance. The government is extremely unlikely to meet its goal of limiting nominal wage growth to 20% this year, but we do continue to expect nominal wages to trend downwards steadily from levels of above 30% in recent years. All of these measures should gradually engender price stability and ultimately boost investor confidence, although we do not expect inflation to fall to single-digit levels until 2019.
With macroeconomic adjustment measures proceeding apace, the government is gradually turning its attention to the structural reform agenda and to reforms to improve the business environment, and we expect a growing policy emphasis on these areas. The government has already passed new public-private partnership framework legislation that should facilitate an increase in infrastructure investment, along with reforms to reduce red-tape financing for small and medium-sized enterprises. The development of longer-term finance and the deepening of Argentina's currently shallow capital markets will be a priority. However, other aspects of the policymaking environ-ment will remain suboptimal, with progress on labour-market reform (to improve flexibility) or comprehensive fiscal and tax reform (to reduce costs and complexity) unlikely in the medium term amid political obstruction.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
Higher-than-expected revenue from a tax amnesty on undeclared foreign assets will bolster the fiscal accounts and allow the government to meet its target of narrowing the primary deficit to 4% of GDP in 2017, slightly below the 4.3% of GDP primary deficit registered in 2016. We expect the government's gradualist approach to fiscal tightening to continue in subsequent years, bringing the overall fiscal deficit down to a more manageable level of 3.3% of GDP by 2021, by which time the primary deficit will have dropped to about 1% of GDP. The govern-ment has taken some important steps in the past 18 months to try to narrow the deficit, particularly by reducing costly subsidies and the public-sector payroll. Even so, in the light of income-tax breaks and increased transfers (to expand the social safety net), deficit reduction will be slow.
In the aftermath of the holdout deal, and assuming that there is progress on deficit reduction, the government's ability to finance moderate deficits without resorting to inflationary money printing will be much improved. A moderate, though rising, public debt/GDP ratio (and low levels of external indebtedness), combined with the attractiveness of Argentina's still-high yields, should facilitate international bond issuance in 2017-21, following Argentina's exit from default in 2016. The sovereign's much-improved access to internal finance (and a clear search for yield) was evident in June, when the sovereign issued US$2.5bn in 100-year global bonds at a yield of 7.92%. As a percentage of GDP, the public debt will stabilise at slightly over 50% in 2017-21.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
Notwithstanding a recent policy reversal, which saw the Banco Central de la República Argentina (BCRA, the central bank) lift the policy rate from 24.75% to 26.25% in April (it has kept rates unchanged since then), we continue to expect fairly substantial rate cuts in the second half of 2017 and beyond. The BCRA responded to rising inflation expectations with what we expect to be a one-off rate rise in April to make its commitment to the newly implemented inflation-targeting framework clear. Assuming that monthly inflation starts to fall towards 1% on a consistent basis, we expect ample scope for renewed monetary easing in the third quarter of 2017.
The central bank has made it clear that it will prioritise monetary policy that is conducive to a reduction of inflation, and our forecasts assume moderately positive real interest rates in the medium term, consistent with a deepening of credit and the development of long-term lending. This forecast is supported by the shift to an inflation-targeting regime (with the target due to be lowered to 8-12% in 2018 and 5% in 2019), and by reduced political interference after a period of politicisation under the previous administration.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
After a contraction in real GDP of 22% in 2016, we expect a return to positive territory in 2017. But with Brazil's economic recovery likely to stall in 2017 amid an escalating political crisis, manufacturing activity in Argentina will recover only moderately, limiting GDP growth to 2.7%. We currently expect the recovery to peak in 2018, with growth of 3.4%. However, the growth rate for that year masks an expected sequential deceleration in the second half of 2018, resulting from a projected weakening of Chinese import demand. By 2019, when we project a cyclical downturn in the US economy, real GDP growth in Argentina will slide back below 3%, before a modest recovery takes hold in 2020-21.
Our forecast for a relatively robust recovery in the medium term is based on the assumption that a combination of macroeconomic adjustment and improve-ments to the business environment will eventually have some beneficial impact on both export activity and domestic demand. An easing of inflation, combined with efforts by the Macri government to address the problem of legal and regulatory uncertainty and reduce red tape, should set the stage for renewed strong growth in fixed investment and private consumption, support-ing an acceleration of GDP growth. On the supply side, growth should be bolstered in 2017 and into the medium term by a positive outlook for agriculture, and for investment in both infrastructure and energy, including renewables.
There are downside risks to our GDP forecasts, as attempts by the government to reduce economic distortions and engineer a smooth adjustment to a lower-inflation environment could prove extremely challenging. However, there is also some upside risk, as investment could overtake expectations from 2017 once the gains from macro-economic adjustment materialise and depending on the success of efforts to improve the framework for doing business. However, even in this scenario, in the absence of deeper structural reform efforts than we currently envisage, the potential growth rate will remain closer to 3% than 4%.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
Consumer price inflation will decline steadily but gradually in the forecast period, from a rate of 25.4% in May (according to the Buenos Aires city price index). Although high, the May result represents a steep fall from a peak of 47.2% in July 2016, which resulted from currency and tariff adjust-ments by the new administration. Assuming tight monetary and fiscal policy (spending growth will remain negative in real terms until 2018), we expect gradual disinflation in the medium term, provided that domestic demand remains subdued relative to the boom years of 2004-11 and domestic supply strengthens on the back of an improved regulatory environ-ment for agricultural and other producers. The main risks to this forecast stem from possible failure to tighten fiscal policy as projected, a weaker than expected peso and the difficult process of reining in nominal wage growth. However, if the government is able to tackle the high level of wage indexation, there is also the potential for inflation to slow more quickly than we currently project.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
The peso has weakened modestly since late May, reflecting some contagion effects from Brazil's political crisis, but at Ps16.1:US$1 in late June, the currency was only slightly weaker than the end-2016 level of Ps15.9:US$1. We expect further modest weakening of the peso in 2017-21, particularly in 2017-18, as domestic interest rates decline and the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) continues a monetary tightening cycle. However, the positive outlook for portfolio and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows will be supportive of the currency, which will dampen depreciation pressure and produce some periods of real currency appreciation (as occurred in early 2017). In nominal terms, we expect the peso to end 2017 at Ps17.6:US$1 and 2021 at Ps23.37:US$1.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
An improvement in the terms of trade will help to widen the trade surplus and narrow the current-account deficit in 2017, to 2.1% of GDP. However, the terms of trade will gradually deteriorate in the remainder of the forecast period, producing a renewed narrowing of the trade surplus. On top of this, a still-strong peso will contribute to a persistently large services deficit, and the income deficit will widen as interest payments on a growing stock of external debt, along with repatriation of profits by multinationals operating in the country, increase. As a result, the current-account deficit will widen again gradually, to a peak of 2.9% of GDP in 2021. The country's ability to finance moderate current-account deficits of this size has improved, and assuming that portfolio and FDI inflows rise as investor confidence grows, the result will be a rise in foreign reserves in nominal terms. Our forecasts currently assume FDI inflows averaging just under 2% of GDP in 2017-21, with foreign reserves equivalent to an annual average of eight months of import cover in the same period. This represents a substantial increase on 2015 levels, and mainly represents extremely high portfolio inflows in the past 18 months.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The struggle between an opposition-dominated legislature and a government with control of key institutions will keep tension high and sustain uncertainty regarding The Economist Intelligence Unit's political and economic forecasts. Despite the unpopularity of the administration led by the president, Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), and the persistent risk of economic collapse, we believe that the government will muddle through until the next elections are held in December 2018, after which we expect the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática coalition to take office. A risk exists that the PSUV will seek non-democratic ways to cling to power.
A fundamental rebalancing of the economy is needed to avoid default and economic collapse, but there has been no sign of significant economic reform. Policy mismanagement will persist while Mr Maduro remains in office. Key problems include extremely expansionary macroeconomic policy, soaring inflation and a business climate that discourages investment. A new government will begin a gradual process of adjustment from 2019.
Sweeping reforms are required to restore confidence in contract and property rights, and thereby promote a recovery in investment. The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. From 2019 a new government will encourage private investment, re-establish market mechanisms for price stability and attempt to undo the constraints imposed by the PSUV on private firms.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and triple-digit inflation will hit private consumption, and the increasingly difficult operating environment will accentuate the fall in fixed investment. The recession that began in 2014 will continue to deepen despite the partial recovery in oil prices and the economy will not return to growth until 2020. Our forecast for a weak recovery in 2020-21 rests on the assumption of a new government that implements macroeconomic adjustment alongside institutional and structural reform. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, and our forecasts imply only a partial recovery.
At almost 300bn barrels, Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves, but its oil sector has suffered from disinvestment and mismanagement owing to political interference. The government claims that rising investment in the energy sector will lift oil production significantly in the medium term, but we foresee a continued fall in production in 2017, and only a minor increase from 2018 as economic conditions stabilise.

Venezuela is in 79th position globally in our business environment rankings for 2017-21, out of 82 countries covered. It is therefore one of the least attractive investment locations. This reflects state interventionism, highly heterodox macroeconomic policies, a lack of legal security and weak institutions. Regionally, Venezuela moves ahead of Cuba to 11th place of the 12 countries covered, assuming improvements after 2019.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Government persists with bias against free markets and ad hoc recourse to heterodox measures. Nationalisation poses a diminished threat, given fiscal weaknesses. Property rights remain weak. Price fixing undermines profitability.
2019-21: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Access to project financing is difficult and uncertainty over contractual rights persists.
2019-21: Efforts to attract foreign investment gather pace under a new government, although actual investment flows remain fairly low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2017-18: Frequent ad hoc adjustments to the unorthodox exchange-rate policy framework add to uncertainty. The state continues to exercise tight control over access to official-rate US dollars. Private firms must use a much weaker rate.
2019-21: Efforts to remove trade and exchange controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly, after a political transition takes place.
Taxes
2017-18: Government's low approval ratings reduce the risk of tax increases, despite the huge fiscal deficit. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2019-21: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2017-18: Credit growth remains firm, but sectoral allocation is distorted by administrative interventions. Banks remain highly profitable, although unpredictable enforcement and a weak regulatory framework heighten instability.
2019-21: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2017-18: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. An ongoing freeze on redundancies, combined with a large informal sector and skill shortages, makes the labour market exceptionally rigid.
2019-21: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Access to water and electricity supplies remains precarious. Underinvestment in power transmission ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2019-21: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued electricity rationing.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Chávez was diagnosed with cancer in 2011 but, after declaring in July 2012 that he had fully recovered, won a fourth presidential term in October 2012. However, his health quickly deteriorated and he died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has since plummeted.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is a federal republic, successive administrations have proven reluctant to devolve political authority, with the transfer of financial resources from federal to local level highly dependent on the central government. The legislature is unicameral, and elections for the National Assembly take place every five years. In December 2015 the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the legislature, but its powers have been usurped by other branches of government dominated by the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV). In May Mr Maduro announced that he wanted to rewrite the 1999 Constitution-apparently a ploy to entrench the PSUV in power.
Policy issues: Political radicalisation has been reflected in increasingly heterodox economic policymaking, with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus, and the nationalisation of industries deemed strategically important. Distortions created by this approach have become evident, with inflation rising sharply in spite of price controls, and with capital controls spawning a rampant black market for foreign exchange. Failure to invest part of the oil windfall has led to a startling decline in physical infrastructure. Non-oil production has in effect ground to a halt, leaving the economy entirely dependent on the energy sector. With large oil shipments going to China to repay loans, and (on subsidised terms) to regional neighbours via the PetroCaribe oil-financing scheme, the country is running very short of US dollars, forcing cuts in import spending.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 60% for oil firms. Since 2011 a maximum royalty of 95% has applied to oil extraction. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Official data are unavailable, but The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$5.8bn in 2016 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages. The current-account deficit is estimated to have fallen from 4.3% of GDP in 2015 to 2.1% of GDP in 2016.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
Amid the most severe economic crisis in the country's history, Venezuela's political scene will remain dominated by a volatile power struggle between the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) government, led by the president, Nicolás Maduro, and the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD), which won a majority in the National Assembly in late 2015. Political tension has escalated amid growing signs that the government is seeking to cling to power through non-democratic means. In late May Mr Maduro announced rules, heavily skewed in the regime's favour, for the selection of members to a constituent assembly charged with rewriting the constitution promulgated by his predecessor, Hugo Chávez (1999-2013). Constitutional reform proposals seem designed both to reduce the role of the elected National Assembly and to postpone, perhaps indefinitely, national elections due to be held in December 2018. Before this, the government used its control of key state institutions to scupper opposition efforts to hold a recall referendum (allowed under the constitution) this year to remove Mr Maduro. The government also effectively eliminated the National Assembly's legislative powers. Violent public protests have ensued in response (with over 60 civilians killed since April); these show little sign of letting up, but are unlikely to weaken the Maduro government's hold on power.
This grip on authority is largely based on the continuing support of the military, which will play a decisive role in future political developments. The govern-ment has, to date, secured military backing by eliminating dissent in its upper echelons and by including the military in a system of patronage that has given it significant policymaking powers. It is not certain to what extent the military would be willing to support the government if it were to attempt to hold onto power by non-democratic means.
There have been instances in the recent past in which the military and other political actors have been seen to intervene to force the government to respect democratic norms. After the legislative election in 2015, the defence minister, Vladimir Padrino López, affirmed publicly that the army would uphold the constitution. Earlier in 2017 the attorney-general, Luisa Ortega, criticised a Supreme Court attempt to take over the National Assembly's powers, which was subsequently abandoned. More recently, she disparaged plans to rewrite the constitution. All of this suggests that there are limits to support for the beleaguered Maduro administration from its allies in the military and elsewhere. The opposition is working to encourage defectors from within government and military ranks. It is possible that it may offer immunity from prosecution as an enticement to switch sides. On this basis, The Economist Intelligence Unit still expects the elections in December 2018 to take place, and for the MUD, which would be the clear favourite, to win, taking power in 2019. But there is a high risk that the PSUV, with the backing of the armed forces, will attempt to cling to power beyond this date. Given the scale of opposition to the government, and the increasingly limited means of addressing opposition concerns via institutional channels, there is also a strong risk of some sort of chaotic, violent political transition, particularly in the context of a crippling economic crisis that the government has shown little willingness or capacity to address.
Assuming that an MUD-led government does take power, it would implement economic adjustments to reduce the role of the state in the economy, and unravel the many macroeconomic and monetary distortions that the PSUV has implemented since it came to power in 1999. It will also begin the difficult task of reforming deeply politicised institutions. Given the scale of the economic distortion and institutional destruction that has taken place in Venezuela, as well as the heterogeneous nature of the MUD-which is aligned mainly in its desire to remove the current government from office-the process will not be a smooth one. Weak institutional capacity and high political tension will persist throughout the 2017-21 forecast period.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
With the next presidential election due in December 2018, the electoral authorities are placing a host of obstacles in the MUD coalition's path, forcing most parties to re-register and banning a leading opposition figure and presidential frontrunner, Henrique Capriles, from running for election for 15 years, citing "administrative irregularities" in his tenure as governor of Miranda state. Nevertheless, assuming that open elections are held, we expect the MUD to win by a substantial margin (as it did in legislative elections in 2015). The timing of the elections is, however, increasingly uncertain. The contro-versial constitutional redrafting proposed by Mr Maduro entails a long rewriting process and will be put to a nationwide referendum, all of which would take time and could be used as a pretext for delaying elections. The position of the military towards any such efforts, and to the election process itself, will be decisive, and the risks to our forecasts are unusually high.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Venezuela is isolated diplomatically amid growing regional and international censure of the Maduro regime, although this is doing little to weaken the government's grip on power. The government has announced its withdrawal from the Organisation of American States (OAS, an institution promoting regional co-operation, and a frequent election observer), pre-empting a probable suspension from the organisation. Venezuela was suspended from Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) in late 2016. Although relations with neighbouring countries such as Colombia will deteriorate in the short term, the Maduro administration appears to be more concerned with retaining good relations with China (a key creditor), and with not provoking the US administration, presumably to avoid economic measures by that country, such as a cut in oil imports, which would hit Venezuela extremely hard. US-Venezuela tension would escalate if the PSUV government were to attempt to cling to power by suspending the next elections. Reflecting its external financing difficulties, Venezuela will continue to scale back-and possibly end-oil shipments to beneficiaries of PetroCaribe, an agreement that provides cheap financing for oil exports to regional allies. Relations with Cuba, the closest of these allies, will become more distant as Venezuela's ability to provide assistance is eroded.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
It is unlikely that the government will be able to manage the build-up of inflationary and currency depreciation pressures without some sort of policy adjustment between now and the presidential election. We assume that the Maduro government will be forced to weaken the currency more substantially in 2017-18 than it did last year. However, other much-needed reforms are unlikely to be addressed by a government that has proved unwilling or unable to adjust policy sufficiently to move Venezuela's economy away from the brink of collapse. Fiscal and monetary policies will remain expansionary, and ad hoc policy interventionism and heavy state control of the economy will persist. Slightly higher oil prices than in 2014-16 will bring some relief, but import compression will remain necessary, as other sources of foreign exchange will be hard to find. International reserves totalled US$10.1bn in early May, far below historical levels, and down by about 20% year on year. Even after a 2016 restructuring of debt owed by PDVSA, the state-owned oil firm, substantial external debt payments are falling due in 2017-18. We currently expect Venezuela to meet its 2017 obligations, which are mostly owed by PDVSA (it made a US$2.1bn coupon payment in April). However, given the extremely thin reserves cushion, the risk of default remains high; this would have dramatic economic and political consequences in the form of a sharp decrease in oil production, reduced import capacity, hyperinflation and political turmoil.
We expect the opposition to take power in 2019, ushering in much-needed market-driven adjustments designed to correct currency distortions, alleviate shortages of basic goods, tighten expansionary fiscal policy and rebuild institutional capacity after years of deterioration under PSUV rule. It is probable, given the scale of the challenge, that the new government will seek a financing agreement with the IMF to support the adjustment process; we have factored in accumulated lending of over US$16bn in 2019-21. Efforts to secure increased inflows of foreign direct investment would also be likely under a new government, and would help to improve the balance-of-payments dynamics, although we expect direct investors to remain cautious for some time with regards to Venezuela, with the possible exception of the oil sector.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
The authorities' failure to publish data on the non-financial public sector since 2012 demonstrates the opacity of the public finances and complicates accurate forecasting of the size of the deficit. After ballooning to an estimated 24.3% of GDP in 2016, we expect the deficit to stand at a still-large 19.6% of GDP in 2017 and remain in double digits in 2018. The election of a new government should help to ease the deficit to about 6% of GDP by 2021. The large deficits of the present are mostly being financed by printing money; the money supply (M2) rose by 230% year on year in April, the highest rate on record. High inflation and an overvalued currency are eroding the relative value of domestic and external debt, making debt/GDP ratios unreliable indicators of fiscal stability.
There is considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing, mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA. As these items are excluded from the public debt statistics, the true size of total public liabilities is understated. In 2016 the government undertook a bond swap that saw about US$2.8bn of PDVSA debt due in 2017 pushed out to 2020. Even after this deal, we continue to see an extremely high risk of default, although the government has emphasised its commitment to pay, and we expect the next administration to follow through with its debt-servicing and repayment obligations.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
Monetary policy under the Banco Central de Venezuela (the central bank) will continue to be driven by the government's desire to keep real interest rates negative and to print money to finance large fiscal deficits. Amid extremely high inflation, we expect real rates to remain deeply negative in 2017-18. From 2019 our forecast of substantial currency and fiscal adjustment under a new government also implies a substantial tightening of monetary policy. We expect interest rates to rise sharply that year, declining only moderately thereafter.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Ongoing disruption to Venezuela's productive base and a collapse in consumer spending mean that, after a massive contraction in GDP in 2016 (estimated at 14%), we project a further contraction, of 7%, in 2017 (this represents a downward revision from last month, reflecting the effect on activity of ongoing widespread protests). We do not expect the government to make the necessary adjustments to bring about economic recovery, and expect recession to persist into 2019. Our forecast for a recovery in 2020-21 rests on our assumption of slightly higher oil prices, alongside a political transition that produces a combination of macroeconomic adjustment (supported by IMF financial assistance), and institutional and structural reform. However, reform will take time to bear fruit, given the scale of the recession, and our forecasts therefore imply only a partial rebound, after a decline in real GDP of nearly 30% in 2014-19.
After dropping by an estimated 20.2% in 2016, private consumption will contract further in 2017-18, reflecting the effect of soaring inflation on real wages, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will continue to contract sharply, reflecting the difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange, and remitting profits. Our forecast for a recovery in invest-ment in 2019-21 assumes a political transition, progress on long­delayed joint projects with Chinese firms in energy and-later in the forecast period-a pick-up in public-sector investment. Exports will continue to shrink in 2017 as oil production falls further, but will pick up in 2019-21, reflecting renewed investment under a new government and a removal of constraints to domestic production. Import demand will rise faster than exports, in line with an alleviation of basic goods shortages and the release of pent-up demand from recession. Even after the change in govern-ment, however, dependence on oil will persist.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
A decimation of domestic supply and severe shortages of foreign-exchange reserves have caused inflation to soar for much of the past two years, and in the short term there is little sign that the situation will improve, despite deep reces-sion. No new official inflation data have been released since end-2015, but since the start of the year the National Assembly has begun producing a consumer price index. This showed monthly inflation at 16.5% in April, bringing accumu-lated inflation for January-April to 92.8%. Assuming that price pressures remain high in the first half of 2017 at least, we expect average inflation to be higher this year, at 591%, than in 2016. However, we continue to forecast a decline in inflation over time, reflecting moderately higher oil prices, which will bring in the necessary foreign exchange to help to alleviate scarcity of goods, and the effect of persistent recession on demand. From 2019 fiscal and monetary policy adjustment will also be supportive of a gradual reduction in inflation towards double-digit levels (in year-on-year terms). However, for now, a lack of funds available for importing basic goods suggests that shortages will be rife, and the risk of hyperinflation (monthly inflation of over 50%) will remain substantial.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
Amid huge pressures on the dual-currency exchange-rate system, our forecasts assume substantial devaluations in 2017-18, but the exchange rate will still be extremely overvalued. The dual exchange-rate system is composed of an official peg, known as the Dipro, which is limited to priority public-sector imports and set at BsF10:US$1, and a heavily managed rate known as the Dicom. The government revamped the Dicom system at end-May, and at its first auction (two per week are planned) sold US$24.1m at Bs2,010:US$1, implying a 65% devaluation of the Dicom rate. However, the Dicom accounts for only 10% of all official transactions. In real terms, the average exchange rate (weighted by volume of transactions) has continued to appreciate, creating ever greater pressure for currency adjustment, the need for which is evident in the black-market rate; this stood at BsF6,100:US$1 in late May.
The pegged Dipro rate appears increasingly unsustainable, and we assume that the government will devalue the rate to BsF20:US$1 later this year and again in 2018 (to BsF400:US$1). We also assume that the government will increase the share of Dicom in foreign-currency transactions-in effect a maxi-devaluation. We assume that further major currency adjustment under a new, MUD-led government in 2019 will involve immediate exchange-rate unification. In the meantime, given existing distortions in the foreign-exchange market, there is an extremely high risk of a debilitating currency crisis in the short term. If confidence in the bolívar collapses amid hyperinflation, dollarisation-or the launch of a new domestic currency-could occur.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
The current-account deficit will narrow further in 2017, reflecting severe import compression and a moderate recovery in oil prices, which will outweigh a continued gradual decline in oil output. The deficit will widen thereafter, on the assumption that economic recovery draws in imports on a large scale after years of pent-up demand and in line with an easing of external financing constraints. Our assumption of economic adjustment in the medium term suggests some recovery in capital inflows, particularly into the oil sector. Together with IMF loans, this should help to rebuild reserves coverage, although our forecasts assume that even by the end of the forecast period in 2021, reserves will cover only slightly more than three months of goods and services imports.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The president, Mauricio Macri of the centre-right Propuesta Republicana (Pro), is pressing ahead with a programme of economic policy adjustment in an effort to eliminate distortions and return the economy to sustainable growth. The adjustment process is proving difficult, involving politically unpopular austerity measures, and the risk of social unrest will therefore remain significant for much of the forecast period.
Given the president's minority position in Congress, and the priority given to urgent macroeconomic reforms, there is likely to be only limited progress on the pursuit of legislation that would successfully address longstanding institutional weaknesses and structural constraints to growth. Comprehensive reforms to strengthen bureaucracy, reduce corruption or enhance the effectiveness and independence of the judiciary will be slow. Furthermore, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect meaningful advances-at least in the short term-on a structural reform agenda (incorporating tax and labour market reform) that could improve long-term potential growth rates.
After a contraction in real GDP in 2016, reflecting macroeconomic policy tightening and currency depreciation, we are forecasting a pick-up in exports, investment and private consumption in the medium term. There will be a boost in business confidence from policy tightening. Combined with macroeconomic adjustment, and a gradual removal of foreign-exchange and import controls, these policies should set the economy on a more solid long-term footing. However, some aspects of the policymaking environment will remain suboptimal, with labour-market reform and a comprehensive fiscal reform remaining low on the agenda.
Currency adjustment should gradually bolster the current account as a weaker peso starts to boost goods and services exports and rein in imports. On this basis, we expect the current-account deficit to narrow in 2017-21 from the 2016 peak. We also expect the country's ability to finance moderate current-account deficits to improve over the forecast period, assuming that capital inflows pick up as investor confidence in the Macri administration grows.
Argentina's GDP per head is still among the highest in the region and, combined with improved access to credit, moderate rates of economic growth in the medium term will boost purchasing power and create market opportunities. Still-high poverty rates and income inequality will restrict the pool of consumers, but to a lesser extent than in many other countries in the region.

Argentina's global business environment score improves substantially in 2017-21, and the country jumps 20 places in our global ranking. A period of economic policy adjustment is under way as the centre-right government works to tighten macroeconomic policy, reduce state intervention in the private sector and encourage private investment. However, in many areas improve-ments will take time to materialise.
Country forecast overview: Argentina's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: The administration of Mauricio Macri works to address key weaknesses, including weak competition policy, the heavy burden of red tape and restrictive price controls.
2019-21: Continued work to build confidence in legal and regulatory framework. State participation in key sectors continues.
Policy toward foreign investment
2017-18: Efforts to resolve any remaining disputes with international creditors and investors as the government seeks fresh sources of US dollar inflows.
2019-21: Foreign direct investment is welcome. Improvement made in investment dispute settlement and availability of investment-protection schemes.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Any remaining foreign-exchange controls likely to be removed. Continued efforts to improve the workings of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union) and develop closer relations with the Pacific Alliance.
2019-21: Possibility that free-trade agreements make better progress.
Taxes
2017-18: Further gradual reductions of export taxes to encourage domestic supply. Tax system remains complex and burdensome.
2019-21: Comprehensive tax reform to improve federal-provincial revenue a possibility, but obstacles to reform persist.
Financing
2017-18: Banking penetration remains weak and long-term credit restricted, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, owing to weak long-term deposit base.
2019-21: Non-bank financing grows, but is constrained by a relatively small pool of institutional investors.
The labour market
2017-18: Tension with unions, owing to inflation. Political and bargaining power of the unions will remain strong.
2019-21: Progress on labour reform unlikely. Continued potential for conflicts with unions. Some skills shortages.
Infrastructure
2017-18: The Macri administration works to address weak contract rights and deficient regulatory regimes, which keep private investment below potential. Financing constraints hamper public investment in the short term.
2019-21: Some public and private investment set to improve energy supply and upgrade export infrastructure, but the risk of energy shortages will persist as demand grows.

Background: Economic liberalisation in the 1990s drove firm growth, but an inflexible exchange-rate mechanism and fail-ure to deepen structural reform left the economy vulnerable to shocks, contributing to the collapse in 2001 of Fernando de la Rúa's centre-left government. An interim government took power until Néstor Kirchner of the Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party) began a term in 2003. He presided over an economic rebound, which enabled his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, to win the presidency in 2007 and secure re-election in 2011. Economic policy mismanage-ment drove a change of government in 2015, with a centre-right candidate, Mauricio Macri, taking office in December 2015.
Political structure: Democracy was restored to Argentina in 1983 after 50 years of instability and military regimes. A strong presidential system is in theory checked by a bicameral Congress, comprising a 257-member Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and a 72-member Senate (the upper house); in practice, however, the presidency dominates. The presidential term is four years. There are 23 provinces and the Buenos Aires federal district, each with its own government.
Policy issues: Pro-cyclical expansionary policies contributed to GDP growth of an annual average 6.6% in 2005-11. But expansionary policy also produced significant imbalances in the economy in the form of double-digit inflation, real peso appreciation and a deterioration of the balance of payments. Amid currency pressures, the Fernández government resorted to foreign-exchange, import and capital controls, as well as ad hoc interventionism, to the detriment of the business environment. These policies did not reduce devaluation speculation, and left the economy extremely vulnerable to currency crisis. Macroeconomic adjustments to reduce economic distortions and set the economy on a more solid long-term footing are taking place under Mr Macri; these include peso devaluation, and fiscal and monetary tightening. Microeconomic reforms to boost domestic supply are also getting under way.
Taxation: The value-added tax (VAT) rate is 21%, although VAT on some goods and services is charged at a lower rate of 10.5%, and some services are taxed at a higher rate of 27%. Corporate income tax is levied at 35%, and personal income tax at progressive rates between 9% and 35%. There is a 0.6% tax on financial transactions (deposits and withdrawals). Taxes on exports were reintroduced in 2002, and have since been expanded to account for around 20% of total revenue.
Foreign trade: The current account shifted from surplus to deficit in 2010. Despite comprehensive controls, there was a current-account deficit of 2.7% of GDP in 2015.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
The political scene is becoming more complicated as voter fatigue with austerity measures increases and patience with adjustment measures wears thin. An increase in obstructionism on the part of public-sector unions since March is unsurprising amid annual wage-bargaining negotiations that are taking place in the run-up to mid-term legislative elections in October. More of a concern for the president, Mauricio Macri of the centre-right Propuesta Republicana (Pro), is the continued perception among voters that adjustment is not bringing about obvious rapid improvements in the economy. Various economic indicators suggest that the economy is indeed emerging from recession, but consumers are not yet feeling the benefit in terms of higher real wages or increased employment.
The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect Mr Macri to change course and abandon the adjustment process that he has pursued since taking office for a four-year term in late 2015. This process has involved devaluation, fiscal and monetary tightening, and sharp tariff adjustments. In this environment, voter weariness with austerity, combined with the approach of mid-term legislative elections on October 22nd, will in the short term complicate relations with Congress, where the president lacks a majority. The ruling Cambiemos alliance, which includes the Pro and the centre-left Unión Cívica Radical, has to negotiate support for its legislative agenda in both houses of Congress on an ad hoc basis with the various factions of the large Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party). So far this support has mainly been forthcoming, not least because the Peronist party has had trouble regrouping under a clear leadership since it lost the presidency in 2015. The largest faction of the party, known as the Frente para la Victoria, has been weakened by a series of damaging corruption scandals, while moderate Peronists have frequently supported government legislation.
We expect obstructionism to increase amid election-related politicking surrounding a mid-term election in October 2017, and as a presidential election in October 2019 approaches. But mutual interest will ensure some continuing co-operation between Cambiemos and moderate Peronists. On top of this, a strong executive branch (the president has substantial powers to rule by decree) should provide Mr Macri with room for manoeuvre, even assuming that Congress becomes less co-operative. The president will also retain influence with powerful provincial governors, who largely control the agenda of the Senate (the upper house) but who are in turn deeply reliant on central government transfers, some of which are discretionary. As a result, we expect some continued progress on the govern-ment agenda. However, with electoral considerations coming into play, there will be limited progress on legislation that would successfully address long-standing institutional weaknesses and structural constraints to growth. Compre-hensive efforts to strengthen bureaucracy, reduce corruption or enhance the effectiveness and independence of the judiciary will be slow. We do not expect meaningful advances on a structural reform agenda.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
Mid-term elections are set for October 22nd. Open, nationwide primary elections will be held on August 13th, but, in practice, Argentina's political parties continue to choose their candidates via internal selection processes, and the primaries will therefore serve as a sort of dress rehearsal for the main event. With the primaries now approaching, campaigning is beginning to dominate the political scene. We expect the Peronists to remain the largest political force in Congress after the mid-terms, given their dominance of provincial politics and strong grassroots presence. The ruling Pro and its partners in the Cambiemos coalition are currently in a minority position in both houses of Congress, and we do not expect this to change in the mid-terms. For Cambiemos, a more important marker is whether it gains or loses seats, and how it performs on the Buenos Aires congressional list (voters select party lists; this gauges both how popular the political parties are and how popular the leading candidates on each list are). A good performance in Buenos Aires by the Pro, although mainly symbolic and not enough to provide a majority in Congress, would send a signal of the government's popularity. This is important because the dominant Peronist party would be much less likely to support the legislative agenda of an unpopular government.
The next presidential election is due in October 2019. Based on our assumption of moderate GDP growth and a return to single-digit inflation by then, we currently expect Mr Macri to win a second four-year term. There are substantial risks to this forecast, given the challenging external environment and the government's minority position in Congress. Reflecting the difficulties faced by minority governments in Argentina, no non-Peronist government has won a second consecutive term since the end of the military dictatorship in the 1980s. In this context, the emergence of a strong challenger from the moderate wing of the Peronist party is a substantial possibility and the election will be closely fought.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Efforts by the Macri administration to repair relations with trade and investment partners have achieved rapid results, and we expect relations with key trade partners in the region and elsewhere to remain strong. The Argentinian government will remain keen to seek trade deals under the auspices of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay; Venezuela was suspended from the group in 2016). The problem for Argentina and its Mercosur partners is that, just as the grouping has started to reverse its own protectionist tendencies, free trade has shifted off the political agenda not only in the US but also in Europe. Mr Macri recently visited Spain in an effort to drum up support for a deal, and negotiations are continuing. Our forecasts do not currently assume a successful conclusion of free-trade talks with the EU, but the workings of intra-Mercosur trade are likely to improve in the forecast period. Efforts at joining the Pacific Alliance, a regional trading bloc that includes Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico, may also make progress, although this is not currently reflected in our five-year economic forecasts.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
The Macri administration has made good initial progress on a programme of adjustment intended to put the economy on a sounder footing, having devalued the peso, reduced agricultural export duties and energy subsidies, and secured a deal with holdout creditors (allowing Argentina to exit default). However, macroeconomic adjustment remains incomplete, and policy efforts to reduce inflation will continue, in the form of tight fiscal and monetary policy and restraint in nominal wage growth. The latter in particular is proving a difficult political challenge, and has encountered stiff union resistance. The government is extremely unlikely to meet its goal of limiting nominal wage growth to 20% this year, but we do continue to expect nominal wages to trend downwards steadily from levels of above 30% in recent years. All of these measures should gradually engender price stability and ultimately boost investor confidence, although we do not expect inflation to fall to single-digit levels until 2019.
With macroeconomic adjustment measures proceeding apace, the government is gradually turning its attention to the structural reform agenda and to reforms to improve the business environment, and we expect a growing policy emphasis on these areas. The government has already passed new public-private partnership framework legislation that should facilitate an increase in infrastructure investment, along with reforms to reduce red-tape financing for small and medium-sized enterprises. The development of longer-term finance and the deepening of Argentina's currently shallow capital markets will be a priority. However, other aspects of the policymaking environ-ment will remain suboptimal, with progress on labour-market reform (to improve flexibility) or comprehensive fiscal and tax reform (to reduce costs and complexity) unlikely in the medium term amid political obstruction.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
Higher-than-expected revenue from a tax amnesty on undeclared foreign assets will bolster the fiscal accounts and allow the government to meet its target of narrowing the primary deficit to 3.9% of GDP in 2017, slightly below the 4.3% of GDP primary deficit registered in 2016. We expect the government's gradualist approach to fiscal tightening to continue in subsequent years, bringing the overall fiscal deficit down to a more manageable level of 3.4% of GDP by the end of the forecast period, by which time the primary deficit will have been brought to about 1% of GDP. The govern-ment has taken some important steps in the past 18 months to try to narrow the deficit, particularly by reducing costly subsidies and the public-sector payroll. Even so, in the light of recently announced income-tax breaks and increased transfers (to expand the social safety net), deficit reduction will be slow.
In the aftermath of the holdout deal, and assuming that there is progress on deficit reduction, the government's ability to finance moderate deficits without resorting to inflationary money printing will be much improved. A moderate public debt/GDP ratio (and low levels of external indebtedness), combined with the attractiveness of Argentina's still-high yields, should facilitate international bond issuance in 2017-21, following Argentina's exit from default earlier this year. In January the sovereign issued US$7bn in five- and ten-year global bonds. As a percentage of GDP, the public debt will stabilise at slightly under 50% in 2017-21.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
Notwithstanding a recent policy reversal, which saw the Banco Central de la República Argentina (BCRA, the central bank) lift the policy rate from 24.75% to 26.25% in April, we continue to expect fairly substantial rate cuts in the second half of 2017 and beyond. The policy rate is below the year-earlier peak of 38%, but inflation has been slow to come down amid a series of tariff increases, and inflation expectations have been rising as a result, to slightly over 21% at end-2017, well above the central bank's 12-17% target range for this year. The BCRA responded with what we expect to be a one-off rate rise to make its commitment to the newly implemented inflation-targeting framework clear. Assuming that monthly inflation starts to fall towards 1% on a consistent basis, we expect ample scope for renewed monetary easing from later this year.
The central bank has made it clear that it will prioritise monetary policy that is conducive to a reduction of inflation, and our forecasts assume moderately positive real interest rates in the medium term, consistent with a deepening of credit and the development of long-term lending. This forecast is supported by the shift to an inflation-targeting regime (with the target due to be lowered to 8-12% in 2018 and 5% in 2019), and by reduced political interference after a period of politicisation under the previous administration.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
After a contraction in real GDP of 2.3% in 2016, we expect a return to positive territory in 2017. But with Brazil likely to post barely positive growth in 2017 amid an escalating political crisis, manufacturing activity in Argentina will recover only moderately, limiting GDP growth to 2.5%. We currently expect the recovery to peak in 2018, with growth of 3.6%. However, the annual growth rate for that year masks an expected sequential deceleration in the second half of 2018, resulting from a projected weakening of Chinese import demand. By 2019, when we project a cyclical downturn in the US economy, real GDP growth in Argentina will slide back below 3%, before a modest recovery takes hold in 2020-21.
Our forecast for a relatively robust recovery in the medium term is based on the assumption that a combination of macroeconomic adjustment and improve-ments to the business environment will eventually have some beneficial impact on both export activity and domestic demand. An easing of inflation, combined with efforts by the Macri government to address the problem of legal and regulatory uncertainty and reduce red tape, should set the stage for renewed strong growth in fixed investment and private consumption, support-ing an acceleration of GDP growth. On the supply side, growth should be bolstered in 2017 and into the medium term by a positive outlook for agriculture, and for investment in both infrastructure (which should see construction activity accelerate rapidly) and energy, including renewables.
There are downside risks to our GDP forecasts, as attempts by the government to reduce economic distortions and engineer a smooth adjustment to a lower-inflation environment could prove extremely challenging, keeping both con-sump-tion and investment subdued for longer than we expect. However, there is also some upside risk, as investment could overtake expectations from 2017 once the gains from macro-economic adjustment materialise and depending on the success of efforts to improve the framework for doing business. However, even in this scenario, in the absence of deeper structural reform efforts than we currently envisage, the potential growth rate will remain closer to 3% than 4%.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
Consumer price inflation will decline steadily but gradually in the forecast period, from a rate of 29.4% in April (according to the Buenos Aires city price index). Although high, the April result does represent a steep fall from a peak of 44.4% in May 2016, which resulted from currency and tariff adjust-ments by the new administration. Assuming tight monetary and fiscal policy (spending will remain negative in real terms until 2018), the inflationary spike will prove transitory, and we expect gradual disinflation in the medium term, provided that domestic demand remains subdued relative to the boom years of 2004-11 and domestic supply strengthens on the back of an improved regulatory environ-ment for agricultural producers. The main risks to this forecast stem from possible failure to tighten fiscal policy as projected, a weaker than expected peso and the difficult process of reining in nominal wage growth. However, if the government is able to tackle the high level of wage indexation, there is also the potential for inflation to slow more than we currently project.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
The peso weakened modestly in late May and early June, reflecting modest contagion effects from Brazil's political crisis, but at Ps16.1:US$1 in early June, the currency was only slightly weaker than the end-2016 level of Ps15.9:US$1. We expect some further modest weakening of the peso in the rest of the five-year forecast period, particularly in 2017-18, as domestic interest rates decline and the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) continues a monetary tightening cycle. However, the positive outlook for portfolio and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows will be supportive of the currency, which will dampen depreciation pressure and produce some periods of real currency appreciation (as occurred in early 2017). In nominal terms, we expect the peso to end 2017 at Ps17.61:US$1 and 2021 at Ps23.38:US$1.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
As the terms of trade improve and a weaker peso gradually boosts goods and services exports, improvements in the trade and services accounts will cause the current-account deficit to narrow. From an estimated 2.6% of GDP in 2016, we expect the deficit to fall to an annual average of 1.1% of GDP in 2017-21. We also expect the country's ability to finance moderate current-account deficits to improve, assuming that portfolio and FDI inflows pick up as investor confidence grows. The result will be a rise in foreign reserves in nominal terms. Our forecasts currently assume FDI inflows averaging 2% of GDP in 2017-21, with foreign reserves equivalent to an annual average of just over eight months of import cover in the same period.

Abstract: [...]The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the election to be a three-horse race between the ÖVP, the SPÖ and the FPÖ, with the ÖVP currently best placed to emerge as the largest party in the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house of parliament). [...]the social partners have been involved in negotiations on issues such as public healthcare reform, opening Austria's labour market to workers from new EU member states and improving education. The changes allow for greater government involvement in the management of the firms. [...]the political composition of the nomination committee creates the potential for the selection of board members to become the subject of intra-coalition wrangling. According to the Austrian Nationalbank, in 2016 corporate bond issuance (volumes outstanding) rose by 3.8% in nominal terms, after a 3.6% rise in 2015.

Full text: Austria--highlights: Political outlook
An early election will take place in October 2017, called after the "grand coalition" government of the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) and the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) fell apart in May. The election will be a three-horse race between the coalition parties and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). The Economist Intelligence Unit sees a coalition including the FPÖ emerging from the election as the most likely scenario, which will push policy on issues such as immigration and integration to the right. The system of social partnerships, which has for decades ensured political and policy stability, is likely to fray further during the forecast period (2017-21), weighing on the efficiency of the policymaking and implementation processes.
Austria--highlights: Demographic outlook
Population (m) 2011 2016 2021
Total 8.4 8.6 8.7
 Male 4.1 4.2 4.3
 Female 4.3 4.4 4.4
Period averages (%)   2012-16 2017-21
Population growth   0.3 0.3
Working-age population growth   0.1 -0.1
Labour force growth   1.5 0.5
The population will grow at an annual average of 0.3% over the forecast period, supported above all by net migration. As in many other developed countries, the population will age. The share of the total population accounted for by people of working age is expected to decline slightly over the next five years. Immigration from eastern Europe will remain strong. The influx of migrants and refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, which pushed up the population figure in 2015, is not expected to be repeated. All three leading parties have called for restrictions on freedom of movement within the EU, albeit to different degrees, and we expect such calls to become stronger in the likely case of the FPÖ achieving a place in a new governing coalition in late 2017.

Austria's business environment will improve slightly in the forecast period, compared with the historical period (2012-16), helping it to rise by one place in both our global and regional rankings, to 18th and 11th respectively. The improvement is driven in large part by an improving financing environment and increased market opportunities as economic growth accelerates. The political environment, which is already less stable than many of its regional peers, will deteriorate further in the forecast period. However, the overall business environment remains relatively strong as infrastructure is of high quality, spending on research and development (R&D) is high, and the labour market continues to function relatively well.

After a relatively robust recovery from the global financial crisis in 2008-09, Austria has underperformed compared with its regional peers, notably Germany, with average growth of only 0.6% in 2012-15. Growth picked up in 2016, to 1.6%, and we expect another slight acceleration in 2017-18, to 1.7% on average, in part reflecting pent-up demand. Growth will moderate after that, to 1.4% on average in 2019-21. International competitiveness remains an issue and will continue to weigh on the outlook for export growth, as we expect little progress on reforms to address this. Nevertheless, a sizeable surplus on services exports, driven in large part by tourism, will keep the current account in surplus.

Austria is a wealthy country by international standards, with GDP per head well above the regional average. Household consumption growth has been subdued in recent years, and negative labour market trends and high savings rates mean that the country did not benefit as much from oil price-related real income gains in recent years as other countries. Throughout the forecast period the outlook for household incomes and consumption is more positive as the labour market recovers. An ageing demographic profile and a rise in the number of single-person households will continue to drive demand for housing, healthcare and leisure services. Income inequalities will remain lower than the regional average.

There is also potential for an improvement in productivity growth, with the government encouraging greater R&D activity and investment in education. Austria's large trade and investment exposure to central and eastern Europe will be a net positive for growth in the long term.

a Actual.
Background: Austria became an important force in central Europe with the formation of the Habsburg empire in the 15th century and remained so until the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the first world war. The Republic of Austria emerged in 1918. In 1938 Austria was incorporated into the German Third Reich. With the departure of the victorious Allied forces in 1955, it regained independence as a neutral country. In the post-war period Austria took great strides to catch up economically with the rest of the developed world and is now one of the most advanced nations. It is a member of the EU and a participant in the economic and monetary union (EMU).
Political structure: Austria is a federal republic and the head of state is the federal president. The government is led by the federal chancellor. The national parliament has two houses: the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house), of 62 members appointed by state parliaments, and the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house), which has 183 members elected by proportional representation. An early general election will be held on October 15th 2017.
Policy issues: The government's stated priorities are to reduce the budget deficit and debt pile, improve labour market participation rates, strengthen competitiveness, increase expenditure on research and development, continue to reform healthcare expenditure, stabilise the financial sector and raise educational standards. Progress on these issues will be modest at best, as tensions surrounding immigration, security and border controls will remain elevated across Europe, diverting attention to security and migration-related policy areas.
Taxation: According to the European Commission, Austrian labour tax as a percentage of GDP is the second-highest in the EU. A 2016 tax reform lowered the tax burden for low- and middle-income earners, but raised the top personal income tax rate from 50% to 55%. Social security contributions, shared between employers and employees, are high. Corporation tax is levied at a rate of 25%. Dividend and investment income is subject to a withholding tax of 27.5%. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a standard rate of 20%, and a reduced rate of 13% (raised from 10% in 2016) applies for certain goods and services.
Foreign trade: In 2016 the value of exported goods was US$142.8bn and the goods import bill was US$143bn. The services surplus, traditionally boosted by tourism receipts, was US$11.3bn. Along with a modest primary income deficit and significant secondary income deficit, this yielded a current-account surplus equivalent to 1.7% of GDP.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
The "grand coalition" of the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) and the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), which had been renewed at the general election in September 2013, fell apart in May 2017 following the resignation of the ÖVP vice-chancellor. The next election looks set to be a three-horse race between the SPÖ, the ÖVP and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). Although the FPÖ has been on the political scene for decades, support for the party increased sharply during the European migrant crisis in 2015-16. Neverthe-less, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the ÖVP to become the largest party after the election, driven in large part by the popularity of its young leader, the foreign minister, Sebastian Kurz. Several smaller parties will contest the election but these generally do not attract enough support to play a major role or to be able to make up the numbers for a majority coalition, which is likely to consist of the ÖVP and the FPÖ.

Political outlook: Political stability
Following several years of little progress on reforms, and coalition and party infighting, the grand coalition fell apart in May 2017 following the resignation of Reinhold Mitterlehner from the positions of vice-chancellor, minister for the economy and leader of the ÖVP, citing frustration within his own party. The popular 30-year-old Mr Kurz has taken over the leadership of the ÖVP. However, probably owing to the party's recent poor performance in the polls-it has languished in third place over the past year-Mr Kurz decided to leverage his own popularity by demanding full control over the party and that it would appear on the ballot as "List Sebastian Kurz-the New People's Party", which would also include people not previously associated with the ÖVP. Following Mr Kurz's arrival as party leader, the ÖVP shot to the top of the polls, pushing the opposition FPÖ to third place, from first. This "Kurz effect" could wane slightly in the coming months, as he will be forced to continue working in the dysfunctional coalition, will face increasing scrutiny of his policies and will need time to build new structures to lead a reformed ÖVP. As a result, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the election to be a three-horse race between the ÖVP, the SPÖ and the FPÖ, with the ÖVP currently best placed to emerge as the largest party in the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house of parliament).
Nevertheless, the election will be a next step in the fraying of the decades-long dominance of the political scene by the SPÖ and the ÖVP, as the latter will have been effectively replaced by Mr Kurz's new movement. The two parties have together ruled the country almost continuously since 1945, and a renewed grand coalition has become almost impossible following the breakdown of relations between the two parties and the gridlock in recent years. The FPÖ has profited from this and from concerns over immigration, although Mr Kurz looks to be drawing voters away from the FPÖ in large part based on his strong stance on immigration and border control.
The most likely coalition to emerge after the election is one led by the ÖVP, with the FPÖ as a junior coalition partner, as the other parties-including the Greens and NEOS, a liberal party-are unlikely to be large enough to help either the SPÖ or the ÖVP to reach a parliamentary majority. Risks to this outlook are high, as the election could turn and the coalition negotiations could falter because the FPÖ will probably demand significant concessions from Mr Kurz. Regardless of which coalition emerges, we expect political stability to deter-iorate further. The government will struggle to implement its policies, as the coalition partners are likely to disagree on economic matters, and the FPÖ is likely to struggle to translate its opposition on matters such as immigration and integration into concrete policy proposals.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
The state has a well-established division of power between its legislative, executive and judicial branches, all of which function well by international standards. The extent of interaction between the government and its social partners has varied over the past decade, but we expect this to become increasingly contentious during the forecast period (2017-21) as the post-war consensus continues to fray. Government decisions have occasionally bypassed the social partnership system (Sozialpartnerschaft), which establishes a co-operative relationship with trade unions and employers on aspects of economic policy-making. Membership of the Sozialpartnerschaft is compulsory and its role has been made explicit in law. On the whole, the social partners are encouraged by government to participate in drafting proposals and bills relating to specific issues. As a result, the social partners have been involved in negotiations on issues such as public healthcare reform, opening Austria's labour market to workers from new EU member states and improving education. The framework has tended to advantage the traditional main-stream parties and decreased in influence when the FPÖ was in government in 2000-05. As the chance of the FPÖ being included in government following the election in October 2017 is high, the influence of the Sozialpartnerschaft on shaping industrial relations is likely to diminish over the forecast period.
Austria's nine federal states (Länder) each have an elected legislature, a state government and a governor, but have fewer direct powers than states in some other federal countries, including Germany. A high proportion of tax revenue is collected at the federal level, although there is some pressure to increase fiscal federalism. Although spending is more decentralised, decision-making is largely concentrated at the federal level, with sub-national governments mainly tasked with the administration and implementation of programmes. The principle of finanzausgleich (fiscal equalisation) regulates the distribution of revenue at the federal level between the states. Co-ordination between the different layers of government is strong but also complex, and the lack of accountability and transparency contributes to inefficiencies in the fiscal framework and a high level of bureaucracy. In recent years several attempts have been made to reform this system but these have not led to noteworthy improvements and we do not expect a significant streamlining of policy-making and implementation processes.
Political outlook: Election watch
The next general election is scheduled for October 15th 2017. The most likely scenario is for the rebranded ÖVP under Mr Kurz to win the largest share of the vote, although not an outright majority, and subsequently to form a coalition with the FPÖ.
Elections for some state parliaments are planned for the first half of 2018. The next election for the primarily ceremonial post of federal president is in 2023.
Political outlook: Key players to watch
Christian Kern (SPÖ)
Mr Kern shot into the spotlight in May 2016 when the then federal chancellor, Werner Faymann, resigned and Mr Kern was nominated by his party to replace him. Originally a business journalist, Mr Kern moved through a position as spokesman for the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) to become the chief of the Austrian railways in 2010, a position that he held until becoming the federal chancellor in May 2016. Despite some hope at the time that he would be able to reinvigorate the grand coalition between the SPÖ and the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), especially after the parties presented a renewed agreement in early 2017, he was unable to hold the coalition together following the resignation of the ÖVP vice-chancellor, Reinhold Mitterlehner. Mr Kern will now run as the candidate for chancellor for the SPÖ in the election in October. He will emphasise his vision to modernise the country, which he set out in a plan presented earlier in 2017 called "Plan A". However, most opinion polls in May-June 2017 put Mr Kern and his party in second place, behind the ÖVP and Sebastian Kurz, the ÖVP leader.
Sebastian Kurz (ÖVP)
Mr Kurz is the charismatic leader of the ÖVP. He was appointed as foreign minister in 2013, becoming Europe's youngest at the age of 27. Although his appointment was initially met with scepticism in Austria, he quickly established a reputation as a competent and hard-working minister, building his profile by hosting high-level diplomatic talks in Vienna, the capital, for example on the Iran nuclear deal. His response to the European migrant crisis in 2015-16, when he co-ordinated the closure of the route through the Balkans for migrants entering Europe via Greece, cemented his position as the leader-in-waiting of the ÖVP, which itself struggled badly in competition with the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). He attached several conditions to taking over the leadership of the party, which included getting full control, rebranding it on the ballot as "List Sebastian Kurz-the New People's Party" and putting forward parliamentary candidates from outside the ÖVP. Polls conducted after he took over the leadership showed that his personal popularity pushed the party from third place to first. Mr Kurz will go into the election as the main candidate for the chancellorship.
Heinz-Christian Strache (FPÖ)
Mr Strache, the leader of the FPÖ, born in June 1969, has positioned his party as a more radical opposition force than it was before he took over the leadership in 2005. He has focused the party's agenda on a firm anti-EU, anti-immigration and law-and-order stance. The FPÖ is the largest opposition party in Austria and shot to first place in the polls in the wake of the European migrant crisis in 2015-16. Despite the FPÖ's often radical right-wing views, its strength in recent polls and elections, including in the presidential election in 2016 when its candidate made it to the second-round run-off, means that it is becoming increasingly difficult for the mainstream parties to ignore Mr Strache. The arrival of Mr Kurzwhom Mr Strache has accused of stealing the FPÖ's ideasas leader of the ÖVP has pushed the party down to third place in the polls. As another grand coalition looks almost impossible and the FPÖ remains relatively strong, it is highly likely that the FPÖ will be prominent in the coalition formation process after the next election. Mr Strache is therefore likely to remain at the forefront of the political scene in the coming years.
Political outlook: International relations
Austria was severely affected by the European migrant crisis, and this has been the dominant issue in its domestic politics and international relations since 2015. The country has been at the centre of many of the intra-EU spats regarding the bloc's response to the large influx of migrants, owing in part to its unilateral actions. Domestic pressure on the government to be seen as acting against this influx, and thus often against other EU member states, will remain high owing to the rise of the FPÖ, and it seems to have driven the government to lower its annual cap on asylum applications. The government has repeatedly hinted that it wants to limit labour migration within the EU, or at least give preferential treatment to Austrian citizens in the labour market, which will exacerbate tensions with many EU member states.
We expect a new government to continue along the same line, as most parties have supported such an approach. Although the previous inclusion of the FPÖ in government following the election in 1999 led to sanctions being imposed by other EU nations in 2000, we do not expect this to be repeated should it join the next governing coalition. Whereas at that time a far-right nationalist party entering government was a relatively unusual development, since then sister parties to the FPÖ have either entered government or supported minority governments in parliament in several EU countries, including several Nordic countries and the Netherlands.
The rerun of the presidential election in December 2016 demonstrated the relatively broad support for EU membership. Many voters cited as one of their main reasons for voting for Alexander Van der Bellen-the independent candidate running against Norbert Hofer, the FPÖ candidate-suggestions by Mr Hofer of a possible membership referendum in Austria if the EU did not reform or if Turkey joined. This experience should moderate any further attempts by the FPÖ to use the EU as a divisive issue.

Austria's population was estimated at 8.6m in 2016, an increase of around 300,000, or 3.6%, over the past decade. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a further rise to 8.7m by the end of the forecast period, in 2021. However, these figures slightly understate population growth in the past two years, as the UN data that we use for comparability across countries is not updated as regularly as the national source data. Natural change (more births than deaths) has been a contributor to population growth since the mid-1980s, but the main driver in recent years has been net migration. According to Statistics Austria, annual net immigration increased from 3,880 people in 1996 to a record 113,067 people in 2015. This was driven in large part by the sizeable intake of refugees in the second half of the year. As this movement came to a halt in the first half of 2016, the figure for 2016 was more in line with the years before 2015, at 64,676. We expect this source of population growth to be less pronounced in the coming years.
The share of foreign nationals in the population is relatively high
The share of registered foreign nationals in the total population is one of the highest in Europe, at just above 13% at the start of 2017, up from 7.4% in 2001. The high proportion of foreign nationals is related to the naturalisation process being longer than in many other EU countries, although the number of people granted citizenship has been increasing fairly rapidly since 2011. Around two-thirds of foreign nationals are from non-EU countries, with the majority from former Yugoslavia and Turkey. Measures limiting access to the Austrian labour market for citizens from the ten EU member states that joined in May 2004 were removed in April 2011. Restrictions on immigration from Romania and Bulgaria were removed in 2014. The government has suggested European-wide measures to limit migration but has so far been rebuffed by its European part-ners. We therefore expect inward migration to continue in the forecast period, mostly from newer member states and non-EU member states in the region.
Austria's population will age as it continues to grow slowly
As elsewhere in the developed world, the population will age owing to a low, albeit slightly increasing, fertility rate (at 1.48 children born per woman in 2016 compared with 1.41 in 2005). Nevertheless, we expect the population to grow by 0.3% in 2017-21, the same growth rate as in 2012-16. The ageing population is reflected in our forecast for average life expectancy, which is projected to rise from 80.9 years in 2012-16 to 81.9 years in 2017-21. The number of people aged under 15 is forecast to be unchanged relative to the total population between 2016 and 2021, at 14%. Over the same period the population aged 65 or over will rise from 19.1% to 20.2% of the total population. Highlighting the demographic challenge for the economy, the size of the working-age population will stagnate at around 5.7m as it declines by 0.1% on average in 2017-21.
Focus is on boosting labour force participation among older workers
Faced with a declining pool of young, skilled employees, policymakers have acknowledged the need to boost employment among older workers. Reforms of the state-run pension system are an example of this shift in policy, with one of the main aims being to reverse the long-standing trend towards early retirement. The effective retirement age is currently several years below the statutory level, particularly for men. Currently, retirement is possible from the age of 62 for men and from the age of 60 for women (subject to 37.5 years of contributions or credits). However, the legal retirement age for women will be gradually brought into line with that for men between 2024 and 2033. For each year that retirement is taken early-before the age of 65-the pension is lowered by 4.2%. Additional measures have been introduced to improve labour market opportunities for older workers (where employment levels at present are below the EU average), including employer incentives to retain and hire older employees, increased funding for re-training schemes and efforts by the Public Employment Service Austria to promote the employability of older workers. However, changing the attitudes of employers and employees will take time, and existing opportunities for early retirement are still being used extensively, which results in the unemployment rate for those aged 55 years and older being relatively low.

Austria's business environment score improves slightly between the historical period (2012-16) and the forecast period (2017-21), owing largely to improvements in financing, market opportunities and the macroeconomic environment. The country gains one place in the regional ranking, to 11th place, and one place in the global ranking, to 18th. Austria's strengths as a business location include stable political institutions (although this will deteriorate modestly), a system of social partnership that has facilitated wage moderation and good labour relations, and comparatively high spending on research and development (R&D).
Little progress on reforms is expected in the coming years
Austria's attractiveness as a business location will be held back by high taxes, a less stable political environment and restrictive regulations. Other issues include a lack of competition and excessive red tape in some markets, some opposition to foreign takeovers of domestic companies, and high business costs. The Austrian banking sector's profitability continued to recover in 2016, although this was driven by non-structural factors, such as further reductions in risk provisioning. The banking sector's geographical exposure to central and eastern Europe was further reduced in 2016, but remains substantial. Tighter regulatory requirements will support financial stability but will also affect profitability. Austria's reliance on the resilient German market for exports (accounting for 28% of exports in 2016) provides a solid foundation for export and economic growth. Austria's tax burden on labour income is the sixth highest in the OECD and The Economist Intelligence Unit expects only modest change on this front. We remain sceptical that tangible progress will be achieved to boost Austria's competitiveness during the forecast period. The election in October 2017 has increased the risks to the policy outlook more broadly, as it is likely to lead to the inclusion in government of the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ).
Business environment outlook: Austria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Government works on reducing red tape, but progress is likely to be limited. Barriers to entry to network industries are likely to persist.
2019-21: Modest strengthening of the competition authority's powers. Administrative reform reduces red tape. More transparency in antitrust proceedings. Risk of political interference in private firms in which state owns substantial stakes.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Foreign investment is generally welcome, but underlying opposition to takeovers of "national champions" persists.
2019-21: Possible erosion of barriers against foreign takeovers as a result of commercial pressure and EU legislation.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: No exchange controls. Foreign trade, governed by EU rules, should remain liberal. Progress on liberalisation of trade in services.
2019-21: EU likely to accelerate shift towards bilateral free-trade agreements as multilateral trade negotiations stagnate. Little progress on EU-US trade deal. Free-trade agreement between the EU and the UK.
Taxes
2017-18: No significant changes to the tax system, owing in part to a likely deterioration in government effectiveness.
2019-21: Some tax reform is likely assuming a government including the Freedom Party (FPÖ) takes power in 2017. Vested interests will continue to hamper large-scale reform and the high tax burden will remain.
Financing
2017-18: Financial stability to improve amid tighter regulatory requirements and a reduction in risk from exposure to central and eastern Europe. Credit conditions ease gradually as banks' profitability recovers.
2019-21: Introduction of systemic risk buffer of banks' risk-weighted assets. Further uptake in corporate bond issuance.
The labour market
2017-18: Economy-wide minimum wage is introduced. More stringent requirements for early retirement and invalidity pensions. Labour market slowly improves as increase in labour supply moderates and unemployment starts to drop.
2019-21: Continued expansion of labour supply, primarily via net immigration, but concerns about shortage of skilled employees in certain sectors are likely to persist. Early retirement phased out.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Further take-up of broadband services. Gradual improvement of transport links with eastern Europe.
2019-21: Improved transport network connecting main urban centres and providing better access to the country's interior. Gradual transition to low-carbon economy entails significant changes to electricity transmission infrastructure.

Owing to relatively poorer economic conditions else-where in the world, Austria climbs in the global ranking from 22nd to 15th place. However, in the regional ranking it remains in 8th. The risk of a serious escalation of the euro zone debt crisis has fallen significantly since mid-2012 following decisive pro-euro rhetoric by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the easing of the prospect of an imminent return of crisis conditions, after Greece secured a third bail-out in August 2015.
However, over the past five years the economy grew by only 0.8% on average per year. Although 2016 possibly marked the start of a period of catch-up growth, it remained relatively weak, at 1.6%. We expect real GDP growth of 1.8% in 2017, easing to 1.7% in 2018 and an average of 1.4% in the remainder of our five-year forecast period. There are some downside risks, especially relating to the uncertainty over euro zone growth after the vote by the UK to leave the EU and the potential impact of economic slowdowns in China in 2018 and the US in 2019.
Export competitiveness weakened in recent years
Sluggish economic reform progress and relatively high inflation (compared with the country's euro zone peers) have weakened Austrian export competitiveness. Therefore, export growth is likely to be below the country's potential. Austrian exporters hope to benefit from the ongoing recovery of the German economy-Austria's main export market.
Meanwhile, households' preference for saving rather than spending meant that in 2014-16 household consumption levels did not benefit from low oil prices as much as in many of Austria's European peers. Income tax reform in 2016 provided a moderate boost to consumption. However, the government has struggled to deliver some of the commitments made under its work programme and the early election makes any significant further progress unlikely. We expect any new government to struggle to implement significant growth-friendly structural reforms.
Macroeconomic stability will continue to benefit from relatively prudent fiscal policy and relatively benign public debt levels, benefiting from the clean-up and debt restructuring in late 2016 of Heta Asset Resolution (Heta), a "bad bank" that had been created to deal with the toxic assets of Hypo Group Alpe Adria (HGAA) in 2014. Austria will continue to record a current-account surplus, which will remain broadly stable in the coming years as a weakening trade balance is offset by strong tourism receipts.

Gradual simplification of regulations on the policy agenda
We expect the government to continue to attempt structural reform to raise the economy's potential growth rate, regardless of the composition of the new coalition from October 2017. Restrictive regulations and high admin-istrative costs continue to limit competition in some markets, particularly in the services sector (such as retail trade). Progress has been made in reducing barriers to the creation, and in supporting the growth, of small companies. A recent example is a reduction in the amount of capital needed to form a Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (GmbH; a company with limited liability), from EUR35,000 to EUR5,000 for the first ten years of its existence, which is more in line with the requirements in other EU countries.
Services trades and professions remain highly regulated
However, there is still considerable scope to reduce statutory and other regulations of services trades and professions. According to the OECD, the legal, broadcasting and accounting professions in Austria face a particularly high level of services trade restrictiveness. There is a high degree of state ownership and regulation in electricity generation and transmission, contributing to high network access prices and regional market concentration.
Despite improvements to the competition framework in recent years, there is still scope to strengthen the enforcement powers of the independent Federal Competition Authority (BWB). However, we expect only slow progress over the forecast period. Positively, the third EU energy liberalisation programme, imple-mented in 2009, should gradually lead to greater price transparency and higher customer mobility in the fields of electricity and gas. As part of these reforms, Austria is working to improve internal market mechanisms by unbundling transmission system operators from generation, production and supply.
The risk of political interference in private enterprise remains relatively high. On April 1st 2015 a new entity, Österreichische Bundes- und Industriebeteiligungen (ÖBIB), assumed responsibility for managing the Austrian state's holdings in several private companies, such as Telekom Austria and OMV, an oil producer. The changes allow for greater government involvement in the management of the firms. Moreover, the political composition of the nomination committee creates the potential for the selection of board members to become the subject of intra-coalition wrangling.
The retail sector has long been subject to heavy regulation, restricting the number and type of outlets, and hours of business. Although over the years there has been a significant liberalisation of shop opening hours, further liberalisation has faced opposition from a strong alliance between the trade unions and the Catholic Church, which wants to prevent shops from opening on Sundays and Catholic holidays.
In recent years there have been few privatisations of state-owned companies. The sale in 2008 of Austrian Airlines to Lufthansa, a German airline, was the most recent notable privatisation. Public opinion is generally sceptical towards privatisation. Nevertheless, several assets of HGAA have been sold off in recent years as part of its restructuring process, which was boosted in late 2016 by a clean-up and debt restructuring deal for Heta.
Austria's expenditure on R&D stood at 3.1% of GDP in 2016, up from 2.4% in 2005; this was well above the EU average of 2% (in 2015) and also above the EU target of 3% under the Europe 2020 strategy. Despite tight financing conditions in the private and public sectors, during the forecast period we expect Austria to move closer to its R&D target for 2020 of 3.76%.

Foreign investment will continue to be welcome
We expect Austria to continue to have a broadly welcoming attitude towards foreign direct investment (FDI). There are few specific restrictions on foreign ownership of companies and property, and regulations do not tend to discriminate between domestic and foreign-owned companies. There are no sectoral or geographic restrictions on FDI, but prospective foreign investors should be aware of strict environmental regulations and widespread concerns about the environmental impact of industry, which create some resistance to investment in the industrial sector.
Overall, Austria is open and welcoming to foreign investment, although there have been instances of protectionism and state intervention when facing the threat of a foreign takeover of a "national champion". This is the consequence of some negative experiences in the past. After Semperit, a tyre company, was taken over by Continental, a German group, the new owners moved the highly innovative R&D department to Germany, the machinery-paid for by the Austrian state-to the Czech Republic and closed down the Austrian factory. Only the brand name was kept. When a UK private equity group, CVC, raised a bid for a steelmaker, Böhler-Uddeholm in 2007, the government feared a loss of jobs through possible restructuring and engineered a takeover of Böhler by Voestalpine, an Austrian steel giant.
We expect Austria to maintain its close economic ties with central and east European countries, as opportunities in west European economies are limited owing to saturated markets. Austria will also retain its attractive position as a link between western, central and eastern Europe, which will continue to offer investment opportunities. Many Austrian firms distribute to central and east European countries at the wholesale level (although there remains significant room for improvement on transport links to the region). Many Austrian banks continue to operate significant networks in the region-despite some retrench-ment since the global financial crisis-and so can offer access to trade and investment financing for companies that want to do business in the area. However, exposure to central and eastern Europe entails risks, highlighted by ongoing concerns about political and security risks in Ukraine and tensions between the EU and Russia. Austria is among those countries with most to lose from a long-term decline in political re-lations with Russia, for example via finance, tourism, investment and construction channels.
The government has stated strong reservations about several of the EU's trade agreements that have been negotiated recently-including the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada-or are still under negotiation. Following the European migrant crisis in 2015-16 and struggles within the labour market to integrate the new migrant labour, the three largest political parties voiced reservations about the free movement of labour within the EU, and we expect Austria to remain an advocate for stricter rules surrounding this in the coming years.

Austria's foreign trade and exchange policy will be that of the EU
We expect Austria to remain a member of the EU (and the euro area) over the forecast period. The country's foreign trade and exchange policy will be that of the EU. There will be no exchange controls, and trade policy will be determined by the EU's commitments to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). National political pressures to prevent job losses through state aid may at times conflict with EU rules, but the EU is unlikely to attempt to reverse the market opening to most types of merchandise trade that has taken place under WTO auspices. We expect the EU to abide by WTO dispute arbitration. However, no progress has been made in the Doha round of world trade negotiations since 2008 and prospects for the round look poor. A less comprehensive agreement focusing on "trade facilitation"-particularly expediting the movement, release and clearance of goods-was reached at a WTO meeting in December 2013 and entered into force in February 2017 following its ratification by two-thirds of WTO members. Within the EU, no tariffs or quotas are permitted, and the EU has succeeded in abolishing most other non-tariff trade restrictions, such as health regulations that favour domestically produced goods.
In the absence of an international agreement, the EU will continue to sign bilateral trade agreements, such as CETA. However, potentially the biggest agreement could be with the US. Talks between the EU and the US on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) stalled in 2016 and we do not expect this agreement to go into effect during our five-year forecast period. The Austrian government generally supports free-trade agreements, but the government's programme for 2013-18 also states that Austria will continue to insist on the inclusion of social and ecological minimum standards in future EU trade and investment agreements.
The EU has a customs union with Turkey, includes Norway and Iceland in the European Economic Area (EEA), and has a range of bilateral agreements enabling free trade and other economic exchange with Switzerland. Agriculture is excluded from these arrangements. Outside agriculture, trade with non-EU countries is mostly subject to only moderate customs duties. The EU takes a liberal approach to trade in industrial goods. Average unweighted tariffs on these goods from "most-favoured nations", which cover most countries, are just below 4%. Although the EU occasionally takes controversial measures against alleged dumping, these have not undermined the broadly open regime and are unlikely to do so. A range of bilateral and regional agreements also provide for lower or zero tariffs and co-operation on non-tariff barriers.
The UK has decided to leave the EU in the forecast period. We expect the EU and the UK to reach at least a framework deal on the new trading relation-ship by the close of the two-year negotiating period, in March 2019. At that stage the UK will formally leave the single market, although the terms of the new relationship will be phased in gradually in order to minimise disruption. We expect the short- to medium-term impact of the Brexit vote to be an economic slowdown in the UK, weighing on exports and sentiment throughout the euro zone, and also affecting Austria, depressing GDP growth slightly.
Business environment outlook: Taxes

Since 2001 successive governments have made little progress in lowering Austria's relatively high tax burden (total tax and social security contributions). Personal tax rates in Austria are relatively high by international standards, with income taxes and social security contributions combining to produce high marginal tax rates, particularly among middle-income earners. In 2016 Austria had the sixth-highest tax wedge (a measure of the tax on labour income) among the 35 OECD member countries, with the average single worker in Austria facing a tax wedge of 47.1%, compared with the OECD average of 36%. The tax regime for companies is more favourable than that for individuals, with the standard rate of corporation tax at 25%. The actual (effective) tax burden faced by companies in Austria-after taking into account differences in countries' tax base definitions and varying levels of tax relief-compares favourably with the EU's east European members, despite many having lower standard corporation tax rates.
Progress on tax reform but the tax burden remains high
In July 2015 Austria's parliament enacted a major reform of the country's tax system (Steuerreformgesetz 2015/2016), which expands the progressive income tax scale for individuals to six brackets, ranging from 25% to 55% (previously 50%); the reform took effect from January 1st 2016. Social security contribution tax credits and the tax-exempt allowance for children have been raised. These changes and the restructuring of the tax brackets mean that the overall effect will be mild tax relief for most individuals. The reform package also raises the with-holding tax on dividends (profit distributions) paid to a foreign parent company from 25% to 27.5%, but this increase does not apply to withholding tax on savings interest. Real estate capital gains tax has also been raised. Despite the recent tax reform, Austria still has one of the highest bottom statutory tax rates in the OECD, at 25% in 2016, down from 36.5% previously.
Despite these reforms, there is scope for further simplification, with tax laws still subject to numerous special rules and exceptions that reduce their transparency and distort economic activity. The government wants environ-mental and health considerations to play a stronger role in taxation, including a higher vehicle insurance tax, a vehicle tax on polluting cars, and higher taxes on alcohol and tobacco. The 2015/16 tax reform reduces tax incentives for carbon dioxide (CO2) emitting company cars from 2016 onwards, and other tax incentives are available for non-CO2 emitting company cars.

Credit conditions are set to improve significantly compared with 2012-16. The banking sector's exposure in central, east and south-east Europe (CESEE) remains significant, having caused large write-downs in the wake of the global financial crisis. The transfer of ownership in UniCredit Bank Austria's CESEE subsidiaries to its Italian parent bank in the second half of 2016 has significantly reduced the Austrian banking system's foreign risk exposure. Nevertheless, exposure to CESEE remains a systemic risk.
Positively, the CESEE region's macrofinancial conditions and economic dynamics have improved significantly. The asset quality in the banking sectors in CESEE have strengthened markedly amid progress on the resolution of non-performing loans (NPLs) and increases in profitability. However, uncertainty about the duration and effects of economic sanctions by and against Russia in the wake of the Ukraine crisis will continue to weigh on the short-term pro-spects for the Austrian banking sector. Raiffeisen Bank International and Bank Austria have sizeable Russian units that are exposed to the risk of intensifying sanctions and recession in Russia.
Austrian banks' capital ratios have continued to improve, but remain slightly below regional peers. Tighter regulatory requirements will continue to support financial stability, but will also maintain downward pressure on profitability. In a comprehensive stress test conducted by the European Banking Authority (EBA) in 2014 only one bank-Österreichische Volksbanken-failed. The EBA stress tests performed in 2016, which only included the two largest Austrian banks (Erste Group Bank and Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich), showed that even in the adverse scenario, the two banks' capital positions remained above the supervisory benchmark.
Recovery in profitability, but some risks persist
According to the December 2016 financial stability report by the Austrian Nationalbank (the central bank), the Austrian banking sector's profitability continued to recover in 2016, although this was driven by non-structural factors, such as further reductions in risk provisioning. The restructuring of UniCredit Bank Austria has reduced the total size of the Austrian banking system's NPL portfolio. However, major NPL volumes persist at some remaining subsidiaries and remain a burden for their new lending and profitability.
Financial-sector supervision lies with the Financial Market Authority (FMA), the Austrian Nationalbank and the ECB. To rein in banking-sector risk, in 2011 the central bank announced new capital rules and lending curbs for banks. Banks are required to adhere to tighter capital requirements given full implementation of Basel III rules from 2013. The FMA recently introduced a systemic risk buffer of up to 2% of risk-weighted assets to be phased in over 2016-19, in addition to earlier macroprudential measures that focus on stronger local funding of Austrian banks' subsidiaries abroad and fewer foreign-currency loans. Banks are subject to a loan/deposit ratio ceiling of 110% for lending in CESEE, and are required to write "living wills" to prepare for potential crises.
Domestically, the clean-up of the troubled HGAA bank was boosted in late 2016 by a debt restructuring deal for Heta. In October 2016 creditors holding almost all of the outstanding bonds of Heta accepted a debt restructuring deal, reducing Heta's debt load and moving its ultimate liabilities from the province of Carinthia to the federal government.
Despite a shift towards greater reliance on equity capital since Austria's entry into the EU, the stockmarket plays a smaller role in financing domestic companies than in many EU countries, with the bulk of financing still obtained through bank loans. However, corporates have increasingly been able to issue bonds, thus reducing their dependence on bank financing. According to the Austrian Nationalbank, in 2016 corporate bond issuance (volumes outstanding) rose by 3.8% in nominal terms, after a 3.6% rise in 2015. This trend is likely to continue.

The labour market has turned a corner after years of rising unemployment
The labour market continues to function relatively well. With few restrictions on hiring and firing, it remains more flexible than the labour markets of many other EU countries. Labour participation levels exceed euro area and OECD averages, the workforce is well qualified and productivity is similar to that in Germany. This is partly attributable to a consensual system of social partnership, which continues to offer unions and employers a co-operative role in policymaking and has contributed to traditionally strong labour relations, although this system is coming under increasing pressure.
However, low labour market participation by older workers, women and migrants remains an issue. In recent years the labour market has not been able to integrate an increased labour supply caused partly by the influx of migrants; this pushed up the unemployment rate, even though employment had been growing. However, the unemployment rate never reached any-where near the levels seen in many peripheral European economies and the labour market seems to have turned a corner in early 2017, with the unemployment rate falling again as labour supply growth moderated.
Because of its ageing workforce, Austria will become increasingly dependent on immigration to avoid shortages of skilled labour. However, ensuring that skilled immigrants are employed in jobs suited to their qualifications will remain a challenge given large numbers of highly skilled immigrants in low-skilled work. To this end, the government is seeking to improve the process whereby migrants' foreign qualifications are recognised in Austria. This has become an even bigger challenge following the influx of a large number of migrants and refugees, peaking in 2015 with net immigration of 113,067, according to Statistics Austria-the highest level since at least 1961. In 2016 net immigration eased slightly, but remained substantial, at 64,676. The number of job-seekers among those with migration backgrounds has risen significantly, according to the Public Employment Service Austria. Net inward movement is likely to continue in coming years, albeit at lower levels than in 2015-16.

Transport links with southern and eastern neighbours need improvement
Austria benefits from excellent healthcare, telecommunications, transport and energy infrastructure. An extensive transport network provides good access to west European industrial centres. However, many aspects of Austria's transport links to its eastern and southern neighbours-although they have improved in recent years-require upgrades after years of underinvestment. This is particularly important in the light of the continuing rise in transit traffic (both east-west and north-south) through Austria, which is creating bottle-necks and raising environmental concerns about vehicle emissions. The co-alition government initially continued to implement the infrastructure projects announced by the previous government in its General Transport Plan for the period to 2025, but these have since been held back by financing difficulties given the substantial debt faced by the national road and rail authorities.
The infrastructure section in the government's programme for 2013-18 emphasises improving the interfaces between transport modes, in particular through the further development of freight terminals, stations, and park and ride facilities. Over the next 15 years investment to complete three large tunnels is estimated to total EUR50m-200m. In 2017 the government's infrastructure company, ASFiNAG, is investing EUR1.2bn in highways and expressways, with EUR530m going into new construction projects and EUR470m into renewal of existing roads and tunnels, and a further EUR200m is reserved for the construction of a state-of-the-art truck toll system.
Austria has a sophisticated telecoms network. Mobile telecommunications prices have fallen in recent years owing to increased competition, prompted by the entry of several new providers to the market. Internet services are well established and widespread, and fixed and mobile broadband subscriptions have grown strongly in recent years but remain above the levels seen in west and north European economies. Austria ranks highly for the range and sophistication of its online government services.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
Alongside the 2016 tax reform, which provided about EUR5bn in tax relief to households, government policy has focused on challenges facing the country's financial sector. These have included the clean-up and debt restructuring of Heta Asset Resolution (Heta), a "bad bank" that was created to deal with the toxic assets of Hypo Group Alpe Adria (HGAA). The uncertainty surrounding Heta was removed in October 2016 when creditors accepted a debt-restructuring deal. The government has also had to manage the banking sector's exposure to central and east European economies.
In its renegotiation of its coalition agreement in January 2017 the coalition decided on a number of measures that it hoped to implement before the end of its term, originally scheduled for October 2018. These included a new annual minimum wage of EUR21,000, as opposed to only sector-specific negotiated minimum wages, and reducing red tape for employers, including more flexible rules on working hours. However, although the coalition parties agreed to implement a number of these measures before the election in October, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects little progress, as both parties will be focused on the election and in the case of the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) on reforming the party itself.
The next government, which is likely to include the Freedom Party (FPÖ), will move integration and immigration policy further to the right, but we would expect it to struggle to implement significant structural reforms rapidly.

Budget balance -1.5 -1.3 -0.9 -0.8 -0.8 -0.5
Government debt 84.6 82.7 81.3 80.3 78.9 77.2

In 2014 Austria's fiscal accounts deteriorated, mainly reflecting the govern-ment's decision to create a bad bank to deal with HGAA's toxic assets. The fiscal deficit widened to the equivalent of 2.7% of GDP, from 1.3% in 2013, and public debt rose to 84.4% of GDP. Mainly in response to steady direct revenue growth, the deficit narrowed to 1% of GDP in 2015 but widened again in 2016, to 1.5%, owing in part to fiscally expansionary tax reforms and higher migrant-related public spending.
We expect the budget to remain in deficit throughout the forecast period (2017-21), albeit within 1% of GDP from 2018, as fiscal con-solidation will continue to be limited and growth solid but unspectacular. The public debt stock as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline gradually, from 84.6% in 2016, following a positive contribu-tion from the Heta deal, to about 77% in 2021. In the context of the quanti-tative easing (QE) undertaken by the European Central Bank (ECB) and Austria's relatively strong fundamentals, funding risks are extremely low in our view.

The euro zone economy is showing increasing momentum at present, and we expect another healthy expansion in the region's economy this year, after growth of 1.8% on average in 2015-16. Nonetheless, the ECB is continuing to pursue an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero, a series of so-called targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) aimed at pushing banks to lend more money and a EUR60bn per month QE programme, which will run until the end of 2017.
The ECB's president, Mario Draghi, stressed that the recent reduction in the pace of QE (from EUR80bn per month in March) was designed to sustain the bank's presence in the market for a longer period and should not be viewed as "tapering", which would signify a winding down of the programme. We expect tapering to begin in 2018, but downside risks to global growth during that year, including our forecast for an economic slowdown in China and tighter monetary policy in the US, suggest that the pace at which the ECB unwinds its accommodative policy stance will be gradual. We maintain our forecast that the ECB will not tighten policy rates before the end of our forecast period, in 2021.

Austria's initial recovery from the global financial crisis was respectable in the euro zone context, but subsequently the economy largely stalled and under-performed in comparison with regional peers, notably Germany, which was particularly striking given the traditionally high level of synchronisation between the two countries' business cycles. Real GDP rose by a sluggish 0.8% in 2015, and although it accelerated in 2016, to 1.6%, this remained below growth of 1.8% in Germany.
The economy's relatively lacklustre performance in recent years reflects a number of factors. Austria's domestic reform process has faltered and, along with higher inflation compared with its regional peers, this has weakened pro-ductivity and competitiveness, admittedly from fairly high levels, in relation to countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, hindering export performance. This has depressed labour market prospects. In recent years the labour market has not been able to integrate the increased labour supply, caused in part by the influx of migrants last year, and this has pushed up the unemployment rate, even though employment has been growing. This in turn has weighed on consumer sentiment, meaning that much of the windfall for consumers from low oil prices since late 2014 has been saved instead of consumed. Although inflation has picked up recently following increasing global energy prices and positive base effects, we expect continued moderate consumption growth owing to a modestly improving labour market.
We expect the current phase of catch-up growth-following an underperformance even compared with fundamentals in recent years-to continue, and we expect real GDP growth of 1.8% in 2017, broadly in line with regional peers. The lack of reform progress is likely to continue to weigh on growth throughout the forecast period. Domestic demand will be the main driver of growth, which is likely to converge towards potential growth in the coming years. We therefore expect average real GDP growth of just 1.5% in 2018-21.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Although its size has shrunk, industry still accounts for around 28% of GDP and remains an important driver of economic growth. After a steep contraction in 2009, the industrial sector bounced back fairly strongly as global trade volumes picked up, growing by an average of 3.2% per year in real terms in 2010-12. However, Austria's industrial sector could not escape the subsequent downturn in euro zone growth. Industrial growth averaged just 0.7% in 2013-15. The weaker performance of recent years has brought into sharp focus a relative decline in competitiveness compared with some euro zone peers, and Austrian exports have lost market share. Growth of value added in industry picked up to 1.7% in 2016 as Austrian industry profited from the uptick in fortunes in the euro zone and strong growth in central Europe. We expect industry to continue growing robustly in 2017-18 but for growth to moderate to around 1% in the second half of our forecast period.
Services dominate the Austrian economy, accounting for over 70% of GDP. Austria's two largest services sectors are financial services and tourism. Austrian banks' early move to establish a strong position in central and eastern Europe initially gave them a strategic advantage over other European competitors, although in the post-crisis years many of these investments have caused problems. These have now largely passed and the sector is looking increasingly healthy and able to contribute to growth in the coming years.
Austria's tourism sector is highly developed and large by international standards. In terms of international tourism receipts, the country ranks tenth in the world, accounting for over 1% of the global market, a huge share relative to the country's size (just over 0.1% of the world's population). Tourism has held up well in recent years, despite the euro zone crisis. The weakness of the Russian economy and the rouble have already seen the number of Russian visitors (who are often among the higher-spending tourists) drop, but overall we expect the Austrian tourism sector to remain strong during the forecast period, owing in part to other destinations, such as Turkey and Egypt, having become less attractive for European and Russian tourists. The government has made efforts to develop the tourism industry and has sought to diversify away from its traditional heavy reliance on Alpine summer and winter holidays. One area of growth in recent years has been "wellness tourism", with Austria's clean air, attractive environment and top-class facilities being strongly promoted as a favoured destination for health-related holidays. We expect growth of the services sector to continue closely tracking headline GDP growth, at 1.7% on average in 2017-21.
Agriculture will remain small as a percentage of GDP, but unlike in some other parts of western Europe it is not expected to shrink during the forecast period. Nevertheless, stronger growth in other sectors means that its share of GDP is set to fall slightly further in the coming years, to 1.2% by 2021, as we expect it to grow only by an average of 1.4% per year in 2017-21.

Annual consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) has been subdued in recent years, but higher than in most other euro zone countries. Inflation averaged 0.8% in 2015 and 1% in 2016-well above average inflation in Germany and the euro zone in both years. This largely reflects structural domestic factors, such as higher unit wage costs, more regulated markets and a period of faster increases in taxes and duties. Rising services prices, energy price base effects and the lagged feedthrough of euro weakness via import costs fostered a gradual rise in inflation from October 2016, and will continue to do so in the rest of 2017, when we forecast full-year average inflation of 2.2%. We expect inflation to stay above the euro zone average in 2018-21, at 2% on average, as similar structural factors as in previous years persist.

The euro has moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1 since mid-2015. The annual average exchange rate was US$1.11:EUR1 in 2016, although a sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following the presidential election in the US led to a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1. The euro has since rallied as the region's economic recovery has continued and political risk has waned. However, the common currency's resilience may be tested again in forthcoming elections, and faster economic growth and tighter monetary policy in the US will lend support to the dollar. We expect the exchange rate to average US$1.08:EUR1 in 2017-18, before appreciating gradually in 2019-21. We do not expect the euro to return to its long-term average value against the dollar even by the end of the forecast period.

Low oil prices and subdued domestic demand compressing import values helped the trade balance move into surplus in 2014-15, from a deficit in 2009-13. The recent recovery has pushed up imports and moved the trade balance back into a small deficit in 2016. We expect growth in domestic demand and a slight rise in oil prices to weigh on the trade balance in the coming years. However, this will be compensated for by a healthy surplus on the services balance, driven in large part by robust tourism inflows. We therefore expect continued current-account surpluses in our forecast period of just below 2% on average.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Austria
Stocks and flows
Inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) have risen steadily since Austria joined the EU. Although it remains one of the smaller hosts in western Europe in absolute terms, it has made substantial progress relative to the size of its economy. The stock of FDI increased significantly from the equivalent of 6.6% of GDP in 1994 (the year before Austria joined the EU) to 69.1% in 2016. FDI inflows posted a record of US$81.3bn in 2005, but have since dropped significantly, to -US$1.3bn on average in 2011-16. FDI outflows followed a similar pattern: after peaking at US$81.5bn in 2005 they stood at US$14.3bn (divestment) in 2010, before averaging US$8.3bn in 2011-16. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the stock of Austrian FDI abroad to rise gradually in the coming years, from US$316.2bn in 2016 (equivalent to 81.7% of GDP) to US$400.5bn (85.1% of GDP) at the end of the forecast period in 2021, and the stock of FDI in Austria is expected to rise gradually from US$267.3bn in 2015 (69.1% of GDP) to US$300bn (63.8% of GDP) at the end of the forecast period.
Origin and distribution
Companies in other EU member states have traditionally been the largest inward direct investors, accounting for over half of the inward FDI stock in 2016. Historically, most FDI comes from the EU15, in particular Germany, and Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have also been important sources of inflows. In terms of stock, Germany remains comfortably the biggest holder, with EUR41.7bn in 2015 (28.2% of the total), followed by Russia (EUR21.8bn; 14.7%) and Italy (EUR11.2bn; 7.6%). Central and south-eastern Europe remains an important destination for Austrian FDI outflows, although net outflows to this region were negative in 2016 as companies repatriated capital. This also led to a drop in the stock of outstanding investment in the region, to EUR56bn, from EUR61.7bn in 2015. The region now represents around 29% of the total stock of Austrian FDI, compared with 50% in 2008. Professional scientific and technical services activities, financial intermediation and trade were the sectors in Austria in which foreign investors had the most invested in 2016. The same was true for Austrian investors abroad, although financial intermediation was by some margin the largest sector for outward foreign investment.
Determinants
Austria's main strengths as a location for FDI are its central location within the EU's single market, its proximity to and historical ties with eastern Europe, its competitive corporation tax rate (25%), an educated and flexible workforce, an excellent labour relations record, advanced IT and telecommunications infrastructure, a growing emphasis on research and development (R&D), and a high quality of life. However, Austria receives low marks for its employers' high social security contributions, considerable levels of red tape, and delays in expanding road and rail infrastructure towards eastern Europe. Outward direct investment has been driven in large part by integration with other euro zone economies and by the opportunities provided by the opening up of eastern neighbours' economies, although growth in investment into the former has been stronger in recent years.
Impact
FDI has increased competitiveness by providing a boost to fixed capital formation and assisting in the diffusion of new technologies and best practice developed in multinational companies. Outward investment, particularly in the financial sector, has helped to promote growth in the banking sector and has diversified risks away from the euro zone, although there have been other problems associated with economies in central and eastern Europe, especially Hungary, Ukraine and Russia. Public opinion remains ambivalent towards inward investment, with some lingering opposition among Austrians to the sale of "national champions"-particularly in the manufacturing and energy sectors-to foreign investors.
Potential
Austria's strong links with Germany and central and eastern Europe have historically been viewed as a strength. During the economic crisis of 2008-09 these links were temporarily deemed a weakness, but as the German economy has become the main driver of economic growth in Europe in recent years Austrian firms have benefited. However, the exposure to central and eastern Europe has been much less beneficial since 2008-09, particularly given the widespread problems in the banking sectors in some countries. Exposure to Ukraine and Russia has also become problematic recently. Nevertheless, over the longer term growth in much of the region is expected comfortably to outpace that of western Europe, and Austrian companies' early move into the region gave them the advantage of establishing themselves as large and respected organisations. They are expected to benefit from this over the forecast period. Austria will be well positioned to remain an attractive bridge to central and eastern Europe. The government will continue to seek to attract companies to establish their regional headquarters in Austria, and the country's favourable corporate tax environment and advantages in terms of quality of life serve as a magnet to high-technology companies in the IT sector. However, a lack of competition in some service markets and the need to expand transport links to Austria's eastern neighbours will remain challenges over the forecast period.

Austria is a wealthy country by international standards. GDP per head measured on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis was US$51,105 in 2016, well above the EU average. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Austria's relative position to remain broadly unchanged over our forecast period (2017-21), owing to a slight pick-up in real GDP growth compared with the previous five years, at 1.6% on average in 2017-21, compared with 1.5% on average for the EU as a whole. As a result, at US$59,905 in 2021, its GDP per head on a PPP basis means that it will remain one of the continent's wealthiest countries.
Consumption growth will accelerate but remain modest
Private consumption growth will stay subdued in 2017-21, at 1.4% on average. However, this represents a strong acceleration compared with the previous five years, when it averaged just 0.3%. The improving labour market will help to push up incomes, and income tax reforms introduced at the start of 2016 are supporting after-tax incomes.
Austria is among the most advanced countries in the world in terms of its telecommunications and internet infrastructure. Total spending on IT should grow more than overall demand over the forecast period, reflecting the increased take-up of internet telephony, broadband and wireless services. The slight acceleration of economic growth and incomes will help to support demand for the latest innovative products, something on which Austria has at times slightly lagged some of its regional peers.
Robust consumption growth and high per head incomes are reflected in Austria's score in the market opportunities category of our business environ-ment rankings. Driven in large part by the improved economic outlook, its score improves sharply, from 4.9 to 5.8 over the forecast period. As a result, its global ranking improves from 42nd to 25th and the local ranking from 14th to 8th.

Population ageing will have an impact on spending patterns in 2017-21
Austria is a mature consumer market, but demographic trends will have a large influence on spending patterns over the forecast period. With a high (and rising) life expectancy and declining fertility rate, Austria's population is ageing. Although the total population is set to grow over the next decade and beyond, the proportion of those between 15 and 64 will drop slightly, and the share of the population over the age of 65 will rise. Austria's changing demographic profile, allied to sociological trends (such as the increase in single-person households), will continue to drive demand for housing, transport, communications, healthcare and leisure services. In general, income inequalities across Austria are lower than the west European average, which helps to support private consumption.

Initial conditions: Austria is a wealthy country. Compared with some other high-income countries, it saw fairly good productivity growth in the period up to 2008, owing to reforms enacted at the beginning of the 2000s. These reforms helped to strengthen the long-term sustainability of the state pension system, lower the tax burden and improve the competitiveness of Austrian companies. However, progress on reform has stalled in recent years, and trends in productivity have been fairly negative since 2010. A number of areas still require attention if Austria is to raise its long-term growth potential. These include increasing product and labour market flexibility, boosting labour force participation rates, raising education standards, reducing high drop-out rates in tertiary education, lowering the tax on labour, continued reform of the banking sector, and improving infrastructure links with the country's eastern neigh-bours. The Economist Intelligence Unit's core forecast assumes only limited progress in these areas in the coming years.
The working age population will shrink in 2017-50
Demographic trends: The total population should grow moderately, at an average of 0.1% per year until 2050, owing to immigration and higher life expectancy. However, as in other European economies, the population will age over the long-term forecast period. As a result, the working-age population will decline by an average of 0.4% per year over 2017-50, meaning that the share of the working-age population will decline from a 66.9% in 2016 to around 56% by 2050, thereby significantly increasing the old-age dependency ratio. To avoid a sizeable contraction in the workforce, Austria must raise its labour force participation rate, especially of older workers. This to some extent is being addressed by pension reforms that came into force at the beginning of 2014.
External conditions: Austria stands to benefit from the faster expected growth rates of the EU's newer member states in central and eastern Europe over the coming decades, given its strong trade links in the region. Trade relations are expected to be further enhanced as the new member states become more fully integrated. However, Austria will remain dependent on the older member states of the EU for its exports. Many of these countries share the same challenges that Austria faces, including a negative demographic outlook (albeit not as negative in most cases as in many of the new member states) and tepid productivity growth, and we expect growth this also to remain moderate.
Institutions and policy trends: Austria is a stable democracy with well-entrenched rule of law that has underpinned macroeconomic stability over recent decades. Since the second world war, politics has largely been conducted as a system of grand bargains between the centre right and the centre left, which led to a stable political environment and few sharp changes in policy. The system of social partnership, offering trade unions and employers co-operative roles in aspects of economic policymaking, plays an important part in ensuring political and social stability. Although this system is likely to decline in importance as the traditional mainstream parties remain under pressure, we expect the political system to remain relatively stable and institutions con-ducive to growth. Significant reforms in the early 2000s saw Austria attempt to liberalise sheltered sectors of the economy, privatise and slim down the public sector, and spur entrepreneurship. Liberalisation of the telecommunications sector has gone fairly well, but a high degree of state ownership and regulation remains in the electricity sector, and reforms of competition in the services sector have also been slow. The increasingly fluid political landscape has the potential to lead to limited reform in some areas, although some of this could be counterproductive, especially with regard to the free movement of labour and goods.
Economic performance will mirror that in much of the rest of the euro zone
Long-term performance: Overall, long-term prospects for the Austrian economy are broadly in line with much of the rest of the euro zone. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects real GDP per head to grow at an average of 1.2% in 2017-50. The demographic profile is not as challenging as for some other euro zone countries (notably Germany), but will nevertheless be a drag on long-term growth prospects. Continued progress on pensions, labour market and healthcare reform will be crucial in this regard. Greater competition in services would boost long-term growth prospects. Faced with global competition, increasing investment in education and improving the outcomes of research and development (R&D) activity will be crucial. There is now a stronger emphasis on R&D (Austria is third in the EU in terms of R&D spending as a percentage of GDP, at 3.1% in 2016), and education reform is aimed at accelerating the transition to a knowledge-based economy. A particular challenge will be raising the educational standards of second- and third-generation immigrants, and integrating the large numbers of recently arrived asylum-seekers into the labour market. An increase in the number of older workers should stimulate growth and employment in traditional sectors of the economy, but there may be a shortage of skilled labour in areas such as information and communications technology (ICT) and bio-technology.

Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported.
Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. Our long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also the key to understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. The Economist Intelligence Unit is well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions (based on cross-section, panel data for 86 countries for the 1970-2000 period) that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The sample is split into three decades: 1971-80, 1981-90 and 1991-2000. This gives a maximum of 258 observations (86 countries for each decade); given missing values for some countries and variables, the actual number of observations is 246. The estimation of the pooled, cross-section, panel data is conducted on the basis of a statistical technique called Seemingly Unrelated Regressions.
The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade in the 1970-2000 period.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
Control variables include PRIMARY: Share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: Percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: History of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in the 1970-2000 period.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income.
Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines ten separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, and infrastructure. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 16 (infrastructure), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2012-16) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2017-21). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2012-16. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2017-21 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
The main sources used in the business rankings model include CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce; Freedom House, Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties; Heritage Foundation, Index of Economic Freedom; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; UN, Human Development Report; US Social Security Administration, Social Security Programs Throughout the World; World Bank, World Development Report; World Development Indicators; Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Report.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2012-16 ranges are then used to derive 2017-21 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2017-21, not to the likely situation in 2021 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2014 or 2019). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Formal political opposition to the regime will remain marginal. Vladimir Putin, the president, is likely to run again for president in March 2018 and win with a large majority in the first round. The principal concern for the authorities will be to maintain a high turnout in the absence of a meaningful contest.
Donald Trump, the US president, has expressed a desire to improve relations with Russia, but the likelihood of a significant rapprochement has declined given the intense scrutiny of Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election campaign and of the Trump team's alleged links with Russian officials.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects US and EU sectoral sanctions on the Russian defence, energy and financial sectors to remain in place in the medium term. Russian counter sanctions on Western food imports will also remain in place indefinitely, but relations with Turkey have improved from a recent low and Russia has lifted its sanctions on Turkey.
Despite a reduction in fighting in Ukraine, we do not expect the Minsk II deal to lead to a comprehensive political settlement. Ukraine will not regain full control of its border with Russia.
Russia is likely to remain a mobilisation economy, characterised by high spending on the defence sector, a cautious approach to foreign investment in many sectors, protectionism and a large role for the state in the economy.
The government is unlikely to implement disruptive market reforms. Minority stakes in some major state enterprises will be sold off. Chinese companies are likely to take a bigger role in the economy, including in the extractive sector.
Despite pressure to maintain defence and welfare spending, the government will cut public expenditure in 2017-19 to keep the budget deficit under control. The budget deficit will narrow to less than 1% of GDP by 2021, from 3.4% of GDP in 2016.
The economy contracted by 0.2% in 2016. We forecast that the economy will grow by 1.6% in 2017, supported by higher oil prices and improving consumer confidence. Investment will remain relatively weak, and public spending will be tightened further.
The medium-term growth outlook will be constrained by structural weaknesses, including a lack of competition, high state involvement in the economy, an ageing and declining workforce, and weak rule of law. We forecast average annual GDP growth of 1.6% per year in 2017-21.

Russia falls by one place in our regional ranking in the forecast period (2017-21), to 14th out of 16 countries. This reflects manifold institutional weaknesses, poor rule of law, high levels of corruption and extensive state involve-ment in the economy. It falls to 68th out of 82 countries in our global ranking.
Country forecast overview: Russia's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Privatisation plans will proceed slowly, despite the announcement in 2016 of a new privatisation drive.
2019-21: Overall state involvement in the economy remains high. Government interference in private companies remains arbitrary. Rent-seeking officials remain a burden on business. Protection of intellectual property rights could weaken.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: International sanctions and low energy prices discourage major new investment in the oil and gas sectors.
2019-21: The "pivot to the east" will lead to further moderate growth in investment from Asia.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Western sanctions remain in place. Membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is effectively suspended. The Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) internal market is undermined by exemptions and weak enforcement.
2019-21: The difficulty of trading across borders continues to be a weakness. The Russian ban on Western agricultural imports is likely to remain in force.
Taxes
2017-18: The resources tax on gas and the tax on tobacco rise. The freeze on the tax on vodka is extended. Direct taxes on in-dividuals and value-added tax (VAT) will not be raised, and the government may issue VAT concessions to selected sectors.
2019-21: A progressive consumption tax might be introduced. Tax inspections remain a burden on business. The time that it takes to pay taxes is close to international norms. There are some specific improvements in the corporate tax regime.
Financing
2017-18: International sanctions limit access to external capital markets, significantly raising the cost of financing.
2019-21: International financial integration proceeds slowly. The banking system remains weak and state dominated. The government maintains its commitment to bail out systemically important institutions.
The labour market
2017-18: Spending on education is cut further. The incidence of strikes increases slightly, although the labour movement remains weak.
2019-21: The indigenous labour force will steadily decline; however, the impact will be offset in some sectors by continued substantial immigration from the Commonwealth of Independent States, much of it unskilled.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Budget constraints curb investment in infrastructure. Politically important projects are prioritised, but even here cuts are made. Russia struggles to obtain international funding for its infrastructure projects. Roads are starved of funding.
2019-21: It remains difficult to secure foreign finance. China provides only a limited alternative to Western funding.

Background: The transition to a market economy in the early 1990s was accompanied by a collapse in industrial production and a sharp drop in living standards. A contested privatisation process led to a highly concentrated ownership structure. Executive weakness and bureaucratic dysfunction contributed to a sharp decentralisation of power. After becoming president in 2000, Vladimir Putin sought to restore central control over the regions and tame independent corporate interests. Mr Putin presided over a period of strong economic growth in his first two terms. His re-election as president in 2012 has heralded the development of a more authoritarian domestic environment.
Political structure: Boris Yeltsin won the first democratic presidential election in June 1991 and was re-elected in July 1996. Repeated confrontations with the legislature culminated in the dissolution of parliament in September 1993 and a violent showdown the following month. The powers of the executive were greatly increased by a new constitution, adopted in 1993. Mr Putin was elected in March 2000 and re-elected for a second term in March 2004. Mr Putin's second term in office was characterised by increasing centralisation of the state. A loyal ally, Dmitry Medvedev, won the presidential election in March 2008 and took over in May of that year. Mr Putin returned to the presidency for a third term in May 2012. Following a constitutional change, his term will last six years, to 2018.
Policy issues: Mr Putin's third term as president has seen a greater emphasis on "conservative cultural values", anti-Westernism and great-power nationalism. The stand-off with the West is leading to a rollback of Russia's integration into the world economy. This is likely to strengthen further the state's role in the economy. Tit-for-tat sanctions have encouraged the government to focus on import substitution. The focus on curbing "foreign influence" on domestic politics is likely to endure, along with close controls on civil society, the internet and the media.
Taxation: Reforms since 2000 have aimed to rationalise the tax system and cut the number of taxes and the corporate tax burden. Changes to the tax regime in January 2001 included the introduction of a flat rate of personal income tax of 13% and a simplification of the administration of social security contributions. In 2004 the basic rate of value-added tax (VAT) was reduced from 20% to 18% and a regional 5% sales tax was abolished. The corporate tax rate was cut from 24% to 20% at the beginning of 2009. The government has pledged not to raise personal or consumption taxes before 2018.
Foreign trade: Mainly because of high international oil prices, export revenue has soared since 2000. Import growth picked up over the same period as a result of rising real incomes and real rouble appreciation. Merchandise exports totalled just over US$280bn in 2016 and imports were just over US$190bn. Oil and gas account for around two-thirds of Russia's exports, with metals contributing around one-tenth.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
Vladimir Putin's third presidential term, which began in 2012, has seen a shift towards "conservative cultural values", a more authoritarian political culture and more overt anti­Westernism. This has been further consolidated by Russia's confrontation with the West over Ukraine. Despite some pro-market rhetoric, economic policy has grown more statist and protectionist. The leadership will remain preoccupied by the need to insulate the economy and society from foreign-in particular Western-influence and the perceived threat of externally sponsored regime change. However, the regime is characterised by ideological flexibility and is more adaptable than many observers acknowledge. If the external environment allows (a major caveat), it is possible that the leadership will devote greater attention to domestic issues and welfare after the 2018 presidential election and attempt to implement a slightly more liberal economic agenda. Concern about political stability is likely to hold the government back from pursuing radical reform.
The forecast period (2017-21) is likely to be characterised by relatively slow growth in living standards, following a major decline in 2015-16 and further cuts in public expenditure in many areas. This contrasts sharply with the rapid growth achieved in Mr Putin's first decade in power and could have unpredict-able effects on stability in the medium term. However, there currently seems to be little desire for disruptive reform among the broader population, and the potential for mass protest or major political change from below appears to be low. Social controls have been tightened since 2012, and the opposition has been marginalised and demoralised. Protests regularly occur across the country, but these tend to be focused on single issues such as plans to clear Soviet-era housing blocks in the capital, Moscow; the cost for individuals and activists of collective action focused on broader political change is high. The government tends to respond constructively when confronted with specific economic grievances. A mixture of state support and administrative pressure will keep major enterprises operating in provincial industrial towns.
The regime is actively engaged in cadre renewal at many levels. Nevertheless, the political system leans heavily on the charismatic leadership and popularity of Mr Putin. There is therefore a risk of a rupture when he departs the political scene. The weakness of most political and legal institutions, as well as the person-alised, opaque governance system around Mr Putin, could present difficulties in managing an eventual presidential transition. Any successor is likely to come from the team around Mr Putin and will not herald a sharp change in the policy agenda. However, it could be difficult for any successor to build popular legitimacy given the weak economic outlook. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect a political transition in the forecast period. Speculation about an eventual succession strategy is likely to intensify soon after the 2018 presidential election, however, and this will further depress business confidence and raise political uncertainty.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
The next presidential election will take place in March 2018. We expect Mr Putin to contest the election and win by a wide margin in the first round. Aleksei Navalny, an anti-corruption blogger and nationalist opposition politician, will be barred from participating in the presidential election following a second conviction for defrauding Kirovles, a timber company. This suggests that the authorities intend to run a tightly controlled contest, offering voters no meaningful alternatives to Mr Putin. The main challenge for the authorities will be to prevent a sharp fall in turnout, which would throw doubt on the legitimacy of Mr Putin's popular mandate. This is one of the reasons behind the efforts to revitalise the regional leadership with the replacement of poorly performing governors.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
The Ukraine conflict has led to a sharp deterioration in Russia's relations with the West since 2014. In response to the conflict in Ukraine, the US and the EU have imposed sanctions on senior Russian officials and the Russian financial, energy and defence sectors. Russia has responded with a ban on almost all Western food imports.
The Minsk II ceasefire agreement, signed in February 2015, is highly unlikely to lead to a comprehensive political resolution of the conflict in Ukraine. The constitutional reform mandated by the agreement, which could formally embed Russia's proxies within Ukraine's political system, is politically toxic in Ukraine. In the highly unlikely event that it is passed, there is little chance that Russia will allow Ukraine to re-establish control of its side of the international border. Russia sees Ukrainian integration with the EU and NATO as a direct threat to its national interests. Russia will not step back from its long-term objective of preventing a pro-Western govern-ment from consolidating in Ukraine. The current status quo, of a regularly breached ceasefire with contained levels of fighting, appears likely to endure for several years.
It appears unlikely that relations with the US will improve under the presidency of Donald Trump. Allegations of Russian interference in the US presidential election are the subject of FBI and congressional investigations. Links between senior figures close to Mr Trump and Russian officials have been intensely scrutinised in the media, making it difficult for the administration to take measures perceived as offering concessions to Russia. Moreover, Mr Trump's decision to launch a strike on a Syrian airbase in early April has again set Russian and US policy on Syria-an area where Mr Trump's advisers had hoped to build co-operation-on divergent paths. We believe it likely that US and EU sanctions will be retained in the medium term. Russian counter sanctions on Western food imports are also likely to remain in place indefinitely.
Regardless of Mr Trump's stance, Russia's broader foreign policy will remain vehemently opposed to Western integration with the countries of the former Soviet Union. This also applies to former communist countries in Europe, such as Montenegro, whose NATO accession on June 5th was heavily criticised by Russia. Russia's policy towards its neighbours, and towards Ukraine in particular, will be an enduring source of tension with the West. Regime change in any country in Russia's immediate neighbourhood, particularly via popular uprising, would probably trigger a crisis in relations between Russia and the West.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
Economic reform will be subordinated to the imperatives of political stability and regime survival. We do not expect the government to move substantively towards liberalisation of the economy, and certainly not before the presidential election in March 2018, although some reform is possible thereafter.
A more likely scenario is that the government will seek incrementally to improve the efficiency of the system by replacing failing officials and bureau-crats and cracking down selectively on corruption. Following the presidential election the government is likely to extend the pension age and conduct a limited tax reform. Progress on strengthening the rule of law and protecting property rights is likely to be limited. The government will continue to sell minority stakes in some major state-controlled assets. However, as with the sale in December 2016 of a 19.5% stake in Rosneft, a Russian oil giant, the govern-ment's priority is to raise budget revenue rather than increasing the level of competition in the economy or reducing state influence over it.
Russia's stand-off with the West has strengthened statist and protectionist trends within the government. Economic sovereignty-understood as insulating the economy from external shocks-will remain a strategic priority. The main elements of this strategy include a large positive sovereign external asset position (low public debt combined with substantial foreign-exchange reserves), protectionist measures to encourage import substitution and support domestic manufacturing, and a cautious approach to globalisation and foreign investment (which in "strategic sectors" such as the extractive sector is likely to be permitted only in partnership with state-controlled companies).
Some policymakers have urged a further increase in state intervention in the economy, along with capital controls, expansionist monetary policy and a return to a fixed exchange rate. We believe that the government will continue to pursue a mixed approach, observing the broad tenets of a market economy and avoiding disruptive reforms and excessive market-distorting behaviour (such as exchange or capital controls) while maintaining a large state role in the economy. We expect formal and informal barriers to external trade to remain significant.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
The government faces tight budget constraints as a result of international sanctions, low commodity prices and the reluctance of Western banks to handle international bond issuances (although Russia succeeded in placing two Eurobonds in 2016). In 2016 the deficit was the equivalent of 3.4% of GDP; however, this included extraordinary income from the sale of a stake in Rosneft in December last year. Without this, the deficit would have exceeded 4% of GDP.
Under the government's initial budget for 2017, spending will fall from Rb16.4trn (US$276bn) in 2016 to Rb16.2trn, broadly in line with the Ministry of Finance's proposal that nominal spending be frozen for the next three years. Based on an average oil price of US$40/barrel in 2017, the govern-ment expects revenue to rise by 1.8%.
As anticipated, the government is now planning revisions in the light of higher average oil prices. Anton Siluanov, the minister of finance, has suggested that expenditure could rise by Rb200bn (US$3.6bn) compared with the original budget, and that the budget deficit target could be reduced to 2% of GDP, from 3.2% previously. We forecast a significantly higher oil price than set out in the original budget, of US$54/b, and a budget deficit of 2.2% of GDP this year, allowing for slightly higher additional spending than currently proposed by the finance ministry.
We expect the finance ministry to continue to trim the deficit in 2018-21, but the adjustment to expenditure is likely to be less radical than planned, particularly given the forthcoming presidential election. We believe that the government is unlikely to hold expenditure fixed in nominal terms in 2018-19 as planned, although spending will still decline in real terms. We forecast that the deficit will narrow to less than 1% of GDP by 2021.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
At its meeting in April the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) cut its policy rate by 50 basis points, to 9.25%. This was the central bank's second cut in as many months. The strong rouble, driven by higher oil prices and the carry trade, has helped to push disinflation ahead of the CBR's expectations. We expect the CBR to reduce its policy rate to 8-8.5% by the end of the year. We expect further loosening of monetary policy in 2018. With inflation now almost at the CBR's 4% target, the central bank governor, Elvira Nabiullina, has suggested that an appropriate level for the real interest rate would be about 2.5-3%.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Russia's growth was decelerating even before 2014, as it ran into structural constraints. The economy experienced a sharp recession in 2015 as a result of the fall in the oil price, and real household incomes declined by almost 20%. The Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) now estimates that the economy contracted by 2.8% in 2015 and 0.2% in 2016.
The outlook for 2017 will depend on the path of household consumption. We expect real wage growth to pick up this year, to about 3%. Following a sharp decline in US dollar incomes in 2015-16, however, household consumption is likely to remain subdued. Retail sales volumes grew by 2.4% quarter on quarter in January-March (seasonally adjusted), but continued to contract in year-on-year terms. Leading indicators for manufacturing fell back in April, but the services sector purchasing managers' index remained strong.
Fiscal consolidation will continue to constrain public consumption and infrastructure spending. We expect a weak recovery in investment, after three years of contraction. Corporate deleveraging will slow and external financing conditions are likely to improve marginally. A relaxation of Western sanctions-not our core forecast-would provide a modest boost to investment. However, perceptions of political risk would remain high, limiting foreign direct investment (FDI) outside the commodities sector. An upswing in regional growth should lead to continued export growth, but at a slower pace than in 2016, as oil production is forecast to be flat. We forecast real GDP growth of 1.6% this year, with risks oriented to the downside, as household consumption might be weaker than currently projected.
The stabilisation of the economy should allow continued growth in investment in 2018, although it will remain relatively weak. We forecast a slowdown in China in 2018, which will hit Russia's terms of trade, and we expect Russia's growth rate to moderate slightly, to 1.5%. The public sector will remain a drag on domestic demand.
In the medium term outdated capital stock, a declining workforce, dependence on natural-resource sectors, institutional weaknesses, low investment and statist policies will limit real GDP growth. We forecast that real GDP growth will average about 1.6% per year in 2018-21, in line with CBR estimates of Russia's trend growth under the current institutional and macroeconomic framework. There currently seems to be little prospect of far-reaching domestic institutional reform. High political risk and the poor business environment will continue to depress investment below the level needed to develop a higher trend growth rate. The declining workforce will also be a constraint on headline growth, although in some sectors this will be offset by continued high immigration from the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
Inflation stood at 5.4% year on year in December 2016, but fell to 4.1% in April 2017, and remained at this level in May, meaning that the CBR has almost achieved its inflation target more than six months ahead of schedule. Disinflation has been assisted by a strong harvest last year and the appreciation of the rouble. Both factors could prove to be temporary, given that the strong rouble is in part due to the carry trade, which will unwind as the CBR continues to loosen monetary policy. We forecast that consumer price inflation will average 4.1% in 2017. The slowdown in China will lead to a modest depreciation of the rouble in 2018, but external inflationary pressures are likely to be relatively low. Tax changes in 2019 are expected to push up inflation to 4.9% in that year. Overall, we expect inflation to remain close to-but slightly above-target in the medium term.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
Higher oil prices and relatively tight monetary policy, which has boosted the carry trade, has led to a significant appreciation of the rouble against the US dollar. In early June the rouble stood at Rb56.7:US$1. We expect the rouble to depreciate moderately from this level in the second half of 2017 as the CBR gradually loosens monetary policy. The rouble is highly correlated with the oil price, and any rapid fall in the oil price could lead to renewed exchange-rate volatility. We forecast an average exchange rate of Rb59.1:US$1 in 2017. Our forecast growth slowdown in China in 2018 will hit Russia's terms of trade, and we have reduced our 2018 oil price forecast to US$55/b, from US$60/b previously, further reinforcing our expectation that the rouble will depreciate slightly in that year. Oil prices are forecast to be broadly stable around US$60/b in 2019-21, and therefore we do not anticipate significant movements in the rouble-dollar exchange rate.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
We forecast an increased current-account surplus in 2017 as higher oil prices boost the value of exports. This will be tempered by higher imports as domestic demand and investment pick up, alongside increased outflows on the primary and secondary accounts. We expect the current account to remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, but a further recovery in imports and investment will gradually reduce the size as a share of GDP. International sanctions and political uncertainty will depress FDI and portfolio inflows, although we expect these to recover in 2018-21.

Abstract: Under the AKP, Turkey is moving towards a presidential system of government, which will come into effect by late 2019. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved. The central bank has raised most of its main policy rates since November 2016 and has increasingly provided funding to the banking sector at its previously little used "late liquidity window" overnight lending rate, which was gradually raised by a total of 250 basis points, to 12.25%, in late April. Since November 2016 the weighted average cost of the central bank's funds to the banking system has risen, from 7.8% to about 12% at end-May 2017. 2012a 2013a 2014a 2015a 2016b 2017c 2018c 2019c 2020c 2021c The labour market (av) Labour force (m) 26.1 27.0 28.8 29.7 30.5 31.2 31.7 32.3 33.1 33.8 Labour force (% change) 2.1 3.5 6.4 3.1 3.0 2.2 1.7 1.7 2.4 2.4 Employment (m) 23.9 24.6 25.9 26.6 27.2 27.6 28.1 28.7 29.4 30.2 Employment (% change) 2.9 2.8 5.4 2.7 2.2 1.4 2.0 2.0 2.5 2.8 Unemployment (m) 2.2 2.4 2.9 3.0 3.3 3.6 3.6 3.6 3.6 3.6 Unemployment rate (%) 8.5 9.1 10.0 10.3 10.9 11.6 11.3 11.1 11.0 10.6 Wage and price inflation (% except labour costs per hour) Consumer prices (av) 8.9 7.5 8.9 7.7 7.8a 10.1 7.8 6.4 5.7 5.2 Consumer prices (year-end) 6.3 7.5 8.3 8.9 8.5a 8.6 7.6 6.0 5.3 5.0 Producer prices (av) 6.1 4.5 10.2 5.3 4.3a 13.9 9.7 8.5 7.5 5.5 GDP deflator (av) 7.4 6.3 7.4 7.8 7.7a 9.1 8.0 6.5 6.0 5.6 Private consumption deflator (av) 7.8 6.1 7.7 7.7 6.8a 10.3 8.3 7.1 6.2 5.7 Government consumption deflator (av) 9.3 6.0 9.4 8.1 9.8a 10.1 7.8 6.4 5.7 5.2 Fixed investment deflator (av) 6.6 5.8 9.0 7.6 7.7a 6.0 5.5 5.0 5.0 5.0 Average nominal wages 15.6b 14.4b 15.5b 13.7b 15.9 11.5 10.0 9.0 8.3 7.7 Average real wages 6.1b 6.5b 6.1b 5.6b 7.5 1.3 2.1 2.5 2.4 2.4 Unit labour costs (TL-based; av)d 15.9b 10.9b 18.2b 12.7b 17.6 12.0 11.3 10.0 9.1 9.0 Unit labour costs (US$-based)d 8.1b 4.7b 2.8b -9.4b 5.9 -6.7 9.3 7.1 7.6 8.1 Labour costs per hour (TL)d 7.5b 8.6b 10.0b 11.3b 13.1 14.6 16.1 17.5 19.0 20.5 Labour costs per hour (US$) 4.2b 4.5b 4.5b 4.2b 4.3 4.0 4.4 4.6 4.9 5.3 a Actual.b Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.c Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts.d Manufacturing only: public and private sectors.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The intense political instability in Turkey that followed the failed coup by parts of the military in July 2016 has eased partially since the approval in a referendum in April 2017 of a set of constitutional changes designed to replace Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidency. However, the presidential reform provides few checks and balances on the powers of the president and moves the country closer to one-man rule by the incumbent, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. This will further undermine Turkey's already fragile democratic institutions and governance structures; exacerbate the deep social and political polarisation of the country; damage the country's already fragile international relations, especially with the EU; and delay further economic reform efforts.
The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast is that Mr Erdogan and the Justice and Development Party (AKP) will win the next presidential and parliamentary elections, completing the transfer of executive powers to Mr Erdogan. The elections are not due to be held until late 2019, but they could be called earlier-once the institutions and instruments of the new presidential system are in place-if Mr Erdogan decides to accelerate the transfer of executive powers to the presidency. Emergency rule, which was introduced following the failed coup, will continue to be used to silence government critics and disable the pro-Kurdish opposition. Emergency rule will remain in place until at least late July 2017, and probably beyond.
Turkey is vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and jihadi extremists affiliated with Islamic State (IS). Turkey risks be-coming mired in the Syrian conflict, following the deployment of Turkish troops to Syria to combat IS and to halt the territorial expansion by Syrian Kurds.
The current direction of policy appears to be towards a difficult balancing act between fiscal loosening and tight monetary policy while encouraging banks to lend to households and businesses. Political pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey to cut interest rates to boost the economy has eased, but we expect that it will have to keep monetary policy tight in order to lower inflation and prevent a further depreciation of the lira amid expectations of higher US interest rates.
We expect average annual real GDP growth to accelerate slightly, from 3% in 2016 to 3.2% in 2017-18 and a still moderate 3.7% annual average in 2019-21. The current-account deficit has narrowed, but will still be difficult to fund, especially if global liquidity is tightened.

Our business environment score for Turkey deteriorates slightly in the forecast period and the country's global ranking deteriorates by 12 places, reflecting the absence of reforms in recent years. Turkey lags most central and east European countries for foreign direct investment. The main shortcomings are a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Privatisations are likely to be delayed amid the post-coup upheaval in the state institutions. Some companies, notably those with media holdings or ties with the Gulenist movement, remain subject to heavy-handed state intervention.
2019-21: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in a wide range of sectors, although the opening-up of the energy market makes progress.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2019-21: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Capital controls are not considered. There is a boost to trade following the lifting of Russian sanctions. Possible increase in protectionism under the new US administration.
2019-21: Customs union with the EU could be extended, but negotiations are likely to be protracted given the deterioration in Turkish-EU relations. More free-trade agreements might come into force with the EU's trading partners.
Taxes
2017-18: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make some progress. Tax rates are largely unchanged.
2019-21: A broader income tax base as exemptions and exceptions are reduced. Possible tax cuts and increased incentives.
Financing
2017-18: Monetary policy remains cautious amid concern about a possible deterioration in credit quality. The Central Bank of Turkey and commercial banks remain under political pressure to keep interest rates low.
2019-21: The banking system remains stable, despite some weaknesses. Heavy reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2017-18: Labour market remains rigid, with relatively high costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment. A 30% minimum wage rise in 2016 could damage competitiveness. Obstacles to employing foreigners ease.
2019-21: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Progress, albeit slow, continues on investment plans in energy, transport and communications.
2019-21: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. The construction of major airport and urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks could persist.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West, becoming a member of the Council of Europe (1949) and NATO (1952), and signing an association agreement with the then European Community (1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened under the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but the coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey has a unicameral parliamentary system of government with parliament elected for a four-year term. To win seats parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Under the AKP, Turkey is moving towards a presidential system of government, which will come into effect by late 2019. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability is Turkey's biggest policy challenge. Fiscal policy has remained prudent, but large external financing needs and changing global liquidity conditions will require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy relatively tight to attract adequate capital inflows. The Kurdish problem, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is one of Turkey's most pressing political issues, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015 and there has been a resurgence in violence. The failed coup highlighted long-standing institutional weaknesses, which, with the AKP's consent until 2013, allowed the secretive Gulenist movement to infiltrate the state. Further politicisation of the judiciary is likely after the coup attempt. Corruption and patronage remain widespread.
Taxation: The basic rate of corporation tax is 20%. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Tax reform to reduce evasion was one of the main elements of previous IMF reform programmes but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2016 goods exports (fob) came to US$150.2bn and imports (fob) to US$191bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$40.8bn-a contraction from US$48.1bn in 2015. The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
The intense political instability in Turkey that followed the failed coup by parts of the military in July 2016 has eased partially since the approval in a referendum in April 2017 of a set of constitutional changes designed to replace Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidency. Household, business and investor sentiment has improved and the economy has continued to recover. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit maintains its negative medium-term political outlook for Turkey. The presidential reform provides few checks and balances on the powers of the president and moves the country closer to one-man rule by the incumbent, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. This will further undermine Turkey's already fragile democratic institutions and governance structures; exacerbate the deep social and political polarisation of the country; damage the country's already fragile international relations, especially with the EU; and delay further economic reform efforts.
The narrow margin of victory in the referendum, allegations of vote fraud and bids to nullify the referendum have prompted Mr Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) to tighten their grip on power. Following the referendum the government extended the state of emergency law until late July 2017. Emergency rule, which has been repeatedly extended on a three-month basis since its introduction in response to the failed coup, effectively allows Mr Erdogan to govern as a president with executive powers until the new system of government is fully in place, after the presidential and parliamentary elections, scheduled for 2019.
Emergency rule was initially introduced to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. However, the use of these powers has been extended to eliminate the pro-Kurdish political opposition, which the government accuses of having links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). More than 100,000 people-mainly in the judiciary, the military, the police, academic institutions and the media-have so far been suspended, dismissed or detained.
Security risk will remain high, with negative implications for the economy. The state is seeking to end an insurgency by the PKK in the south-east of Turkey, address the domestic security risk posed by terrorist attacks by Kurdish militants and Islamic State (IS) in cities across the country, and implement military operations in Syria and Iraq against both IS and the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds. The purge of the Turkish armed forces and the police since the attempted coup has created operational capacity problems and contributed to intelligence failures that have exacerbated Turkey's domestic security issues. In the short to medium term neither the government nor the PKK appears to be interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will intensify.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
The next parliamentary and presidential elections are due to be held in 2019, but they could be called earlier, once the institutions and instruments of the new presidential system are in place, if Mr Erdogan decides to accelerate the transfer of executive powers to the presidency. We expect Mr Erdogan to win the presidential election and to remain in office with enhanced powers for at least one more five-year term, if not two (the maximum allowed), up to 2029. His popularity is unrivalled, and the opposition is fragmented and lacks candidates capable of challenging him. In 2014 Mr Erdogan won the presidential election in the first round with just over 50% of the vote, well ahead of a joint candidate presented by the two main opposition parties, the Republican People's Party (CHP) and the Nationalist Action Party (MHP). The MHP's support in parliament for the AKP's presidential reform makes it unlikely that either of the two parties would consider fielding a joint candidate at the next election.
The clampdown on the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) since mid-2015, the MHP leadership's decision to back the presidential reform, and the hardline nationalist stance adopted by Mr Erdogan and the AKP could have a considerable effect on voting patterns at the next parliamentary election. Both the MHP and the HDP have been weakened since the 2015 elections and run the risk of falling below the high 10% national vote threshold for representation in parliament, which would help to boost the AKP's share of seats. Under the constitutional changes approved in the presidential reform referendum, there will be 600 seats in a much weakened parliament from the next election, up from 550 currently.
The next local elections are scheduled to take place by March 2019.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Since the failed coup Turkish foreign policy has been heavily conditioned by Mr Erdogan's domestic political goals, notably his push to establish a presidential system of government. This approach, combined with ongoing political upheaval in Europe and the US, has resulted in a marked deterioration in Turkey's inter-national relations with its traditional Western allies. Having deployed armed forces to back rebel groups in Syria to fight IS and prevent the expansion of territory held by US-backed PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurds, Turkey risks becoming embroiled in the conflict. Tensions and the risk of confrontation between Turkey and US-backed forces could escalate once IS is defeated.
Despite talk of agreeing a new roadmap to ease tensions and improve co-operation in the main areas of interest such as security, trade and investment, neither Turkey nor the EU is genuinely interested in Turkish membership of the bloc any more. However, neither has yet been willing to suspend negotiations unilaterally. If Turkey reintroduces the death penalty, as Mr Erdogan has suggested, the EU might not be able to avoid suspending the process. Our baseline forecast has been that the death penalty is unlikely to be reinstated, but this cannot be ruled out given the government's increasingly hardline nationalist stance. The suspension of accession negotiations would almost certainly prompt Tukey to end its collaboration with the EU to stem the movement of migrants and refugees into Europe. An agreement on a solution to end the de facto division of Cyprus between the Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north could help to improve Turkey's relations with the EU, but we believe that a settlement is unlikely during the forecast period (2017-21).
The administration of the US president, Donald Trump, is less concerned about Mr Erdogan's autocratic tendencies than its Democrat predecessor was, but is equally unresponsive to Turkey's domestic and regional security concerns. Vague US reassurances about support for Turkey's fight against terrorism avoided a full-blown crisis in May 2017, when, as expected, Mr Trump author-ised the supply of arms to the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) for the offensive against IS in its stronghold in Raqqa, Syria. As yet there has also been no response to Turkey's request for Mr Gulen to be extradited from the US to face trial in Turkey on charges of masterminding the failed coup.
Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved. Russia has lifted almost all sanctions, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly in relation to the conflict in Syria, where both are militarily involved but are pursuing contrasting goals. We expect relations to remain largely transactional, and the risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
Turkey's economy has shown considerable resilience during past bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing largely to the country's solid public finances and well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector. However, the recent stabilisation of the lira and a recovery in Turkish financial assets remain vulnerable to a return of global risk aversion, which could be triggered by tighter than currently expected US monetary policy in the coming months, although this is not our central forecast and we consider the probability of it happening to be low. Uncertainty about the direction of Turkey's economic policy also continues to cloud the country's medium-term economic outlook. The AKP government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges have blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. The current direction of policy appears to be towards a difficult balancing act between fiscal loosening and tight monetary policy while encouraging banks to lend to households and businesses.
We expect political instability and fluctuations in global liquidity to pose an ongoing risk to foreign capital inflows to Turkey, especially in the first half of the forecast period. These inflows are needed to meet the country's large external financing requirements, but tend to be short term and highly volatile. Faltering capital inflows put the lira under intense pressure in late 2016-early 2017, fuelling an acceleration in inflation that prompted the Central Bank of Turkey to start tightening monetary policy after a prolonged period of loosening. An abrupt tightening of policy could strangle Turkey's already fragile economic growth.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios-reflecting the impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past but also major upward revisions to Turkey's national accounts-give the AKP government some leeway to loosen fiscal policy to support the economy. Our baseline forecast remains that fiscal policy will be kept relatively tight, but that the central government deficit will widen, from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to an average of 2.1% of GDP per year in 2017-21. The government debt/GDP ratio is low, but it edged up slightly, to 29.4%, in 2016, from 29.1% in 2015. We expect a further moderate increase in 2017-19, before it declines to about 30% in 2021. However, the risk of a larger deterioration in the public finances cannot be ruled out. The government's decision to transfer Turkey's major state assets to a sovereign wealth fund set up in 2016 to help to finance major infrastructure projects could bring privatisation to a halt and increase political control over state companies, and the fund could become a vehicle for increased off-budget spending.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
In recent months political pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey to lower interest rates to revive economic activity has eased, but we expect that the central bank will have to keep monetary policy tight in the coming months in order to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent a further depreciation of the lira amid expectations of higher US interest rates. We expect the bank to use a mix of interest-rate rises, macroprudential measures and other policies. The central bank has raised most of its main policy rates since November 2016 and has increasingly provided funding to the banking sector at its previously little used "late liquidity window" overnight lending rate, which was gradually raised by a total of 250 basis points, to 12.25%, in late April. Since November 2016 the weighted average cost of the central bank's funds to the banking system has risen, from 7.8% to about 12% at end-May 2017.
The central bank is seeking to normalise gradually its monetary policy frame-work to establish a single policy interest rate, the one-week repurchase lending rate, which would help to improve transparency regarding monetary policy decisions. However, it is unlikely that the corridor will be eliminated until inflation is more firmly on a downward path towards its medium-term target of 5% and domestic political uncertainty eases. From 2017 the bank will hold only eight regular Monetary Policy Committee meetings annually rather than 12.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Domestic political instability, perceived security risks from terrorist attacks in 2015-16 and uncertainty about the global economic outlook will have negative but diminishing effects on the economy in the short and medium term. We expect real GDP growth to pick up only modestly, from 3% in 2016 to 3.2% per year in 2017-18. In 2019-21 we expect real GDP growth to average 3.8% per year, assuming that domestic conditions stabilise.
We expect real private consumption growth to accelerate from 2.3% in 2016 to an annual average of 2.4% in 2017-18 and 3% in 2019-21. A moderate improve-ment in confidence, recent stabilisation of the lira, government pressure on banks to ease lending conditions for households, and government incentives for the purchase of certain household durable goods should support growth in the short term. However, the risk over the medium term is that further domestic political uncertainty and tighter global liquidity will negatively affect capital inflows, hampering bank lending.
After expanding by 7.7% in 2016 we expect government spending to increase by nearly 8% per year on average in 2017-19 as the government seeks to revive the economy and boost support ahead of the 2019 elections. From 2020 we expect growth to be more moderate but still solid.
The deterioration in the business environment since the attempted coup will continue to dampen fixed investment growth in 2017-18, as weakened business sentiment and a more cautious approach by foreign investors will offset government plans to invest heavily in infrastructure projects. In 2019-21 we forecast an acceleration to average annual growth of 4.9%, assuming a less volatile domestic and global environment.
We expect the lifting of Russian sanctions on Turkey since mid-2016, the positive impact of a weaker lira on export competitiveness and stronger growth in the main export markets, especially in Europe, to drive a return to growth of exports of goods and services in 2017-21. However, we expect the perception of security risks to persist for some time, which will continue to deter visitors to Turkey and weigh on the tourist sector. Our expectation is also that a sharp slowdown in the Chinese economy in 2018 and a cyclical downturn in the US in 2019 will dampen external demand growth in those years.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
Consumer price inflation has remained stubbornly high-well above the official 5% medium-term target-as a weaker lira has, for the most part, offset the disinflationary effects of plunging global oil prices since mid-2014. We expect further currency weakness and a moderate recovery in oil and other commodity prices from 2017 to keep consumer price inflation well above the official target during the first half of the forecast period. Assuming that the central bank keeps monetary policy tight and does not loosen it too soon, we see inflation gradually easing, achieving the 5% target by end-2021.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
The Turkish lira has been highly volatile, plunging in value against all major currencies in late 2016-early 2017 and then recovering partially in recent months. Amid further bouts of volatility we expect the lira to depreciate against the US dollar to an annual average of TL3.63:US$1 in 2017-a fall of about 17%. In 2018-21 we forecast that the exchange rate will remain broadly stable in real terms, depreciating in nominal terms to an average of TL3.88:US$1 in 2021. The lira will also depreciate sharply against the euro in 2017-21. There are substantial risks to our exchange-rate forecast, arising from uncertainty about the outlook for global financial flows, and the impact on investor confidence of domestic political instability and geopolitical turmoil in the region surrounding Turkey.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
GDP revisions, moderate domestic demand growth, sharply lower global oil prices and a weaker lira have helped to reduce Turkey's current-account deficit in recent years. However, we expect it to widen moderately and remain sufficiently large-at a forecast average of 4.2% of GDP per year in 2017-21-to make it difficult for Turkey to meet its external financing needs if global liquidity is constrained and investor confidence deteriorates. Although a weaker lira and the lifting of Russian sanctions will boost Turkey's main export sectors, we expect this to be largely offset by the higher cost of imported energy and inputs for manufactured import-intensive exports. In addition, the tourism sector is likely to take several years to recover to 2015 pre-crisis levels, before the resurgence of terrorist attacks and the imposition of Russian sanctions.

Full text:   Argentina--highlights: Political outlook
The president, Mauricio Macri, will persist with economic rebalancing measures to return the economy to sustainable growth. The adjustment process involves some politically unpopular austerity measures that will sustain the risk of social unrest and strikes by powerful unions in the short term. On top of this, Mr Macri is in a minority position in both houses of Congress. To Mr Macri's benefit, however, a moderate faction of the dominant Peronist faction has proved co-operative in Congress to date, and strong presidential powers provide Mr Macri with some room for manoeuvre. On this basis, and based on an assumption of economic recovery, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects governability to remain relatively good. Nonetheless, given his party's minority position in Congress, and the priority that will be given to urgent macroeconomic reforms, progress in the pursuit of reforms that would successfully address long-standing institutional weaknesses and structural constraints to growth is expected to be limited.

Population growth has slowed in recent decades and is expected to remain below the Latin American average, although it will be outpaced by growth in the labour force in the outlook period. An ageing population will place a heavy demand on healthcare services, which have deteriorated in recent years. The effects of this decline will be lasting, but relatively high skills levels mean that the stock of human capital will, nonetheless, remain a source of compara-tive advantage, although improvements in some other Latin American countries will narrow the gap between Argentina and much of the rest of the region.

Argentina's position in our business environment ranking improves substantially between the historical and forecast periods. The weak historical ranking reflects the legacy of expansionary and distortionary macroeconomic policies, and a deterioration in the legal and regulatory framework. The Macri administration will continue to iron out distortions, which although contributing to still-high inflation in the short term, will improve the business environment. However, depending on the extent of public opposition, there is a risk that the government may be forced to backpedal, implying that implementation would be less successful than we currently assume.

The economy is emerging slowly from recession, amid deep macro-economic adjustments and continuing efforts to address the problem of legal and regulatory uncertainty. That said, we still expect the economy to pick up over the forecast period. There are downside risks to our GDP forecasts, as attempts by the government to reduce economic distortions and engineer a relatively smooth adjustment to a lower-inflation environment could prove extremely challenging, keeping both consumption and investment subdued for longer than we expect. There is also some upside risk, however, as investment could take off beyond expectations from 2017 once the gains from macro-economic adjustment materialise and assuming that efforts to restore confidence in the rule of law make progress. But even in this scenario, in the absence of deeper structural reform than we currently envisage, the potential growth rate will remain closer to 3% than to 4%.

Argentina's wealth of natural resources, a large domestic market with high per-head incomes relative to much of the rest of the region, and proximity and preferential access to the large Brazilian market represent attractive long-term opportunities for foreign investors (assuming that the Brazilian economy recovers gradually). However, economic adjustments to rein in inflation will deter investment in the very short term, at least as businesses wait on the sidelines while Mr Macri pushes through all the necessary politically and socially difficult adjustments.

We forecast that average annual GDP will grow by 2.8% in 2017-50, with the growth rate peaking at 3.1% in 2021-30 before slowing to 2.5% by 2041-50. Our forecasts assume that the contribution of capital to growth will be firm initially, before tapering off somewhat over the latter part of the outlook period. We also assume that as growth in the working-age population slows, the increase in the availability of labour will slow; as a result of this, growth will become more dependent on productivity gains.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates. b Actual.
Background: Economic liberalisation in the 1990s drove firm growth, but an inflexible exchange-rate mechanism and fail-ure to deepen structural reform left the economy vulnerable to shocks, contributing to the collapse in 2001 of Fernando de la Rúa's centre-left government. An interim government took power until Néstor Kirchner of the Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party) began a term in 2003. He presided over an economic rebound, which enabled his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, to win the presidency in 2007 and secure re-election in 2011. Economic policy mismanage-ment drove a change of government in 2015, with a centre-right candidate, Mauricio Macri, taking office in December 2015.
Political structure: Democracy was restored to Argentina in 1983 after 50 years of instability and military regimes. A strong presidential system is in theory checked by a bicameral Congress, comprising a 257-member Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and a 72-member Senate (the upper house); in practice, however, the presidency dominates. The presidential term is four years. There are 23 provinces and the Buenos Aires federal district, each with its own government.
Policy issues: Pro-cyclical expansionary policies contributed to GDP growth of an annual average 6.6% in 2005-11. But expansionary policy also produced significant imbalances in the economy in the form of double-digit inflation, real peso appreciation and a deterioration of the balance of payments. Amid currency pressures, the Fernández government resorted to foreign-exchange, import and capital controls, as well as ad hoc interventionism, to the detriment of the business environment. These policies did not reduce devaluation speculation, and left the economy extremely vulnerable to currency crisis. Macroeconomic adjustments to reduce economic distortions and set the economy on a more solid long-term footing are taking place under Mr Macri; these include peso devaluation, and fiscal and monetary tightening. Microeconomic reforms to boost domestic supply are also getting under way.
Taxation: The value-added tax (VAT) rate is 21%, although VAT on some goods and services is charged at a lower rate of 10.5%, and some services are taxed at a higher rate of 27%. Corporate income tax is levied at 35%, and personal income tax at progressive rates between 9% and 35%. There is a 0.6% tax on financial transactions (deposits and withdrawals). Taxes on exports were reintroduced in 2002, and have since been expanded to account for around 20% of total revenue.
Foreign trade: The current account shifted from surplus to deficit in 2010. Despite comprehensive controls, there was a current-account deficit of 2.7% of GDP in 2015.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
Present government: The president, Mauricio Macri, took office on December 10th 2015 for a four-year term ending in December 2019. Mr Macri was elected on the ticket of the Cambiemos electoral alliance. This alliance includes Mr Macri's own party, the centre-right Propuesta Repúblicana (Pro), along with the centrist Unión Cívica Radical and the smaller left-wing Coalición Cívica. Mr Macri's party is in a minority in the Senate (the upper house of Congress), where the opposition Frente para la Victoria (FV, a faction of the Peronist party) holds a majority. In the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house), the FV has the largest number of seats of any single party but does not have a simple majority.

Political outlook: Political stability
The political scene is becoming more complicated as voter fatigue with austerity measures increases and patience with adjustment measures wears thin. An increase in obstructionism on the part of public-sector unions in recent weeks is unsurprising amid annual wage-bargaining negotiations that are taking place in the run-up to mid-term legislative elections in October. More of a concern for the president, Mauricio Macri of the centre-right Propuesta Republicana (Pro), is the continued perception among voters that adjustment is not bringing about obvious rapid improvements in the economy. Various economic indicators suggest that the economy is indeed emerging from recession, but consumers are not yet feeling the benefit in terms of higher real wages or increased employment.
The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect Mr Macri to change course and abandon the adjustment process that he has pursued since taking office for a four-year term in late 2015. This process has involved devaluation, fiscal and monetary tightening, and sharp tariff adjustments. In this environment, voter weariness with austerity, combined with the approach of mid-term legislative elections on October 22nd, will in the short term complicate relations with Congress, where the president lacks a majority. The ruling Cambiemos alliance, which includes the Pro and the centre-left Unión Cívica Radical, has to negotiate support for its legislative agenda in both houses of Congress on an ad hoc basis with the various factions of the large Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party). So far this support has mainly been forthcoming, not least because the largest opposition force, the leftist-populist faction of the Peronist party, known as the Frente para la Victoria, has been weakened by a series of damaging corruption scandals.
We expect obstructionism to increase amid election-related politicking surrounding a mid-term election in October 2017, and as a presidential election in October 2019 approaches. But mutual interest will ensure some continuing co-operation between Cambiemos and moderate Peronists. On top of this, a strong executive branch (the president has substantial powers to rule by decree) should provide Mr Macri with room for manoeuvre, even assuming that Congress becomes less co-operative. The president will also retain influence with powerful provincial governors, who largely control the agenda of the Senate (the upper house) but who are in turn deeply reliant on central government transfers, some of which are discretionary. As a result, we expect some continued progress on the govern-ment agenda.
However, we assume that, with electoral considerations coming into play, there will be limited progress on legislation that would successfully address long-standing institutional weaknesses and structural constraints to growth. Compre-hensive efforts to strengthen bureaucracy, reduce corruption or enhance the effectiveness and independence of the judiciary will be slow. We do not expect meaningful advances on a structural reform agenda.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
A concentration of power in the executive helps to speed progress with the government agenda, but results in a lack of transparency in decision-making. The trend towards a concentration of power in the executive has occurred ever since the 2001-02 economic crisis, at which point extraordinary powers were given to the president to expedite policymaking. More than a decade on, these extraordinary powers have become entrenched; Mr Macri has for example periodically used decree powers to push through policy measures or political appointments, particularly when Congress is in recess. Although Mr Macri may be more likely to pursue them than his predecessor, reforms that would successfully address long-standing institutional weaknesses and strengthen the bureaucracy will prove politically difficult. The permanent state bureaucracy is made up mainly of low-paid clerical jobs. The professionals responsible for designing and implementing policy are appointed on short-term contracts, which are renewed with each change of government (or even minister).
Reforms to improve the legal system are required
Reforms are required to improve the legal system, which has for decades been plagued by corruption and inefficiency. Under the presidency of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-15), the courts resisted pressure to side with the government; the Supreme Court ultimately declared that a legal reform threatening judicial independence was unconstitutional, ensuring that the law (which had been passed by a razor-thin margin in Congress) did not come into effect. The presence of a non-Peronist executive provides some opportunity for a new judicial reform proposal that addresses the problems of corruption and inefficiency in the judiciary (there has been a historic tendency for executive-branch overreach among Peronists). Significantly, upon taking office Mr Macri quickly filled two vacant seats on the Supreme Court with candidates viewed as highly qualified and unbiased. However, we are not optimistic about significant reform measures being taken in the short term, given Mr Macri's minority position in Congress. Without a strengthening of the legal system, it will be difficult to address the problem of corruption in government. A number of investigations into members of the Fernández government are under way, but voters have complained of a lack of convictions.
Political outlook: Election watch
Mid-term elections are set for October 22nd. Open, nationwide primary elections will be held on August 13th, but, in practice, Argentina's political parties continue to choose their candidates via internal selection processes, and the primaries will therefore serve as a sort of dress rehearsal for the main event. With the primaries now less than three months away, campaigning is beginning to dominate the political scene. We expect the Peronists to remain the largest political force in Congress after the mid-terms, given their dominance of provincial politics and strong grassroots presence. The ruling Pro and its partners in the Cambiemos coalition are currently in a minority position in both houses of Congress, and we do not expect this to change in the mid-terms. For Cambiemos, a more important marker is whether it gains or loses seats, and how it performs on the Buenos Aires congressional list (voters select party lists; this gauges both how popular the political parties are and how popular the leading candidates on each list are). A good performance in Buenos Aires by the Pro, although mainly symbolic and not enough to provide a majority in Congress, would send a signal of the government's popularity. This is important because the dominant Peronist party would be much less likely to support the legislative agenda of an unpopular government.
The next presidential election is due in October 2019. Based on our assumption of moderate GDP growth and a return to single-digit inflation by then, we currently expect Mr Macri to win a second four-year term. There are substantial risks to this forecast, given the challenging external environment and the government's minority position in Congress. Reflecting the difficulties faced by minority governments in Argentina, no non-Peronist government has ever won a second consecutive term since the end of the military dictatorship in the 1980s. In this context, the emergence of a strong challenger from the moderate wing of the Peronist party is a substantial possibility and the election will be closely fought.
Political outlook: Key players to watch
Mauricio Macri
Mr Macri is one of the very few non-Peronist politicians to translate popularity at the local level into a presidential victory. Previously the popular right-wing mayor of the capital, Buenos Aires, a centre of opposition to the then-president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-15), Mr Macri was able to secure an electoral alliance with the centrist Unión Cívica Radical that gave him the nationwide political structure that he needed for a successful presidential campaign. Mr Macri's biggest political challenge to date has been in seeking consensus for difficult economic adjustments. So far, he has been successful; although his opinion poll ratings have slipped, they remain relatively high (above 50%). His negotiating skills (and those of key cabinet members) have been put to the test and have also proved successful so far, with major reforms including legislative approval for a deal with holdout creditors approved early on in his term.
Marcos Peña
Mr Peña, a close ally of the president, was appointed cabinet chief after serving in the same post in the Buenos Aires city government under Mr Macri. Mr Peña was elected to the Buenos Aires city government when he was just 26 years old, and was, with Mr Macri, one of the founders of the centre-right Propuesta Repúblicana (Pro) party. He plays a key role in the Macri administration as chief negotiator, both in Congress and in cabinet, and is at the centre of the most important government decisions.
Nicolás Dujovne
The finance minister, Mr Dujovne succeeded Arturo Prat-Gay in a cabinet reshuffle at the end of 2016, apparently in response to internal dispute between Mr Prat-Gay and the president of the Banco Central de la República Argentina (the central bank), Federico Sturzenegger, over the direction of fiscal and monetary policy. Mr Dujovne is a fiscal hawk and has emphasised transparency in fiscal reporting, introducing quarterly as well as three-year fiscal targets. In the coming year he hopes to enact fiscal responsibility legislation with the provinces. He has also mooted a broad payroll tax reform, but this is unlikely to be contemplated until after mid-term elections in October 2017, and is likely to face difficult passage through Congress, although it could be pushed through in a watered-down form, assuming that the ruling coalition fares moderately well in the mid-term elections.
Cristina Fernández de Kirchner
Although she holds no public post, the former president has been a thorn in Mr Macri's side and a fierce critic of economic adjustment measures under the new government. However, her influence appears to be waning as her political movement (the Frente para la Victoria, a left-wing faction of the Partido Justicialista-the Peronist Party) struggles with allegations of corruption during her presidency. Before corruption allegations against members of her government surfaced, Ms Fernández was thought likely to run for Congress in 2017, in an effort to position herself for another run at the presidency in 2019. However, the public mood seems to be shifting away from Ms Fernández, leading to a battle for control of the Peronist party among more moderate factions of the party.
Juan Manuel Urtubey
Mr Urtubey, the governor of Salta province, has been outspoken in recent years against Ms Fernández, and could prove a unifying figure for key Peronist politicians, including a number of governors who did not identify with Ms Fernández's lunge to the left of recent years and who represent more traditional Peronist views, closer to its trade-unionist roots. Mr Urtubey will face stiff competition for the leadership from other Peronist figures who are thought to also harbour presidential ambitions, such as José Manuel de la Sota, the governor of Córdoba
Political outlook: International relations
Efforts by the Macri administration to repair relations with trade and investment partners have achieved rapid results, and we expect relations with key trade partners in the region and elsewhere to remain strong, with the possible exception of the US. Like most other governments in Latin America, the Macri administration was wrong-footed by the victory of Donald Trump in the US presidential election in November 2016. After cultivating strong ties with the previous US administration led by Barack Obama (2009-17), Mr Macri is likely to abandon recent efforts to secure preferential trade ties with the US with a view to an eventual free-trade agreement. The Argentinian government will remain keen to seek trade deals under the auspices of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay; Venezuela was suspended from the group in 2016). The problem for Argentina and its Mercosur partners is that, just as the grouping has started to reverse its own protectionist tendencies, free trade has shifted off the political agenda not only in the US but also in Europe. Mr Macri recently visited Spain in an effort to drum up support for a deal, and negotiations are continuing. Our forecasts do not currently assume a successful conclusion of free-trade talks with the EU, but the workings of intra-Mercosur trade are likely to improve in the forecast period. Efforts at joining the Pacific Alliance, a regional trading bloc that includes Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico, may also make progress, although this is not currently reflected in our five-year economic forecasts.

Population growth will remain slow
Population growth has slowed in recent decades and is expected to remain below the Latin American average. Owing to a relatively low birth rate, the percentage of the population aged 14 or under is low by Latin American standards, and is falling. A declining gross birth rate and longer life expectancy also account for the high and rising share of the population aged 65 years and over, although, at just over 11% this is still below that of OECD countries, where shares above 15% are the norm. Even so, the ageing population places increasing demand on Argentina's healthcare services, which have deteriorated significantly in recent years.
The forecast rise in the economically active portion of the population is chiefly the result of an expected increase in the female participation rate. The latter has increased gradually to 48.5% in 2016, up from 40% in 1990. This is still below a total labour force participation rate of over 60% (and below the OECD average female participation rate of 51%) and can be expected to rise towards 50% in the forecast period. Although the gross birth rate is forecast to fall over the next decade, the gross mortality rate is expected to stay broadly constant as the ageing of the population offsets improvements in healthcare conditions. Argentina has in the past been the recipient of much inward migration (an estimated 85% of the population is of European descent) and has established quite a flexible approach to immigration. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects policy in this area to remain relatively flexible in the forecast period, enabling economic sectors such as agriculture and construction to continue to benefit from immigrant labour. Our positive medium-term economic forecasts for Argentina suggest that inward migration could pick up in the forecast period, following a period of substantial outward migration in recent decades. Partly owing to strong ties to Europe, 600,000 Argentinians are estimated to live abroad. Around one-third of these emigrated in the years immediately follow-ing the 2001-02 economic crisis. These newer emigrants are mainly middle-class young people who have moved to Spain, Italy and the US, many of whom benefit from dual Italian or Spanish citizenship.
An urban population with marked regional disparities
The population is highly urbanised. More than 90% of the country's population is concentrated in urban centres-one of the highest ratios in the world. The Buenos Aires metropolitan area contains almost one-third of the national population; when the hinterland of Buenos Aires (the pampas) is included, the proportion rises to two-thirds. Overall, population density is low, at 13 inhabitants per sq km (around one-third of the Latin American average), although this aggregate figure masks wide regional disparities: in the capital there are 13,679 inhabitants per sq km, whereas in the southern provinces of Santa Cruz and Chubut, population density is just 0.8 and 1.8 inhabitants per sq km respectively. Most measures of social and economic development show marked disparities between rural and urban areas, with per-head incomes and healthcare and education indicators much better in the Buenos Aires area than elsewhere.
Argentina's lead in regional healthcare and education standards will erode
Although Argentina's healthcare indicators still compare favourably with those of most of its neighbours, social conditions worsened markedly during the 1998-2002 recession, and in many areas problems have persisted despite firm growth for most of the following decade, suggesting that expenditure has become inefficient. The healthcare and education systems are in urgent need of reform. Even so, a high level of educational attainment by regional standards mean that the stock of human capital will remain a source of comparative strength, although improvements in some other Latin American countries will close the gap within the region.

Improvement of investment environment under new government
The Economist Intelligence Unit's global business rankings measure the quality and attractiveness of the investment environment in 82 of the world's largest economies, including 12 in Latin America. Argentina's 20-place jump in the overall rankings is the most significant improvement globally, by some distance. Partly, Argentina's improvement reflects a particularly poor 2012-16, charac-terised by the then-government's expansionary and distortionary macro-economic policies, a weak legal and regulatory framework as a result of ad hoc government interventionism, and policies that deterred trade and investment. Although the more market-friendly government of Mauricio Macri took office at the end of 2015, the average score for the 2012-16 historical period remains weak. Mr Macri's administration has made significant strides in rolling back the distortions that characterised the previous administration's tenure, resulting in a noticeable improvement in the investment climate and prompting an improvement in the component scores across virtually every area of the business environment.
Our forecasts currently assume that there will continue to be relatively rapid, large improvements in a number of key areas of the business environment, including the macroeconomic environment, policy towards private enterprise and competition, foreign trade and exchange controls, and financing. To Argentina's benefit, it already scores highly in a number of categories in which improvements are generally difficult and take longer to bear fruit, such as infrastructure, market opportunities and the labour market. Argentina's worst-scoring category will remain tax, as making improvements to the burdensome, unwieldy tax system will prove extremely difficult politically.
Business environment outlook: Argentina's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: The administration of Mauricio Macri works to address key weaknesses, including weak competition policy, the heavy burden of red tape and restrictive price controls.
2019-21: Continued work to build confidence in legal and regulatory framework. State participation in key sectors continues.
Policy toward foreign investment
2017-18: Efforts to resolve any remaining disputes with international creditors and investors as the government seeks fresh sources of US dollar inflows. Government makes concessions to oil investors in attempt to bolster foreign investment.
2019-21: Foreign direct investment is welcome. Improvement made in investment dispute settlement and availability of investment-protection schemes.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Remaining foreign-exchange controls likely to be removed. Continued efforts to improve the workings of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union) and develop closer relations with the Pacific Alliance.
2019-21: Possibility that FTA talks make better progress, but EU-Mercosur talks are unlikely to have reached completion.
Taxes
2017-18: Further gradual reductions of export taxes to encourage domestic supply. Tax system remains complex and burdensome.
2019-21: Comprehensive tax reform to improve federal-provincial revenue a possibility, but obstacles to reform persist.
Financing
2017-18: Banking penetration remains weak and long-term credit restricted, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, owing to weak long-term deposit base.
2019-21: Non-bank financing grows, but is constrained by a relatively small pool of institutional investors.
The labour market
2017-18: Tension with unions, owing to inflation. Political and bargaining power of the unions will remain strong.
2019-21: Progress on labour reform unlikely. Continued potential for conflicts with unions. Some skills shortages.
Infrastructure
2017-18: The Macri administration works to address weak contract rights and deficient regulatory regimes, which keep private investment below potential. Financing constraints hamper public investment in the short term.
2019-21: Some public and private investment set to improve energy supply and upgrade export infrastructure, but the risk of energy shortages will persist as demand grows.

Macroeconomic environment will improve sharply during the forecast period
Argentina's global and regional ranking for the macroeconomic environment improves substantially between the historical and forecast period. The weak score in 2012-16-one of the worst in our global model-reflected the highly distortionary policy environment under Mr Macri's predecessor, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-15). The institutional underpinnings of macroeconomic stability were poor, with a politicised central bank taking monetary policy decisions based on the government's fiscal demands and highly questionable official statistics, following a change of methodology and staffing at the the official statistics institute (Indec). The weak quality of policymaking also undermined the macroeconomic environment.
We expect significant improvements in all of these areas in 2017-21. Mr Macri's policy stance is much more investor-friendly, which has led to an improvement in the quality of policymaking and reasonable progress in addressing the distortions put in place by the previous administration, even though the consequences (most notably in high levels of inflation) will continue to hamper economic performance, at least in the short term. The government is also working to improve the quality of information and to restore operational independence to the Banco Central de la República Argentina (the central bank). Assuming that these efforts continue, Mr Macri should lay the found-ations for firmer medium-term economic performance.
The fact that Argentina's overall score and ranking in this area improves in 2017-21 is based on the assumption that the negative effects of the policy adjustment-which contributed to a recession in 2016-pass rapidly, with the economy returning to fairly solid rates of growth from 2017. Inflation will remain high but trend downwards, returning to single-digits from 2019. Fiscal consolidation efforts should reduce the deficit. Meanwhile, improved terms of trade are expected to reduce the current-account deficit.
There are downside risks attached to these projections. The assumption of a smooth transition out of recession and towards a (relatively) low-inflation environment with a more sustainable external position may be overly optimistic, given Argentina's track record (the country has a history of economic instability and disorderly swings from one economic model to another). Given the scale of distortions that Mr Macri inherited, as well as constraints to the achievement of a low-inflation environment such as wage indexation and growing public frustration with the short-term knock-on effects of policy tightening, it will take time to engender confidence in the central bank's capacity to contain inflation.

The economy will benefit from the return to a market-friendly policy stance
Argentina's score and ranking for private enterprise and competition improves substantially for the 2017-21 forecast period under our assumption that the Macri government continues to introduce measures that actively encourage private investment and promote competition. The Fernández government had a track record of arbitrary decision-making that was often detrimental to the private sector and eroded confidence in the legal framework. It also persistently focused its efforts on managing the economy at the company level (rather than adopting sounder fiscal or monetary policies), hampering the freedom of businesses to compete and giving rise to allegations of crony capitalism. Under Mr Macri, we expect a revamped competition commission to focus on amendments to anti-trust legislation. Across the public sector, a reduction in red tape is likely; legislation reducing red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) was approved earlier this year. The government will also remain committed to scaling back price controls and subsidies, although an official acknowledgement that measures are needed to cushion the impact on consumers of what are significant adjustments indicates that the process will be subject to delay. Although these efforts will be hampered by lobbying by special interest groups in the context of Argentina's long tradition of political clientelism, we expect significant improvements in all of these areas. Meanwhile, state participation in key sectors, including energy, utilities and banking, is expected to continue.
Under Ms Fernández, the Comisión Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia (CNDC, the competition authority) was a weak and ineffective body, doing little to prevent monopolistic practices or protect consumer rights. This is changing under Mr Macri. He appointed a new head of the CNDC in February 2016, Esteban Greco, who immediately performed an internal audit and made significant staff changes. He focused immediately on crafting a reform to the current anti-trust law, which was submitted to the legislature in late 2016. The reform would make the CNDC an independent body, tighten penalties for companies found guilty of competition-related offences and create an undersecretariat responsible for investigation, training and education. Closer co-operation with US competition authorities to train staff on mergers and acquisitions will also raise standards in this area. The reform legislation is still awaiting final approval, but we expect it to be passed in the coming months.
Agricultural export taxes and quotas are continuing to be scaled back, but the process will be subject to delays. Immediately upon taking office, Mr Macri eliminated export taxes on wheat, beef and corn. He also reduced the tax on soybeans-the most important export crop-from 35% to 30% in early 2016 and had indicated that the tax would continue to be cut by 5 percentage points each year. However, fiscal difficulties have prompted the government to delay the process. In October 2016 Mr Macri announced that the soybean export tax would be kept on hold until the beginning of 2018, when the rate will be progressively reduced by half a percentage point each month until the end of 2019 (implying an end-2019 level of 18%). We currently expect the scaling back to continue from 2018, but there could be renewed delays if economic performance is weaker than we are forecasting.
The process of scaling back price controls on consumer goods will progress very slowly in the short term. Upon taking office, the government kept a price control programme, Precios Cuidados, in place, as it sought to curb the pass-through effect on inflation of currency devaluation, but it reduced the number of basic consumer items covered from 500 to 317. But since then a number of new products has been added to the list, with over 450 products now covered, in response to stubbornly-high inflation. Renewed efforts to reduce price controls on consumer goods are unlikely until inflation begins to subside.
There has been more progress on efforts to raise electricity and natural gas tariffs. Following a removal of subsidies and an increase in wholesale prices in early 2016, in June the government introduced hefty price increases for end-users, with gas bills quadrupling for most consumers and electricity bills rising by around six-fold, in spite of considerable domestic opposition. In early 2017 the government announced new increases to utility rates in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area of 60-148%. Even with the increases, the government will still be shouldering a fiscal burden of around 1.5% of GDP in terms of gas and utility subsidies. The authorities will continue to scale back subsidies in 2018-19, entailing further raises in utility rates, with the aim of aligning domestic rates with market rates by the end of 2019. However, this timetable may slip if inflation fails to fall as expected.

Foreign investment to pick up
Argentina's score and ranking for policy towards foreign investment improves significantly between the historical and forecast period. This reflects Mr Macri's much more welcoming stance towards foreign capital and his efforts to make government policy towards foreign investment more transparent, clear and predictable. Progress on lifting energy tariffs will make foreign participation more attractive, while the sovereign's exit from default in April lifts a major constraint on foreign investment by reopening access to investment protection schemes (a key factor driving the increase in Argentina's score in this category for 2017-21). The government's more market-friendly approach means that the risk of expropriations is much lower, while government favouritism of domestic firms will be less marked. Despite the new government's more welcoming stance to foreign investment, we expect outright privatisation to remain off the agenda. The public still places much of the blame for the 2001-02 crisis on the privatisation process of the 1990s, in which foreign firms featured heavily.
Argentina's exit from default has facilitated access to capital markets, but the government's ambitious plans for infrastructure and housing development will still necessitate foreign participation in the context of fiscal expenditure constraints. With this in mind, a bill establishing a public-private partnership (PPP) framework for investment was signed into law in December 2016. Official estimates that it could raise potential capital inflows by US$90bn are likely to prove extremely optimistic, but the legislation will boost foreign participation in the country's infrastructure drive.
Energy policy reforms to liberalise tariffs and promote investment are likely to boost multinational interest in deals to commercialise Argentina's vast shale oil and gas reserves (the world's second-largest). Even though the government is likely to continue to align energy prices with market levels, the process is expected to be gradual, and recent pledges to foreign energy companies to offer labour flexibility and price subsidies in exchange for firmer commitments to move pilot projects (of which there are currently 18) into the development stage (in which there are only two projects) will lift inward investment.

An easing of controls is well under way
Mr Macri's rapid moves to dismantle currency controls upon taking office are the main factor driving the improvement in Argentina's score and ranking in this area. Rather than a steady and gradual process, the government opted for an immediate lifting of controls and simultaneous devaluation of the peso, on the basis that this would provide clarity, transparency and a strong signal of the government's commitment to change. Most export duties were removed and the requirement for official authorisation from the tax bureau for all US dollar purchases and profit remittances was lifted. The move has essentially eliminated the black-market exchange rate, and fears of an uncontrolled unravelling of the peso have been unfounded (although the peso has weakened moderately).
Mr Macri's close relations with the Brazilian president, Michel Temer, are facilitating trade liberalisation efforts by Mercosur, the Southern Cone customs union. There has been recent progress on a long-mooted free-trade agreement (FTA) between Mercosur and the EU, with a week of negotiations in late April in Buenos Aires between both sides. However, significant obstacles remain-particularly over the treatment of agricultural products, with several EU countries (including France) concerned about exposing their own agricultural sectors to greater external competition-and we do not expect both sides to sign a final FTA within the forecast period. But an increase in intra-regional trade is possible, particularly if efforts to join the Pacific Alliance, an integration project that includes Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico, and on which Argentina has observer status, are successful.

Despite improvements, the tax system will remain complex
Although we expect some improvements in 2017-21, Argentina's tax system will remain the weakest area of the business environment. Tax policy is becoming more predictable under the Macri government, but it will take time to address the system's complexity (over 35 different types of tax are collected), high costs and inefficiency. According to the World Bank's 2017 Doing Business report, in Argentina a medium-sized company takes 359 hours per year to prepare, file and pay its taxes, compared with an OECD average of 163 hours, and pays a total tax rate (including labour contributions) of 106% of profits (the OECD average is 41%). At 35%, the corporate tax rate is one of the highest in the region. Under Mr Macri, a reduction and eventual elimination of the most distortionary taxes, such as agricultural export taxes, will be likely. But a broad-and politically difficult-reform to increase the consistency and equity of the system has long been put off and remains extremely unlikely to be addressed in the forecast period. Although we expect both tax evasion and labour informality to moderate somewhat, significant improvements in these areas are unlikely.
Reforms to the system of revenue-sharing with the provinces are badly needed to secure the stability of the tax system. Although there have been some efforts to reduce discretionary transfers to provinces, continued delays on a comprehensive reform can be expected, given Mr Macri's focus on boosting macroeconomic performance. In the absence of a reform package, the executive will continue to roll over provincial debt, as it has done several times since 2010. Until the problems in the system of revenue-sharing with the provinces are addressed, weaknesses in the provincial finances will sustain the need for further central government bailouts and therefore raise the risk of periodic ad hoc measures at the national level to increase tax revenue.
The Macri government has passed several tax measures to improve conditions for SMEs that have been particularly badly hit by deteriorating economic conditions. From the start of 2017, SMEs have been exempt from the minimum notional income tax levied on companies' assets. This tax accounts for a very small share of total tax revenue (0.2% in 2015), but is burdensome for SMEs (particularly for manufacturing companies who generally have more assets in the form of equipment than service providers), as it must be paid even in the event of losses. In addition, SMEs are now able to offset bank debit and credit tax against income tax. SMEs are also able to pay value-added tax (VAT) on sales every three months rather than monthly, which will assist with cashflow. Finally, to encourage investment, the law offsets up to 10% of new investments in capital goods and infrastructure against income tax.

Yet although we envisage an improvement in conditions for foreign companies operating in Argentina, long-term credit lines will still be restricted-particularly for SMEs-by structural constraints, including the banking sector's weak deposit base (a legacy of the 2001-02 crisis). Medium- and long-term credit for domestic business is therefore likely to remain scarce until late in the forecast period. Large foreign companies will continue to meet most of their financing needs through external sources. Banking sector regulation and supervision are expected to be reasonable, while financial soundness and profitability indicators will remain solid. However, some weaknesses in the system persist, including shallow financial markets and low levels of banking penetration.
Domestic capital markets will remain underdeveloped by regional and particularly global comparison. The nationalisation of private pension funds in 2008 was a serious blow to their growth and has had a lasting impact. Argentina's private pension-fund administrators were the country's most important institutional investors and were a growing source of finance in the local capital markets. Under current regulations, the Administración Nacional de Seguridad Social (Anses, the social security agency, which took over the nationalised pension fund assets) is able to allocate up to 50% of assets in local private companies' shares and up to 10% of assets in foreign government securities. Although reforms are likely and the Macri government is unlikely to use the Anses funds to finance government investment, the changes will take time to bear fruit, and growth with be from a very low base: stockmarket capitalisation stood at less than 15% of GDP in March 2017. The stockmarket is currently shallow and undiversified, with ten companies accounting for around 95% of total market capitalisation.

Labour market reforms are unlikely
Although we do not expect a sharp improvement in the labour market in 2017-21, the relatively well-educated, productive and flexible labour force has long been an asset to the country's business environment (and made the labour market one of Argentina's highest-ranking categories in the historical period). That we do not expect significant improvements (indeed, Argentina's global ranking is expected to fall in 2017-21) reflects the political difficulty of securing support for reforms to simplify labour regulations and addressing the highly unionised labour market that produces a high incidence of strikes. In the short term, difficult economic adjustments that are contributing to a decline in real wages and a cut in purchasing power will translate into a high level of strikes, particularly as the government continues to rein in wage increases against the backdrop of high levels of inflation. Mr Macri faces a tough task in tackling union power, and we expect little progress on reducing the extent of wage and other labour-market regulation.
Although we expect labour reform to be slow and piecemeal, it should gradually help to boost business sentiment. A first step approved in Congress in early 2017 was a reform of the Labour Insurance Law. The law allows workers who have suffered accidents or work-related illnesses to seek compensation in the courts. Because so many do so (claims are reported to have multiplied by a factor of 40 since 2003), insurance premiums paid by employers against such claims are very high. The reform seeks to reduce premiums by establishing new medical commissions that will weed out unreasonable or bogus compensation claims before they reach the industrial tribunal stage. Changes are also being proposed to make it easier for employers to "formalise" informal workers, bringing them in to the tax and benefits system, and to centralise training schemes to be run by a single national agency. For political reasons, further reforms are likely to be pursued in a piecemeal fashion and may be put on the backburner at sensitive times during wage negotiations. In the meantime, sector-by-sector negotiations could continue. An outline deal with unions and employers in the oil industry reached in January 2017 cuts overtime and allows multitasking for workers in the Vaca Muerta shale oil and gas field in Patagonia.
Skills shortages and mismatches have become more of a problem for business in the past decade, compounded by a lack of effective training pro-grammes in both the public and private sectors. Secondary and tertiary enrollment are very high by regional standards, but educational outcomes are not as strong as would be expected given these rates, and vary widely by province. At the same time, access to job training tends to be unequal and informal.

More private investment will help to upgrade infrastructure
Infrastructure remains Argentina's highest-scoring area of the business environment, although its global ranking slips as other similarly-scoring countries make more progress. The country boasts a well-developed telecoms network, as well as relatively low property rental costs. However, physical infrastructure has suffered over the past decade from a lack of investment. We currently assume that Argentina's exit from default, the passage of PPP legislation and improvements in contract rights will help to boost investment both in transport infrastructure and energy. However, such projects will take time to come on stream, explaining Argentina's unchanged score in 2017-21, raising the risk that infrastructure bottlenecks will continue to hamper growth in the meantime.
The risk of energy shortages will persist in the short term at least, given long project completion times. Demand for electricity and gas has soared in the past decade, but as tariffs for residential and business consumers are lifted, demand growth is expected to slow. Argentina is expected to sign a final agreement with China in the coming weeks to construct a fourth and fifth nuclear reactor in Argentina, with construction expected to begin in 2018. Aside from this, prospects are less certain. Despite Argentina's vast hydroelectric potential, no further large projects are under way. The government is preparing several auctions in both the conventional and renewable sector over the course of 2017, but successful bids are unlikely to translate into new capacity until late in the forecast period (or even after). In the short term at least, the lack of new energy capacity coming on stream will maintain dependence on imports, and increase exposure to weather-related problems at existing hydropower facilities.
Economic forecast: Policy trends

The Macri administration has made good initial progress on a programme of adjustment intended to put the economy on a sounder footing, having devalued the peso, reduced agricultural export duties and energy subsidies, and secured a deal with holdout creditors (allowing Argentina to exit default). However, macroeconomic adjustment remains incomplete, and policy efforts to reduce inflation will continue, in the form of tight fiscal and monetary policy and restraint in nominal wage growth. The latter in particular is proving a difficult political challenge, and has encountered stiff union resistance. The government is extremely unlikely to meet its goal of limiting nominal wage growth to 20% this year, but we do continue to expect nominal wages to trend downwards steadily from levels of above 30% in recent years. All of these measures should gradually engender price stability and ultimately boost investor confidence, although we do not expect inflation to fall to single-digit levels until 2019.
With macroeconomic adjustment measures proceeding apace, the government is gradually turning its attention to the structural reform agenda and to reforms to improve the business environment, and we expect a growing policy emphasis on these areas. The government has already passed new public-private partnership framework legislation that should facilitate an increase in infrastructure investment, along with reforms to reduce red-tape financing for small and medium-sized enterprises. The development of longer-term finance and the deepening of Argentina's currently shallow capital markets will be a priority. However, other aspects of the policymaking environ-ment will remain suboptimal, with progress on labour-market reform (to improve flexibility) or comprehensive fiscal and tax reform (to reduce costs and complexity) unlikely in the medium term amid political obstruction.

The government has changed the methodology of its fiscal reporting, and because it now presents profits from the Banco Central de la Repùblica (BCRA, the central bank) below the line as financing rather than above the line as revenue, the outturn on the non-financial public-sector deficit is substantially higher than previously reported, at 5.9% of GDP in 2016 (versus 4.5% of GDP previously). Our forecasts have been revised upwards as a result, although the trend remains the same. In the short term, higher than expected revenue from a tax amnesty on undeclared foreign assets will bolster the fiscal accounts and allow the government to meet its target of narrowing the fiscal deficit to 4.2% of GDP in 2017, slightly below the 4.5% of GDP registered in 2016. We expect the government's gradualist approach to fiscal tightening to continue in subsequent years, bringing the fiscal deficit down to a more manageable level of about 3% of GDP by the end of the forecast period, and bringing the primary deficit down to about 1% of GDP by 2021. To date, the govern-ment has taken some important steps to try to narrow the deficit, particularly by reducing costly subsidies and the public-sector payroll. Even so, in the light of recently announced income-tax breaks and increased transfers (to expand the social safety net), deficit reduction will be slow.
In the aftermath of the holdout deal, and assuming that there is progress on deficit reduction, the government's ability to finance moderate deficits without resorting to inflationary money printing will be much improved. A moderate public debt/GDP ratio (and low levels of external indebtedness), combined with the attractiveness of Argentina's still-high yields, should facilitate international bond issuance in 2017-21, following Argentina's exit from default earlier this year. In January the sovereign issued US$7bn in five- and ten-year global bonds. As a percentage of GDP, the public debt will stabilise at slightly under 50% in 2017-21.

Notwithstanding a recent policy reversal, which saw the BCRA lift the policy rate from 24.75% to 26.25% in April, we continue to expect fairly substantial rate cuts in the second half of 2017 and beyond. The policy rate is below the year-earlier peak of 38%, but inflation has been slow to come down amid a series of tariff increases, and inflation expectations have been rising as a result, to slightly over 21% at end-2017, well above the central bank's 12-17% target range for this year. The BCRA has responded with what we expect to be a one-off rate rise to make its commitment to the newly implemented inflation-targeting framework clear. Assuming that monthly inflation starts to fall towards 1% on a consistent basis, we expect ample scope for renewed monetary easing from later this year.
The central bank has made it clear that it will prioritise monetary policy that is conducive to a reduction of inflation, and our forecasts assume moderately positive real interest rates in the medium term, consistent with a deepening of credit and the development of long-term lending. This forecast is supported by the shift to an inflation-targeting regime (with the target due to be lowered to 8-12% in 2018 and 5% in 2019), and assumes reduced political interference after a period of politicisation under the previous administration.

After a contraction in real GDP of 2.3% in 2016, we expect a return to positive territory in 2017. But with Brazil likely to post barely positive growth in 2017, manufacturing activity in Argentina will recover only moderately, limiting GDP growth to 2.6%. We currently expect the recovery to peak in 2018, with growth of 3.6%. However, the annual growth rate for that year masks an expected sequential deceleration in the second half of 2018, resulting from a projected weakening of Chinese import demand. By 2019, when we project a cyclical downturn in the US economy, real GDP growth in Argentina will slide back below 3%, before a modest recovery takes hold again in 2020-21.
Our forecast for a relatively robust recovery in the medium term is based on the assumption that a combination of macroeconomic adjustment and improvements to the business environment will eventually have some beneficial impact on both export activity and domestic demand. An easing of inflation, combined with efforts by the Macri government to address the problem of legal and regulatory uncertainty and reduce red tape, should set the stage for renewed strong growth in fixed investment and private consumption, supporting an acceleration of GDP growth.
There are downside risks to our GDP forecasts, as attempts by the government to reduce economic distortions and engineer a smooth adjustment to a lower-inflation environment could prove extremely challenging, keeping both con-sump-tion and investment subdued for longer than we expect. However, there is also some upside risk, as investment could overtake expectations from 2017 once the gains from macro-economic adjustment materialise and depending on the success of efforts to improve the framework for doing business. However, even in this scenario, in the absence of deeper structural reform efforts than we currently envisage, the potential growth rate will remain closer to 3% than 4%.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Agriculture will continue to be a key contributor to the Argentinian economy. Although it has accounted for around 10% of GDP over the past decade, and for around 20% of private employment, these figures underestimate its contribution, as they do not include agro-industry. Weak soft commodity prices relative to the boom years of the commodities supercycle will have some dampening impact on agriculture. However, we believe that a more important factor in the sector's growth prospects will be the easing of export taxes and quotas by the Macri administration. This follows a period of ever-tightening controls implemented by the administration of the former president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-15), to keep domestic prices low, which ultimately restricted profitability and hence output. A more stable, clear and attractive environment for agriculture producers will boost output. It will also support agro-industry (including the processing of Argentina's key crop, soybean) and bolster a manufacturing sector that is currently struggling amid still-weak demand both at home and in Brazil. We expect a mild economic recovery in Brazil in 2017-21, which will also help to produce a moderate pick-up in Argentinian manufacturing in 2017-21.
Better incentives should boost key sectors
Mining and energy are two sectors with great potential. Argentina has vast shale and gas resources, but, to date, commercialising them has proven difficult, particularly in the wake of the nationalisation of the country's largest energy company, YPF, in 2012. The Macri administration has started to tackle some of the main problems constraining investment, which, apart from a lack of confidence in the rule of law, include price controls that keep gas prices well below the international market price. In early 2017 the government announced a series of measures to boost investment and domestic production, thereby reducing reliance on imports. The measures include the "flexibilisation" of labour conditions in Vaca Muerta, a 30,000-sq-km oil field located in southern Argentina that is the world's second-largest shale gas reservoir and fourth-largest shale oil reservoir. The government is also hoping gradually to eliminate price distortions, but will retain high gas prices as an incentive to investment in the medium term. In exchange, oil companies including YPF, Total (France), Pan American Energy (Argentina), Chevron (US), Shell (Netherlands) and Dow (US) have agreed to invest US$5bn in Vaca Muerta in 2017. These increases in investment should see exploration and production activity in the sector rise steadily this year and in the remainder of the forecast period.
The mining sector also has substantial potential. It shares the mineral-rich southern Andes mountains with Chile, long recognised as one of the world's mining powerhouses. However, a longstanding combination of national neglect and provincial restrictions has slowed the pace of development. The latest available data show that Argentinian mining accounts for around 0.3% of GDP, and it is estimated that only around 15% of Argentina's mineral deposits are currently being exploited. A succession of governments in 2002-15 were seen as hostile to foreign mining companies, while being supportive of restrictive local content rules and in dispute with foreign creditors. The Macri administration has shifted government policies in a much more sector-friendly direction, and several projects are being developed. With global metal prices continuing to recover moderately, solid mining growth is still viable. But much will depend on the details of provincial-level regulations. The constitution grants ownership of sub-soil minerals to the provinces, and local regulations vary.
In an effort to standardise the regulatory environment for mining, a preliminary national mining accord was signed among the provinces in February. This agreement seeks, among other things, to augment public- and private-sector oversight of environmental matters; regulate public mining ventures along the same lines as private-sector operations; create a lithium board (with a view to formulating a comprehensive development plan for this rapidly developing subsector); and standardise the mining tax and royalty regime. The next step will be approval from the president to send the accord to the national legislature and to the provincial legislatures for their approval. The plan therefore has some way to go before it takes effect.

Consumer price inflation will decline steadily but gradually in the forecast period, from a rate of 29.4% in April (according to the Buenos Aires city index). Although high, the April result does represent a steep fall from a peak of 44.4% in May 2016, which resulted from currency and tariff adjust-ments by the new administration. Assuming tight monetary and fiscal policy (spending will remain negative in real terms until 2018), the inflationary spike will prove transitory, and we expect gradual disinflation in the medium term, provided that domestic demand remains subdued relative to the boom years of 2004-11 and domestic supply strengthens on the back of an improved regulatory environ-ment for agricultural producers. The main risks to this forecast stem from possible failure to tighten fiscal policy as projected, a weaker than expected peso and the difficult process of reining in nominal wage growth. However, if the government is able to tackle the high level of wage indexation, there is also the potential for inflation to slow more than we currently project.

The peso stood at Ps15.7:US$1 in late May, having strengthened modestly from Ps15.9:US$1 at end-2016 on the back of increased portfolio flows. We expect renewed modest weakening in 2017-21, particularly in the first half of the forecast period as domestic interest rates decline and the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) continues a monetary tightening cycle. However, the positive outlook for portfolio and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows will be supportive of the currency, which will dampen depreciation pressure and produce some periods of real currency appreciation (as has occurred in recent months). In nominal terms, we expect the peso to end 2017 at Ps17.78US$1 and 2021 at Ps23.61US$1.

As the terms of trade improve and a weaker peso gradually boosts goods and services exports, improvements in the trade and services accounts will cause the current-account deficit to narrow. From 2.6% of GDP in 2016, we expect the deficit to fall to an annual average of 1.2% of GDP in 2017-21. We also expect the country's ability to finance moderate current-account deficits to improve, assuming that portfolio and FDI inflows pick up as investor confidence grows. The result will be a rise in foreign reserves in nominal terms. Our forecasts currently assume FDI inflows averaging 2% of GDP in 2017-21, with foreign reserves equivalent to an annual average 8.1 months of import cover in the same period.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Argentina
Stocks and flows
The inward foreign direct investment (FDI) stock was US$92bn (15% of GDP) in 2015 and the outward stock of FDI was US$38bn (6% of GDP). Inflows of FDI to Argentina have been volatile in recent decades and have followed economic cycles of boom and bust. In the 1990s inflows to Argentina increased substantially, reaching 3.7% of GDP in the second half of the decade, reflecting a privatisation programme and acquisitions of domestic private firms. This was followed by a collapse in inward FDI to 1.4% of GDP in 2001-03, reflecting Argentina's default and subsequent deep recession. Devaluation stimulated a rapid recovery of inward FDI in subsequent years, with inflows averaging 3.7% of GDP in 2003-08. Since then, however, FDI inflows have weakened, from 3% of GDP in 2008 to an annual average 1.8% of GDP in 2009-15. Since Mauricio Macri took office in December 2015, the government has worked to address concerns about the strength and predictability of the legal and regulatory environment. For now, however, inward FDI remains subdued by weak economic activity and tight macroeconomic policy.
Origin and distribution
US firms account for one-quarter of the stock of FDI, followed by Spanish firms with 16%, and Dutch firms with 11%. Chilean, Brazilian and Uruguayan companies account for around 5% each. Spanish firms have invested in privatised utilities, banking and energy. European firms in the utilities and banking sectors were hit hard by the 2001-02 crisis. As many companies disinvested after the crisis, firms from Brazil, Mexico and Chile bought up cheap assets. In 2015 the largest foreign direct investor in Argentina, by some distance, was the US, followed by Spain. The potential for an influx of Chinese FDI, focused in particular in agri-business, is thought to be substantial. However, the latest local-source data on FDI inflows into Argentina by country show that, of US$13.3bn in total inflows in 2015, less than US$100m came from China.
Determinants
FDI into Argentina is quite broadly spread; oil accounts for 20% of the stock, followed by chemicals, the automotive sector, metal minerals, the financial sector and telecommunications, although in the past decade almost half of FDI inflows have gone into manufacturing. Historically, Argentina has attracted investors hoping to take advantage of a relatively affluent and protected domestic market. During the 1990s, and as a result of rapid trade liberalisation, domestic market-seeking investment focused on sectors that showed comparative (or even absolute) advantages or were naturally protected from foreign competition (non-tradeable services, such as utilities). Efficiency-seeking investments have been less common, and have been mainly limited to the automotive industry, where government incentives have been in place for over a decade. Recent FDI in services (including information technology-IT) has been attracted by Argentina's skilled workforce and relatively low wages.
Impact
The presence of foreign subsidiaries has brought positive spillovers (both within and across industries) in manufacturing, but only in sectors where domestic firms have proven sufficiently adaptable. In other cases, increased competition from foreign investors, or a preference on the part of the latter for foreign suppliers, has damaged local firms. Telecoms is one example of a sector where the quality of service and technology has been transformed by foreign investment. Foreign investors own most of the privatised utilities. After the 2001-02 maxi-devaluation, which in effect broke the terms of foreign inverstors' contracts (and after the government declined to renegotiate), investment declined. The contribution of foreign firms to local research and development activities has been limited, as technical progress has been mainly embodied by imported capital goods and turnkey plants. Foreign firms account for a large share of Argentina's exports.
Potential
The major attractions for FDI will be a growing and relatively high-income domestic market, strong natural-resource endowments and, to a lesser extent, Argentina's potential as a manufacturing base. A relatively large pool of skilled human capital and a large stock of natural resources constitute Argentina's long-term advantages. Argentina's exit from default in 2016 will also act as a spur to FDI inflows, by facilitating investor access to investment guarantees and trade finance, which has until recently been lacking.

Argentina's wealth of natural resources, large domestic market (with high per-head incomes relative to much of the rest of the region), and proximity and preferential access to the large Brazilian market represent attractive long-term opportunities for foreign investors. On top of this, The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecast of a shift to moderate GDP growth rates of an annual average 3.2% in 2017-21, and an improvement in the environment for business, suggests an increase in domestic market opportunities in the medium term.
Some improvement in purchasing power expected
Argentina is a middle-income country with one of the highest levels of GDP per head in the region-US$21,258 at purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates in 2016. Demographics are generally supportive of growth: the population is estimated at around 44m (the fourth-largest in Latin America), and is relatively young, albeit not as young as that of most other countries in the region. Moreover, urbanisation is high, at more than 90% of the population. However, as in much of the region, income inequality and poverty remain high. According to recently released data from INDEC, the national statistics institute, the poverty rate came in at 30.3% in the second half of 2016. The extreme poverty rate was 6.1%. Although this represents a gradual improvement on early 2016, the poverty rate is clearly still high, and the gap between the cost of the basic consumption basket (used to measure the poverty line) and the average income of poor households is considerable: the former came in at Ps13,945 (US$870), while the latter was only Ps8,789. However, there are significant geographical disparities, with poverty rates highest outside of the capital, Buenos Aires. By national comparison, the poverty rate was highest in Santiago del Estero, in the north-west, at 44%. In Greater Buenos Aires province, which encircles but does not include the capital city, the poverty rate was also high, at 34.6%, probably reflecting the impact of a steep decline in manufacturing in the province. By contrast, the poverty rate was just 9.5% in the capital itself.
A full analysis of the poverty data over time is complicated by a lack of historical data. A deterioration of statistical quality during the previous administration led to unreliable poverty statistics; in the latter years of the previous administration, INDEC stopped publishing poverty statistics altogether. Under new leadership, INDEC began publishing poverty data in mid-2016, using new methodology that is not comparable with the discredited historical data. However, the latest INDEC data are similar to figures published by the Centro de Estudios Distributivos Laborales y Sociales (Cedlas), a social policy research institute at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata. According to Cedlas, the poverty rate is roughly similar to data from the first half of 2011, implying that there has been no progress on poverty reduction since then. In the medium term, lower inflation rates and steady economic growth should help to reduce poverty through spillover effects. In the meantime, however, poor social conditions will drive insecurity and social unrest.

A long-term shift in consumer attitudes was brought about by the economic crisis of 2001-02, which changed patterns of goods consumption markedly. A shift towards cheaper brands and lower-cost, high-volume outlets was not reversed even during the boom years of 2004-07. However, we expect the proportion of income spent on food, beverages and tobacco to fall gradually in the forecast period, and for the proportion of consumer spending on hotels and restaurants, healthcare, leisure and education to grow. This assumes growth in purchasing power as real disposable incomes rise over the course of the forecast period, driven by growth in employment, income redistribution via Argentina's relatively new conditional cash transfer schemes, and greater efforts at financial inclusion, which suggest a steady increase in access to bank credit during the forecast period. One difference between Argentina and the rest of the region will be the age of the population. Argentina's population will remain markedly older; just over 11% were aged 65 years and over in 2015. This will affect consumption patterns, notably pushing up overall expenditure on healthcare.

Abundant natural resources and a skilled labour force underpin potential
Argentina has historically been susceptible to cycles of boom and bust, reflecting both a vulnerability to external conditions and domestic policy challenges. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecast rests on the assumption that Argentina will adopt a more sustainable economic model that reduces fiscal and external imbalances, allowing the economy to grow by an average of 2.8% in 2017-50.
Initial conditions: Argentina's GDP per head of US$12,445 in 2016 (US$21,258 at purchasing power parity) is one of the highest in the region. However, as it is still only one-third of the US figure, there is clearly potential for Argentina to catch up to developed-country levels. The internal market is relatively large and, although the territory is extensive, there are few internal geographical obstacles, although Argentina is distant from developed-country markets and high transport costs will place an extra burden on exporters. For a decade after the 2001 maxi-devaluation, labour was cheaper than during the 1990s, but the gains from devaluation had been eliminated by 2012 amid high inflation and sustained real wage growth. Despite two decades of gradual de-industrial-isation, Argentina retains a solid skilled labour base and some capacity to carry out high-level research and development. It will attract manufacturing invest-ment, but its competitiveness as a global manufacturing centre will lag behind Asian rivals. Argentina has strong comparative advantages in agriculture, although, as a commodity producer, it will face more volatile terms of trade than Asian competitors. This means that growth is likely to be uneven.
Demographic trends: Argentina shares demographic as well as cultural features with Europe. The average age of the population is higher than in most of the rest of the region and population growth both in percentage and absolute terms is expected to be slightly lower. We expect population growth of 0.7% per year in 2017-50, less than half the average recorded in 1980-2000. At present, the working-age population is still growing faster than the overall population, but we expect this trend to change from around 2030. Although labour force participation rates will continue to rise gradually towards OECD levels, from an estimated 64% in 2020, growth in the labour force will slow as a result. Particularly towards the end of the long-term forecast period, the contribution of labour to GDP will therefore be weaker.
The population is more urbanised and better provided with healthcare than in other Latin American countries, leading to a life expectancy of around 76 years, similar to that of many developed countries. Given the existence of the welfare state and the severe weakening of the finances of the state and private pensions systems in the past two decades, the growing elderly population will increasingly generate strains on the public finances.
External conditions: Growth-determining factors exogenous to Argentina will include the level of developed-country interest rates (in the past this has been strongly correlated with the volume of capital flows into Latin America and has had a major impact on growth) and commodity prices. Argentina will remain highly dependent on income from exports of agricultural commodities to provide an investible surplus for deployment elsewhere in the economy. Restricted access to finance since the 2001 default has raised the cost of capital in the past decade by forcing reliance on financing from the shallow, more expensive domestic market. However, Argentina's exit from default in April 2016 implies improved access to international capital markets to facilitate stronger growth in investment, particularly in agriculture, energy and infrastructure.
Institutional weaknesses will constrain growth
Institutions and policy trends: Disappointing economic outcomes have been the indirect result of shortcomings in policymaking and institutions. Argentina scores moderately to poorly on measures of corruption, security and the rule of law. Our analysis suggests that an improvement in the overall institutional climate would have a significant impact on long-term growth, but institutional reforms will take a long time to bear fruit. The quality of policymaking is likely to improve more rapidly. The government of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-15) clashed with foreign investors over the terms of contracts, and oversaw a phase of ad hoc intervention in the economy. A more market-friendly administration led by Mauricio Macri is seeking to address these problems, and we assume that the government will succeed early on in the long-term forecast period in establishing a new framework for foreign investors in sectors such as utilities.
GDP will grow by an annual average of 2.8% in 2017-50
Long-term performance: We forecast that average annual GDP will grow by 2.8% in 2017-50, with the growth rate peaking at 3.1% in 2021-30, before slowing to 3% in 2031-40 and 2.5% by 2041-50. Our forecasts assume that the contribution of capital to growth will be firm in the first part of the forecast period, before tapering off somewhat over the latter part of the period. We also assume that as growth in the working-age population slows, the increase in the availability of labour will slow, meaning that growth will become more dependent on productivity gains. To the extent that they are achieved, these gains are likely to be made via technology transfer and higher foreign invest-ment. Firms will increasingly look beyond national borders in order to achieve economies of scale, and this will stimulate efficiency gains. Having said this, and although Argentina's abundant natural resources and relatively strong skills base represent solid economic potential, the country will struggle to achieve the productivity gains needed to converge with developed-market income levels. This is particularly the case in the light of low levels of domestic investment in research and development, and we expect limited progress in catching up with developed country incomes even in the long-term forecast period.

Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines ten separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, and infrastructure. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 16 (infrastructure), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2012-16) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2017-21). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2012-16. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2017-21 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
The main sources used in the business rankings model include CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce; Freedom House, Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties; Heritage Foundation, Index of Economic Freedom; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; UN, Human Development Report; US Social Security Administration, Social Security Programs Throughout the World; World Bank, World Development Report; World Development Indicators; Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Report.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2012-16 ranges are then used to derive 2017-21 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2017-21, not to the likely situation in 2021 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2014 or 2019). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text:   Venezuela--highlights: Political outlook
Politics will be dominated by a volatile power struggle between the unpopular Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) government and the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD). Risks are growing that the PSUV will seek to cling to power beyond the next elections (scheduled for December 2018) by non-democratic means, with support of the military. Given the scale of opposition to the government, and limited means of addressing opposition concerns via institutional channels, there is also a high risk of a chaotic, violent transition, particularly in a context of a crippling economic crisis that the government has shown little willingness or capacity to address. Even under our current, benign assumption (which is subject to unusually high levels of uncertainty) of a transition to a MUD-led government in 2019, Venezuela will remain plagued by weak institutions, endemic corruption and poor security conditions, but we expect the MUD to undo many of the macroeconomic distortions imposed by successive PSUV governments since 1999.

Venezuela will enjoy a structural demographic bonus in 2017-21, as it will experience a more rapid increase in its working-age population than in its overall population. But amid deep recession, the country will struggle to deal with new entrants to the labour market, and the already-large informal economy will expand. The old-age dependency ratio will remain low by developed-country standards, but population ageing will place growing pressure on the heavily indebted social security system in a context of volatile public finances.

Venezuela's position in our business environment ranking falls in 2017-21 to 79th place globally, making it one of the least attractive locations of the 82 countries covered in our rankings. This reflects unpredictable state inter-ventionism, highly heterodox macroeconomic policies, a lack of legal security and difficulties in accessing foreign exchange. Weak and politicised institutions, an unpredictable tax regime, a rigid labour market, and deteriorating infrastructure will also impair the business outlook. Assuming a political transition later in the forecast period, improvements will emerge. But these will take time, given the damage done by heterodox policymaking. There will also be only modest advances in addressing the country's structural constraints, and curbing corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency.

A combination of highly distortionary economic policies and still-low global oil prices will prolong Venezuela's recession in 2017-19. Inflation will remain in triple-digits until 2020 and the currency will remain highly overvalued. As a result, the black market for foreign exchange will remain rampant. A weak revenue base and falling oil output will sustain an extremely wide fiscal deficit in the first half of the forecast period, and the government will remain at a high risk of failing to meet its external obligations. Overall, the risk of economic collapse is high, with hyperinflation likely to be triggered in the event of debt default. Our forecasts for 2020-21 are more positive, based on the benign assumption that substantial international financial assistance will help an MUD-led administration stabilise the economy.

US-dollar measurements of Venezuela's market size provide an overly positive picture of the economy, given the marked overvaluation of the fixed exchange rate. In reality, the recession and extremely high inflation (driven by a scarcity of key consumer goods) will continue to restrict purchasing power. Although Venezuela is generously endowed with natural resources (it has the largest oil reserves in the world, estimated at 300bn barrels), extremely challeng-ing conditions will keep private-sector investment well below potential.

Assuming a political transition in 2019 that will lift economic distortions and improve the business environment, we expect that Venezuela's economy will begin to recover. But the damage inflicted to the economy in recent years (with a 30% decline in real GDP in 2013-19) will prove difficult to reverse. As such, recovery will be gradual, with GDP growth averaging 1.8% annually in 2017-30. In 2031-50 we forecast that Venezuela's real GDP growth will pick up to 2.4% as rising investment in human capital boosts labour productivity growth, helping to offset deteriorating demographics. Persistent oil dependency will be difficult to undo, and a weak productive base will limit overall economic output.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed 1992 coup. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez was diagnosed with cancer in 2011 but, after declaring in July 2012 that he had fully recovered, won a fourth presidential term in October 2012. However, his health quickly deteriorated and he died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has since plummeted.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is a federal republic, successive administrations have proven reluctant to devolve political authority, with the transfer of financial resources from federal to local level highly dependent on the central government. The legislature is unicameral, and elections for the National Assembly take place every five years. In December 2015 the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the legislature, but its powers have been usurped by other branches of government dominated by the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV). In May Mr Maduro announced that he wanted to rewrite the 1999 Constitution-apparently a ploy to entrench the PSUV in power.
Policy issues: Political radicalisation has been reflected in increasingly heterodox economic policymaking, with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus, and the nationalisation of industries deemed strategically important. Distortions created by this approach have become evident, with inflation rising sharply in spite of price controls, and with capital controls spawning a rampant black market for foreign exchange. Failure to invest part of the oil windfall has led to a startling decline in physical infrastructure. Non-oil production has in effect ground to a halt, leaving the economy entirely dependent on the energy sector. With large oil shipments going to China to repay loans, and (on subsidised terms) to regional neighbours via the PetroCaribe oil-financing scheme, the country is running very short of US dollars, forcing cuts in import spending.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 60% for oil firms. Since 2011 a maximum royalty of 95% has applied to oil extraction. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Official data are unavailable, but The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$5.9bn in 2016 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages. The current-account deficit is estimated to have fallen from 4.3% of GDP to 2.1% of GDP.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
Venezuela is a multiparty democracy. However, the independence of its institutions has deteriorated sharply in the past decade, as has its system of checks and balances. Power is concentrated in the executive, currently headed by the president, Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), who took office in April 2013 after a snap election. This followed the death from cancer of his predecessor, the highly charismatic Hugo Chávez (1999-2013), who built a cult of personality around himself and ushered in a brand of nationalistic populism known as chavismo. In the September 2010 legislative election, the PSUV and its allies lost their two-thirds majority in the National Assembly. Five years later, in legislative elections in December 2015, the PSUV lost its simple majority altogether, gaining just 55 seats, against 112 claimed by the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD), a broad coalition of parties from across the political spectrum that was formed in 2008 to present a united front against the PSUV government. The main parties comprising the MUD are Primero Justicia, Acción Democrática, Un Nuevo Tiempo, and Voluntad Popular, which together hold 109 seats.
Despite its technical majority, the MUD has not been able to do anything to alter government policy, as sustained efforts by the government (as well as the government-controlled Supreme Court) have eroded the power of the legislature and restricted the rights of the opposition. This culminated in a Supreme Court ruling in late 2016 (citing alleged irregularities in the 2015 election) that all legislation passed by the National Assembly would be null and void, which has essentially neutralised the legislature as a political actor. Decision-making is therefore concentrated entirely in the hands of the executive and judicial branches. Mr Maduro has given policymaking powers to the PSUV's allies in the military as he seeks to cement their support for his regime.

Political outlook: Political stability
Amid the most severe economic crisis in its history, Venezuela's political scene will remain dominated by a volatile power struggle between the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) government, led by the president, Nicolás Maduro, and the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD), which won a majority in the National Assembly in late 2015. Political tension has escalated recently amid growing signs that the government is seeking to cling to power through non-democratic means. Mr Maduro announced at the start of May that he would seek to convene a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution promulgated by his predecessor, Hugo Chávez (1999-2013). Constitutional reform proposals seem designed both to reduce the role of the elected National Assembly and to postpone, perhaps indefinitely, national elections due to be held in December 2018. The govern-ment used its control of key state institutions to scupper opposition efforts to hold a recall referendum (allowed under the constitution) to remove Mr Maduro. The government also effectively eliminated the National Assembly's legislative powers. Violent public protests have ensued in response; these show little sign of letting up, but also show little sign of weakening the Maduro government's hold on power.
This grip on power is largely based on the continuing support of the military, which will play a decisive role in future political developments. The govern-ment has to date secured military both by eliminating dissent in its upper echelons and by including the military in a system of patronage that has given it significant policymaking powers. It is not certain, however, to what extent the military would be willing to support the government if it were to attempt to hold onto power by non-democratic means, for instance by declaring an economic emergency as a justification for calling off the presidential election.
There have been instances in the recent past in which the military and other political actors have been seen to intervene to force the government to respect democratic norms. After the legislative election in 2015, the defence minister, Vladimir Padrino López, affirmed publicly that the army would uphold the constitution. Earlier this year, the attorney-general, Luisa Ortega, publicly criticised a Supreme Court attempt to take over the National Assembly's powers, which was subsequently abandoned. All of this suggests that there are limits to support for the beleaguered Maduro administration from its allies in the military and elsewhere. On this basis, The Economist Intelligence Unit still expects the December 2018 election to take place, and for the MUD (which would be the clear favourite) to win, taking power in 2019. But there is a high risk that the PSUV, with the backing of the armed forces, will attempt to cling to power beyond this date. Given the scale of opposition to the government, and the increasingly limited means of addressing opposition concerns via institutional channels, there is also a strong risk of some sort of chaotic, violent political transition, particularly in the context of a crippling economic crisis that the government has shown little willingness or capacity to address.
Assuming that an MUD-led government does take power, it would implement economic adjustments to reduce the role of the state in the economy, and unravel the many macroeconomic and monetary distortions that the PSUV has implemented since it came to power in 1999. It will also begin the difficult task of reforming deeply politicised institutions. Given the scale of the economic distortion and institutional destruction that has taken place in Venezuela, as well as the heterogeneous nature of the MUD-which is aligned mainly in its desire to remove the current government from office-the process will not be a smooth one. Weak institutional capacity and high political tension will persist throughout the 2017-21 forecast period.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
In 2017-21 Venezuela will continue to suffer from one of the weakest political and institutional frameworks in the region. Under Mr Chávez, the decision-making process was characterised by arbitrary decisions, often subject to reversals, and the Maduro government has proved little different in this respect. There is little discussion of policy proposals among the wider public, and the technical quality of the laws passed is extremely patchy. Institutional effectiveness will remain very poor, undermined by a politicised judiciary and high levels of corruption. Moreover, the credibility of the country's institutions will continue to decline, with particular concerns about an increasing lack of accountability and transparency, including in the use of public finances and the management of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company. The government's aggressive stance towards some foreign multinationals (while granting more favourable treatment to other companies from countries with politically sympathetic governments) is expected to continue.
Facing mounting opposition protests and growing unpopularity, Mr Maduro announced in May 2017 that he intends to re-write the Constitution. Details of the process are scarce, but the PSUV will seek to entrench its power and, quite possibly, delay calling the December 2018 elections. Our baseline forecast assumes that the elections will be held and that there will be a political transition in 2019 to the MUD. At the same, we recognise the risk of demonstrations turning more violent and eventually dislodging the Maduro government. Any post-transition period would be turbulent, as it would inevitably result in the dismantling of the PSUV's influence in key state institutions and its politics of patronage, which had, until recently, given it an overwhelming degree of support from certain segments of the population. Undoing nearly two decades of gradually tighter state control over the economy will not be easy, as the country will remain vulnerable to macroeconomic risks, either from domestic adjustment or external shocks. Although we believe that an opposition govern-ment will seek to rebuild the country's institutional capacity, this will take considerable time; in the meantime, violence and corruption will be endemic, especially while economic conditions remain weak.
One of the legacies of the Chávez era will be the persistence of special interest groups such as public-sector unions, regional party bosses and high-ranking members of the military, who are likely to continue to enjoy considerable power. The poor quality of bureaucracy will also constrain the effectiveness of policymaking. A new administration is likely to bring many of the social programmes introduced during the Chávez era back under the control of the relevant ministries rather than retaining them as off-budget misiones, social programmes that are funded by oil proceeds and prone to clientelism. Assistance from multilateral lenders will ease the transition.
Violent crime is expected to remain a major problem, fuelled by impunity, shortcomings in law enforcement and the growing problem of crossborder drug-trafficking. The homicide rate has risen sharply over the past 15 years. According to official figures, Venezuela recorded a homicide rate of 58 per 100,000 people in 2015, although private sources claim that the rate was much higher. Some sources also put the capital, Caracas, at the top of its list of most violent cities in the world, with a homicide rate of over 100 per 100,000 people. Aside from homicides, there have been numerous high-profile kidnappings for ransom in urban areas, a development that has increased concern over police corruption and mismanagement. Express kidnappings, in which people are held for a short period of time until they have withdrawn money from their bank accounts, are also rampant. This increase in criminality will not be halted unless measures are adopted to improve the competence and effectiveness of law enforcement agencies and the criminal justice system, reduce rates of impunity, and boost youth employment.
Political outlook: Election watch
With the next presidential election due in December 2018, the electoral authorities are placing a host of obstacles in the MUD coalition's path, forcing most parties to re-register and banning a leading opposition figure and presidential frontrunner, Henrique Capriles, from running for election for 15 years, citing "administrative irregularities" in his tenure as governor of Miranda state. Assuming that open elections are held, we expect the MUD to win by a large margin (as it did in legislative elections in 2015). The timing of the elections is increasingly uncertain. A contro-versial constitutional redrafting proposal put forward by Mr Maduro would entail a long rewriting process and would also, in theory, need to be put to a nationwide referendum, all of which would take time and could be used as a pretext for delaying elections. The position of the military towards any such efforts, and to the election process itself, will be decisive, and the risks to our forecasts are unusually high.
Political outlook: Key players to watch
Nicolás Maduro
A former union leader and co-founder of the party that brought Hugo Chávez to power in 1999-the Movimiento V República-Mr Maduro is a radical leftist. In 1999 he was elected to the assembly that rewrote the constitution. He was elected to the National Assembly in 2000 and was its president in 2005-06. He was minister of foreign affairs in 2006-12. After the 2012 presidential election, Mr Chávez appointed him vice-president and announced that Mr Maduro should succeed him. Following Mr Chávez´s death from cancer in March 2013, Mr Maduro took over the presidency, and then stood for the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) in the 2013 presidential election, winning by less than 1.5 percentage points against Henrique Capriles of the Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD). The sharp deterioration of the economy since then has weakened Mr Maduro's standing dramatically. In response, he has attempted to entrench his power via emergency decree powers. He has found it more difficult to engage with the masses with the ease that Mr Chávez did, hurting his popularity. With other senior PSUV politicians and military representatives being granted increasing powers, Mr Maduro is now somewhat of a figurehead, faced with the task of managing the competing factions within his party.
Tareck El Aissami
A minister under Mr Chávez in 2008-12, Mr El Aissami subsequently served as governor of the state of Aragua until his appointment as vice-president in January 2017. Since replacing Aristóbulo Istúriz, he has quickly accumulated far more sweeping powers than his predecessor. Three weeks after his appointment, Mr Maduro devolved important new powers to Mr El Aissami, including direct budgetary control over all ministries, hiring responsibilities for senior management at state-owned companies, the ability to make decisions over expropriation, responsibilities for allocating foreign exchange to different ministries and decision-making powers over tax rates (both sales and income taxes). Mr El Aissami now has control over areas that have always been the responsibility of the president, suggesting that he may be being lined up as the PSUV's preferred successor. His firm ties with the army substantiate this interpretation. He is a controversial figure internationally: the US placed sanctions against him in early 2017 on the grounds that he helped drug-trafficking to the US.
Diosdado Cabello
A former military officer and veteran of the 1992 coup movement led by Mr Chávez, Mr Cabello remains a highly influential member of the PSUV, although representing a different faction to Mr El Aissami. In the past, Mr Cabello has held the posts of minister of the interior and justice, vice-president (during an abortive 2002 coup) and minister of public works-the latter after he was defeated by Mr Capriles in his bid to win re-election as governor of Miranda state in November 2008. He is also vice-president of the PSUV. Mr Cabello is said to wield effective influence over large sectors of the economy, including both nationalised companies and private industries. His brother, José David Cabello, is minister of industry and head of Seniat, the tax and customs agency. A master of behind-the-scenes chavista factional politics, Mr Cabello is regarded as a right-winger by the left of the movement and is reportedly distrusted by Mr Maduro's allies. However, he has significant support among the upper ranks of the armed forces.
Henrique Capriles
The 44-year-old governor of Miranda state, which includes much of the Metropolitan District of Caracas, Mr Capriles has twice stood for president (in 2012 and 2013) as the candidate of the opposition MUD coalition. Representing the centrist Primero Justicia (PJ) party, Mr Capriles entered the political scene at the same time as Mr Chávez in 1998 and is untainted by association with the widely discredited pre-Chávez regime. Two energetic campaigns brought him close to winning the presidency and Mr Capriles is still perceived as the de facto leader of the opposition, particularly as another senior figure-Leopoldo López-remains in prison. However, hopes that he might contest a third presidential election in December 2018 have apparently been dashed by an April 2017 ruling that bans him from running for elected office for 15 years. This was the result of a decision by the comptroller general (who is responsible for overseeing fiscal revenue and expenditure) that Mr Capriles was guilty of "administrative irregularities" in 2011-13. Fears that the government is seeking to disqualify anyone with a reasonable chance of winning the 2018 election have fuelled anti-government demonstrations in the capital, Caracas. The government is unlikely to reverse this ruling, so it is unlikely that Mr Capriles will be permitted to stand.
Leopoldo López
Leader of the more radical wing of the MUD, Mr López was jailed in February 2014 and has remained imprisoned since then, for his alleged involvement in violence that followed an opposition march. A founder member of PJ and later a member of Un Nuevo Tiempo, he founded his own party, Voluntad Popular in 2009. The previous year he had been banned from holding elected office for six years, a move that frustrated his bid to become mayor of metropolitan Caracas. He pulled out of the primaries to select the MUD's 2012 presidential candidate and became Mr Capriles's campaign manager. In early 2014 he was one of the main proponents of the "la salida" movement that promoted street demonstrations as a way of forcing political change. His decision to turn himself in to the authorities helped to boost his popularity, making him the clearest rival to Mr Capriles as opposition leader, should he be released from prison. Mr López's wife, Lilian Tintori, continues to wage a highly publicised campaign calling for her husband's release and has met with many high-profile leaders (including the US president, Donald Trump) in support of these efforts.
Political outlook: International relations
Venezuela is becoming increasingly isolated amid growing regional and global censure of the Maduro regime, although this is doing little to weaken the government's grip on power. The government has announced its withdrawal from the Organisation of American States, which promotes regional co-operation and is a frequent election observer, pre-empting probable suspen-sion from the organisation. Venezuela had already been suspended from Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) in late 2016. Although relations with neighbouring countries such as Colombia are likely to deteriorate, the government appears concerned with retaining good relations with China (a key creditor), and with not provoking the US administration, presumably to avoid sanctions such as a cut in oil imports, which would hit Venezuela hard. However, US-Venezuela tension would escalate if the government were to attempt to cling to power by suspending the December 2018 elections. Reflecting its external financing diffi-culties, Venezuela will continue to scale back-and possibly end-oil shipments to beneficiaries of PetroCaribe, an agreement that provides cheap financing for oil exports to regional allies. Relations with Cuba, the closest such ally, will become more distant as Venezuela's ability to provide economic assistance is eroded.

A demographic bonus will be wasted as a result of economic woes
Although population growth will remain weak because of a falling birth rate, Venezuela will enjoy a demographic bonus in 2017-21, but this will be largely squandered as a result of the poor economic policies and a resulting deep recession that has left a greater proportion of the population outside the labour force. The annual population growth rate slowed from 2.8% in the 1980s to 2.3% in the 1990s and 1.8% in 2000-10, before decelerating steadily to 1.2% in 2016. We expect the annual rate of population growth to continue to slow, averaging 1.4% in 2017-21. Contributing to the slowdown is emigration by Venezuelans, which is anecdotally estimated at around 1.5m people since 2000, with the rate speeding up since 2014 as crisis in the country has deepened (there are no official data). Assuming a recovery later in the forecast period, this will lead to a rise in the participation rate and a faster growth rate in the labour force compared to that of the working age population. The total population is expected to reach 33m by 2021, with just under two-thirds between 15 and 65 years old. Population density is low, at 34.5 people/sq km, but rising. Distribution between urban and rural areas is highly uneven, with around 90% of the total population living in urban centres. Underdeveloped rural infrastructure, limited job opportunities in the countryside and fixed agricultural prices (in many cases, below the cost of production) will result in a continuing trend of urbanisation in 2017-21, creating problems in the main cities.
The labour participation rate declined in 2004-12 (owing to an increased uptake of education linked to the government's social programmes), but ticked up marginally in 2013 and 2014, before falling again in 2015 as economic conditions worsened. In the light of continued economic recession, we believe that the participation rate fell further in 2016. Although we are forecasting some improvement later in the forecast period, we expect the participation rate to remain below 70% throughout the forecast period. A very poor business environment, severe macroeconomic distortions and some of the highest labour costs in the region-exacerbated by the approval in 2012 of a labour reform that creates extra costs for employers-will continue to limit job creation, forcing more people to seek work in the informal sector, which is already estimated to account for around half of employment. According to the authorities, the official unemployment rate fell from 8.5% in 2010 to 6.8% in 2015. However, given that this coincided with a sharp deterioration in local economic conditions, it is likely that it reflects inflexible labour laws (which make it virtually impossible to lay off workers) rather than any significant job creation. It is also possible that the data are unreliable, as it is highly implausible that unemployment has remained low in the midst of a deep economic recession, with a growing number of companies folding.
Poverty indicators improved during the tenure of Hugo Chávez (1999-2013), but these data are no longer published by the authorities. Independent academic sources estimate that poverty rates are rising rapidly and that many people are forced to skip meals owing to chronic food shortages. A study by two public universities found that in 2016, 78% of Venezuelans lost weight because of food shortages, with the average per head weight loss coming in at around 9 kg. Shortages of medicines and surgical supplies are creating huge problems in the healthcare system, while insufficient vaccines are resulting in the re-emergence of diseases that had previously been practically eradicated.
Public services will remain under strain from a lack of resources
The old-age dependency ratio will remain low by developed-country standards but, in the context of volatile public finances, population ageing will place growing pressure on the heavily indebted social security system. The Instituto Venezolano de los Seguros Sociales (IVSS, the social security system) will remain under significant strain, with corruption exacerbating inefficiencies. IVSS hospitals will continue to suffer from crumbling infrastructure, and lack of supplies (including medicines) and equipment. The latter are mainly imported, or assembled from imported parts, and supplies have fallen victim to a lack of US dollars. Hospital building and rebuilding programmes have been a failure, owing to mismanagement of funds and shortages of building materials. Even a parallel welfare system, the Sistema Nacional de Misiones, is struggling to function as the government makes cuts and inflation erodes purchasing power. Overall, the provision and quality of public healthcare and education services is therefore expected to deteriorate further. This will also reflect long-running problems including a pronounced deficit of technical and basic skills, and the continued emigration of professionals, particularly doctors and nurses.

The investment climate has deteriorated under Nicolás Maduro
The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings place Venezuela among the world's least attractive investment locations during the historical period (2012-16). However, the country slides further in the ranking for the current forecast period (2017-21), to 79th place (down from 78th) of the 82 countries covered in the business environment rankings model, above only three countries (Cuba, Angola and Libya). Venezuela's operating environment has long been a challenge for investors, owing to weak institutions and persistent cycles of boom and bust. Conditions deteriorated under the presidency of Hugo Chávez (1999-2013) as a result of political conflict, erosion of the legal framework for investors, and promotion of a state-led model that hampers private enterprise and competition. These conditions have worsened since Mr Chávez's successor, Nicolás Maduro, took office in 2013, and critical economic problems are paralysing the investment climate. Even though foreign investment is desperately needed to reverse a deep and protracted recession, there is little prospect of a shift in the government's policy stance as long as Mr Maduro remains in office.
Improvement later in the forecast period assumes a political transition
Despite the fact that Venezuela's overall ranking remains very poor, it does register a slight improvement in its overall score in the forecast period, reflecting expected improvements in several categories relating to government policy. This in turn reflects our assumption that a political transition to an opposition-led administration in 2019 will result in a change in official policy towards investors. This affects the "policy towards foreign investors" category most noticeably (where Venezuela's global ranking improves from 78th to 63rd), but it also prompts improvements in the political effectiveness and market opportunities categories.
The envisaged improvements in policy stance will take time to filter through to actual performance, as tackling the deep distortions that have built up over so many years will prove highly destabilising. The macroeconomic environment is therefore likely to deteriorate further, with Venezuela's ranking set to fall to the world's lowest in 2017-21. The ranking for foreign trade and exchange controls will also deteriorate, based on the assumption that capital and exchange controls will be eased only gradually. The huge gap between the current fixed exchange rate and the black-market rate underlines the difficulty in moving towards a floating exchange rate and we expect only gradual progress in this area by the end of the forecast period. The other main area in which we expect deterioration is political stability. Not only is the Maduro government's survival increasingly reliant on an erosion of democratic institutions and military support, but an opposition-led administration will also struggle to cement its position, as high public expectations for an immediate improvement in the economic situation will be difficult to meet. Divisions within the heterogeneous opposition coalition will also prove a barrier to long-term political stability.
Business environment outlook: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Government persists with bias against free markets and ad hoc recourse to heterodox measures. Nationalisation poses a diminished threat, given fiscal weaknesses. Property rights remain weak. Price fixing undermines profitability.
2019-21: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Access to project financing is difficult and uncertainty over contractual rights persists.
2019-21: Efforts to attract foreign investment gather pace under a new government, although actual investment flows remain fairly low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2017-18: Frequent ad hoc adjustments to the unorthodox exchange-rate policy framework add to uncertainty. The state continues to exercise tight control over access to official-rate US dollars. Private firms must use a much weaker rate.
2019-21: Efforts to remove trade and exchange controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly, after a political transition takes place.
Taxes
2017-18: Government's low approval ratings reduce the risk of tax increases, despite the huge fiscal deficit. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2019-21: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2017-18: Credit growth remains firm, but sectoral allocation is distorted by administrative interventions. Banks remain highly profitable, although unpredictable enforcement and a weak regulatory framework heighten instability.
2019-21: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2017-18: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. An ongoing freeze on redundancies, combined with a large informal sector and skill shortages, makes the labour market exceptionally rigid.
2019-21: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Access to water and electricity supplies remains precarious. Underinvestment in power transmission ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2019-21: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued electricity rationing.

The macroeconomic environment will weaken further
The macroeconomic environment is the weakest area of Venezuela's business environment. During the forecast period, Venezuela's macroeconomic environment will rank as the least attractive of the 82 countries covered in our index, with the underlying score deteriorating even further. This reflects several factors, including our forecast of an ongoing recession in 2017-19, after three years of steep contraction in 2014-16. A combination of price and exchange controls-and a persistently hefty fiscal deficit financed largely by money printing-has pushed up inflation and eroded real incomes, while fuelling shortages of basic goods and a rampant black market. In the context of triple-digit inflation and the concurrent risk of a bout of uncontrolled hyperinflation, the authorities have lost the ability to address massive overvaluation of the official exchange rate. Moreover, the huge premium at which foreign currency trades on the black market engenders widespread corruption among official bodies with access to fixed-rate US dollars.
Even though we expect the opposition to gain power later on in the forecast period, the process of dismantling currency and price controls and moving towards a more orthodox macroeconomic policy stance will be difficult, given the depth of economic distortions that have built up over a prolonged period. If mismanaged, the short-term impact of any adjustments could be very substantial, with inflation and interest rates likely to rise even more sharply than forecast. Even assuming external support from the IMF and the World Bank, the economic adjustment process is likely to be highly disruptive (although extremely beneficial in the long term).
Our baseline forecast is that the Maduro government will continue to service its external debt, even though reserves levels remain very low and there are very few sources of external finance willing to extend credit to such a high-risk sovereign. In the light of these factors, there are significant risks to our forecast that Venezuela will avoid default, particularly given a rising current-account deficit and capital flight. We assume that a new opposition-led administration will have to negotiate a significant restructuring of liabilities in order to ease pressure on the economy and create space for an adjustment of the policy stance.

The score for policy towards private enterprise and competition will improve from a low base in 2017-21, reflecting some gradual improvements towards the end of the forecast period under an opposition-led government, but Venezuela's ranking in this category will still be among the least business-friendly among the 82 countries. Operating conditions have long been challenging, but the current government will refuse to alter its stance-characterised by bias against free markets, weak, politicised and inefficient institutions, and widespread price-fixing-despite supply constraints amid a deepening economic crisis. Hopes that greater currency and debt pressures will force Mr Maduro to adopt a more pragmatic approach are likely to be dashed. Uncertainty over contract and property rights, distortionary price and exchange controls, and the cumbersome burden of government regulation will continue to restrict businesses' freedom to compete under Mr Maduro.
Competition policy will remain problematic under the current administration. Under Mr Chávez, contracts in energy and heavy industries were revised to give the government greater autonomy and a larger share of the tax take. The government resorted to outright nationalisation in some cases, affecting a number of sectors (communications, cement, steel production, food distribution, financial services and retail). Under Mr Maduro, there have been fewer takeovers of private companies. This reflects the fact that the authorities are already over-stretched and performance in nationalised firms has slipped since the government's intervention. However, the president will continue to blame the private sector for the country's weak economic conditions, and may use this as a pretext for further erosion of companies' freedom to operate.
The government is nominally seeking private investment in the oil sector, but foreign partners will be allowed to hold only minority stakes in joint projects with PDVSA, the state oil monopoly. Private-sector enterprises have scope to operate with relative freedom in less politicised sectors, but those engaged in food production and distribution, as well as the financial services sector, are at greater risk of state interference. The government will take a firm line against companies that they believe are raising retail prices too aggressively, in a futile effort to rein in triple-digit inflation.
The improvement in the score and ranking for policy towards private investment reflects expected improvements in policy stance under a new opposition-led administration later in the forecast period. This will be most evident in greater protection of property rights, a scaling back of the dominance of state-owned businesses across several sectors, as well as the start of a process of gradually scaling back price controls. However, none of these goals will be achievable immediately, as the dire economic situation precludes a blanket lifting of price controls, and improving competition policy would require a strengthening of competition and regulatory bodies. In the context of the institutional decay that has occurred in recent years and deep political polarisation, boosting Venezuela's ranking substantially in this area will be difficult, even under an opposition administration.

Policy under a successor government is likely to be much friendlier for investors
Venezuela's score and ranking for policy towards foreign investment improves between the historical and forecast period, reflecting anticipated changes in policy stance under a new opposition-led government. Until then, a very weak policy environment will undermine the score in this area. Although the 1999 constitution establishes national treatment for foreign capital, in practice Mr Maduro will prioritise investment from firms tied to, or owned by, friendly governments, thereby diminishing opportunities for other firms. The fact that the World Bank's International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes is currently considering dozens of cases lodged by companies affected by the nationalisation drive under Mr Chávez will prove a further disincentive to foreign companies, particularly as there is little indication that the Maduro regime has either the will or the ability to make compensation payments. With the fiscal accounts extremely weak in 2017-21-and with the government gradually withdrawing from international arbitration treaties-there is a possibility of outright confiscation under the Maduro government.
We expect an opposition-led administration to adopt a much friendlier approach towards foreign investment. The improvement in the score and ranking reflects our expectation that the risk of nationalisation and/or expropriation would be much lower under the next government, while government favouritism towards certain domestic firms, as well state firms from foreign allies, would decline. This would start to create a more level playing field for foreign investors.
Given the dominance of the oil sector, the next government is likely to focus on developing the vast, heavy-oil resources located in the Orinoco tar belt in order to reverse the recent slide in production. PDVSA lacks the capacity to boost production, so terms for foreign oil investors are likely to be reformed in order to increase the scope for private-sector participation.

Easing currency controls will prove difficult and will progress only slowly
We do not expect any improvement in conditions in this category between 2012-16 and 2017-21, as a result of which Venezuela falls slightly further in the global ranking. Although official policy towards foreign investors will improve under an opposition-led administration expected later in the forecast period, easing exchange controls will prove extremely challenging, with the process likely to be gradual. Even by the end of the forecast period, access to foreign currency is likely to be restricted, hampering foreign trade.
As long as Mr Maduro remains in power, he will retain stringent controls on foreign currency, with problems relating to the exchange regime representing a major barrier to foreign trade. Exchange controls (introduced in 2003) have been progressively tightened to strengthen the balance-of-payments position. In practice, the private sector has no access to the official rate, which was last devalued from BsF6.3:US$1 to BsF10:US$1 in March 2016. In theory, US dollars are available to purchase via a system known as Dicom at a rate of over BsF720:US$1, but demand massively outstrips supply, forcing many firms to either turn to the black market (on which the exchange rate is now over BsF5,000:US$1), or pare back or mothball operations in Venezuela. The result is a highly opaque multi-tier system that creates serious problems for private-sector importers. There is little sign that this convoluted foreign-exchange regime will ease until after a new government comes to power. Given the depth of distortions, there is a possibility that the country may be forced to dollarise or adopt a new domestic currency.
Difficulty in remitting profits earned in Venezuela will remain one of the most significant challenges of doing business for foreign companies operating in the country. Capital controls mean that official permission is required for such transactions, but with the government facing growing demand for US dollars, delays have accumulated in the system. Many foreign-owned companies have not been able to remit their profits for several years, which has had an impact on their overall financial performance, particularly as firms must now use the Dicom rate to value profits, which has weakened sharply in recent years. This has affected foreign companies across a variety of sectors, including airlines, auto manufacturers and retailers. Companies are increasingly choosing to mothball operations or wind down their presence in the Venezuelan market as a result. Given that we expect further devaluations of the Dicom rate, any eventual release of profits will mean that the foreign-currency value of these profits will be a fraction of their original value.
The government-already an inconsistent trade partner-is becoming increasingly isolated in terms of international trade. Venezuela was suspended from Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) in December 2016 for violating the body's democratic principles. The move will have little impact on current foreign trade flows, as Venezuela hardly exports anything to member countries, but it highlights a growing antipathy towards foreign trade agreements (the government made little effort to respond to the concerns of other member states, in fact criticising the body prior to Venezuela's suspension). Meanwhile, bilateral trade partners will continue to struggle in their relations with the Maduro government. Many have complained that Venezuela has not paid their suppliers; given shortages of foreign exchange, this trend is likely to continue. Red tape, corruption and inefficiency will also hinder trade, and corruption in the customs service will remain endemic.
Given severe fiscal constraints, there is a significant risk that Mr Maduro will revoke preferential trading and finance deals during the forecast period. During the 2004-08 oil boom, the Venezuelan government made a host of offers to other countries in the region, mainly in the form of cheap oil-financing deals, but also financial support for refinery and infrastructure construction projects. Little of this support is likely to materialise in 2017-21. Demand for domestic spending is likely to remain high-and oil output is falling as a result of years of underinvestment-so money for such international projects will be in short supply. Countries governed by radical left-wing administrations are less likely to have their trading preferences revoked; the oil-for-doctors swap with Cuba is expected to continue. PetroCaribe (an agreement with Caribbean and some Central American governments, allowing them to pay a fraction of the market oil price up front, spreading the remainder over a 25-year term at extremely low interest rates) is expected to remain in place at least in the short term, but, given that most of the signatory countries do not share the government's political stance, volumes will continue to decline. There is a substantial risk that the programme could be abandoned altogether.

Improvements in the tax regime are likely under an opposition government
The tax regime will remain a constraint to investment, but will undergo some minor improvements under an opposition-led government expected later in the forecast period. Rates of direct corporate taxation are currently moderate, with a top corporate income tax rate of 34% (excluding oil companies), but tax laws, regulations and procedures are complicated, inconsistent and subject to frequent arbitrary adjustments. A series of new taxes introduced in 2009 in many cases doubled the effective tax rate on earnings. These taxes formed part of wider reforms such as a sports law, a new science and technology law, a worker training law, and a municipal law, but included new fiscal charges on businesses, some of which are levied on gross revenue rather than net earnings. The measures are unlikely to be rolled back under the Maduro government, although a successor, opposition administration would be likely to reverse these changes.
The tax base is narrow: according to the latest official data, tax income accounted for just 13% of GDP in 2012. The failure to publish fiscal data since then suggests that tax income is likely to have shrunk in recent years. Despite the recent deterioration in the public finances, we do not believe that tax rises are likely under the current administration. Mr Maduro has shown little interest in raising revenue to offset massive increases in public spending and appears content with financing the huge fiscal deficit through public debt issuance, which is monetised, contributing to inflation. In addition, the president will be reluctant to pass measures that would further alienate his already-dwindling support base.
Based on our assumption that an opposition-led government will take over and begin enacting policy adjustments later in the forecast period, we expect it to seek a widening of the tax base to promote the development of a more stable system, but efforts would be focused at least initially on improving compliance-a difficult task, given the deterioration of state institutions over the course of the past 15 years.

Financing conditions will remain difficult
Venezuela's financing score remains unchanged, on the assumption that improvements in access to medium-term finance for the private sector, and in eliminating distortions, will occur only beyond the forecast period. Financial sector distortions are severe. The government has continued its policy of directed lending, which requires private banks to channel credit to specific sectors at preferential rates (including agriculture, mortgages and tourism). Bank credit has grown, but this reflects a lack of other investment alternatives in the context of captive domestic liquidity and triple-digit inflation. Nevertheless, the credit market remains comparatively shallow. For companies borrowing from local banks, credit remains predominantly short term. As only a small percentage of the population has sufficient funds to purchase investment and savings products, the capital market also remains shallow. Following a political transition, we expect interest rates to be gradually rationalised, but sector-specific measures will also be required and financing will remain a major weakness of the business environment throughout the forecast period.
The soundness of the financial system and the quality of regulation will remain key concerns. A bout of instability in 2009 prompted the government to take control of a number of small banks and brokerage houses. Although balance-sheet irregularities appeared to be the main motive, the problems stem-med from inadequate supervision by the Superintendencia de las Instituciones del Sector Bancario (the banking superintendency), which could have intervened at a much earlier stage to enforce existing regulations. The government passed new legislation in 2010, but this has not resulted in a tighter regulatory framework. In line with reform legislation passed in other sectors, the government has simply established a new layer of bureaucracy (in this case, a new regulatory oversight body), rather than trying to tackle the patchy enforce-ment of existing regulations. Weak skills in regulatory agencies and political meddling in oversight decision-making will remain problems, and will continue to undermine efforts to identify and support ailing banks at an early stage.
A removal of the many price, export, capital and foreign-exchange controls after an expected political transition would be particularly risky to the stability of the financial system, given the shocks that would result from sharp policy adjustments. Under this scenario, reforms would instead have to be introduced gradually in order to avoid creating systemic risks to the financial sector. This would require careful co-ordination with the country's banks to reduce pressures on the financial system when currency exchange controls are liberalised (which would involve rises in interest rates). The gradual lifting of the directed lending system would also allow for better allocation of resources and the medium-term stabilisation of interest rates.

Labour market rigidities will persist under the Maduro regime
Venezuela's labour market will remain among the least flexible in the world in 2017-21. Although a marginal improvement in the underlying score is expected, as a new government begins to take steps to ease the highly-regulated labour market, the process will be gradual and come only at the end of the forecast period, meaning that the impact on the overall score in 2017-21 will be very limited. The highly distorted exchange-rate system makes it virtually impossible to assess wage costs in US-dollar terms in comparison with the rest of the region. However, a 2012 labour reform increased non-wage costs considerably: obligatory non-wage costs, employers' social security contributions, mandatory profit sharing, and childcare and food allowances added more than 70% to the basic wage costs for large and medium-sized companies, and 30% for smaller companies. Owing to the accumulated real appreciation of the local currency over recent years, the relative cost of living is also rising. Under the assumption of a political transition, we expect some of the most egregiously restrictive regulations to be reformed later in the forecast period.
Wage and non-wage costs come on top of a long-standing firing freeze, under which staffing levels (excluding managers, short-term workers and high-income earners) can be reduced only via collective agreement. In practice, companies looking to shed staff are forced to negotiate "voluntary redundancy" agreements with workers; these typically centre on extremely generous severance payments, further adding to employment costs. Employment tribunals are generally hostile to private-sector employers, a factor used by workers and union representatives to their advantage. Moreover, companies that make recourse to voluntary redundancies have at times been targeted for nationalisation, representing a further disincentive for the private sector.
Finding skilled labour is likely to remain problematic even under an opposition-led government, as the results of decades of underinvestment in education will take time to reverse, meaning that even basic skills will remain scarce in much of the workforce. Chronic underinvestment in scientific and technical skills, as well as political interference in universities and technical colleges, has damaged the quality of the country's tertiary education system. Professionals with good employment prospects abroad, in particular in the energy sector, as well as software engineers, doctors and other medical staff, university lecturers, and teachers, have fled the country en masse, leaving behind an acute skills shortage. Although some are more likely to return to the country under an opposition-led government, this is unlikely during the 2017-21 forecast period, as they are likely to wait until the political and economic situation stabilises before returning.

Underinvestment will cause many services to deteriorate
Relatively speaking, infrastructure was one of the strongest areas of Venezuela's overall business environment during the historical period. The country was a comparatively early adopter of a national electricity grid and modern ports, airports and telecommunications (which account for half of the infrastructure score). However, years of underinvestment are causing the quality of most services to deteriorate and both the score and ranking are forecast to fall during the 2017-21 forecast period. Overall, capital expenditure will remain significantly lower in the forecast period than during the historical period, reflecting fiscal constraints. Given the long-term horizon of investment in most infrastructure projects, the highly uncertain policy outlook will dissuade private investors. Despite repeated pledges by the government to implement ambitious infrastructure projects, state-led investment under Mr Maduro will be erratic, and most plans are unlikely to advance. A post-transition government will be keen on making up the shortfalls but fiscal constraints will make it extremely difficult to raise infra-structure spending, although some multilateral assistance should be provided.
The power network accounts for only a small share of the infrastructure score, but reliable access to electricity will be one of the main causes for concern for businesses operating in Venezuela in 2017-21. Frozen nominal electricity tariffs have led to rapid growth in demand in recent years. Water levels at the Guri dam-which generates most of the country's hydropower (which, in turn, accounts for 60% of total electricity generation)-have recovered from critically low levels a year ago, but with little new capacity coming on stream, the country will remain highly exposed to drought. The government's repeated pledges to invest in the power sector are unlikely to materialise, so the long-standing standing problem of a weak transmission and distribution network will remain unaddressed during the forecast period, meaning that electricity rationing and unscheduled blackouts will remain a risk.
Although the physical airport infrastructure remains reasonable-the capital's Maiquetia airport is relatively modern-government policies complicate air travel. Long delays in authorising the remittance of international air carriers' profits outs of Venezuela have prompted several carriers to reduce or suspend services. The reduced service coupled with firm demand (as Venezuelans have sought to travel overseas in order to bring US dollars back into the country, where they can sell them on the black market) has sent airfare prices soaring.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
It is unlikely that the government will be able to manage the build-up of inflationary and currency depreciation pressures without some sort of policy adjustment between now and the presidential election. We assume that the Maduro government will be forced to weaken the currency more substantially in 2017-18 than it did last year. However, other much-needed reforms are unlikely to be addressed by a government that has proved unwilling or unable to adjust policy sufficiently to move Venezuela's economy away from the brink of collapse. Fiscal and monetary policies will remain expansionary, and ad hoc policy interventionism and heavy state control of the economy will persist. Slightly higher oil prices than in 2014-16 will bring some relief, but import compression will remain necessary, as other sources of foreign exchange will be hard to find. International reserves totalled US$10.1bn in early May, far below historical levels, and down by about 20% year on year. Even after a 2016 restructuring of debt owed by PDVSA, the state-owned oil firm, substantial external debt payments are falling due in 2017-18. We currently expect Venezuela to meet its 2017 obligations, which are mostly owed by PDVSA (it made a US$2.1bn coupon payment in April). However, given the extremely thin reserves cushion, the risk of default remains high; this would have dramatic economic and political consequences in the form of a sharp decrease in oil production, reduced import capacity, hyperinflation and political turmoil.
We expect the opposition to take power in 2019, ushering in much-needed market-driven adjustments designed to correct currency distortions, alleviate shortages of basic goods, tighten expansionary fiscal policy and rebuild institutional capacity after years of deterioration under PSUV rule. It is probable, given the scale of the challenge, that the new government will seek a financing agreement with the IMF to support the adjustment process; we have factored in accumulated lending of over US$16bn in 2019-21. Efforts to secure increased inflows of foreign direct investment would also be likely under a new government, and would help to improve the balance-of-payments dynamics, although we expect direct investors to remain cautious for some time with regards to Venezuela, with the possible exception of the oil sector.

The authorities' failure to publish data on the non-financial public sector since 2012 demonstrates the opacity of the public finances and complicates accurate forecasting of the size of the deficit. After ballooning to an estimated 24.3% of GDP in 2016, we expect the deficit to stand at a still-large 19.6% of GDP in 2017 and remain in double digits in 2018. The election of a new government should help to ease the deficit to 6% of GDP by 2021. The large deficits of the present are mostly being financed by printing money; the money supply (M2) rose by 230% year on year in April, the highest rate on record. Meanwhile, high inflation and an overvalued currency are eroding the relative value of domestic and external debt, making debt/GDP ratios unreliable indicators of fiscal stability.

There is considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing, mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA. As these items are excluded from the public debt statistics, the true size of total public liabilities is understated. In 2016 the government undertook a bond swap that saw around US$2.8bn of PDVSA debt due in 2017 pushed out to 2020. Even after this deal, we continue to see an extremely high risk of default, although the government has emphasised its commitment to pay, and we expect the next administration to follow through with its debt-servicing and repayment obligations.

Monetary policy under the Banco Central de Venezuela (the central bank) will continue to be driven by the government's desire to keep real interest rates negative and to print money to finance large fiscal deficits. Amid extremely high inflation, we expect real rates to remain deeply negative in 2017-18. From 2019 our forecast of substantial currency and fiscal adjustment under a new government also implies a substantial tightening of monetary policy. We expect interest rates to rise sharply that year, declining only moderately thereafter.

Ongoing disruption to Venezuela's productive base and a collapse in consumer spending mean that, after a massive contraction in GDP in 2016 (estimated at 14%), we project a further contraction, of 6.4%, in 2017 (this represents a downward revision from last month, reflecting a slight downward revision to our oil production forecast and the impact on activity of ongoing widespread protests). We do not expect the government to make the necessary adjustments to bring about economic recovery, and expect recession to persist into 2019. Our forecast for a recovery in 2020-21 rests on our assumption of slightly higher oil prices, alongside a political transition that produces a combination of macroeconomic adjustment (supported by IMF financial assistance), and institutional and structural reform. However, reform will take time to bear fruit, given the scale of the recession, and our forecasts therefore imply only a partial rebound, after a decline in real GDP of nearly 30% in 2014-19.
After dropping by an estimated 20.2% in 2016, private consumption will contract further in 2017-18, reflecting the impact of soaring inflation on real wages and disposable incomes, as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will continue to contract sharply, reflecting the difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange, and remitting profits. Our forecast for a recovery in invest-ment in 2019-21 is based on expectations of a political transition, progress on long­delayed joint projects with Chinese firms in the energy sector and-towards the end of the forecast period-a pick-up in public-sector investment. Exports will continue to shrink in 2017 as oil production falls further, but will pick up in 2019-21, reflecting increased investment under a new government and a removal of constraints to domestic production. Import demand will rise faster than exports, in line with an alleviation of basic goods shortages and the release of pent-up demand from the recession years. Even after the change in govern-ment, however, dependence on oil will persist.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Oil sector: With proven levels approaching 300m barrels, Venezuela has the largest reserves in the world, making it a major oil producer and exporter. However, the energy sector has suffered from disinvestment and mismanage-ment owing to political interference. The state is accorded exclusive ownership of PDVSA and its subsidiaries. Since 2007 oil exploration, extraction and storage activities have been reserved for state-owned enterprises or companies in which the state holds a stake of at least 51%. The level of oil output in Venezuela in recent years has been the subject of debate by national and international sources, with the latter reporting production levels significantly below PDVSA's estimates. PDVSA has long insisted that oil production stands at around 3m barrels/day (b/d). This figure is higher than its own reports to OPEC, and well above independent estimates, including the 2.03m b/d calculated by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in March 2017, (we use the IEA's series in our forecasts). Under an OPEC quota deal in late 2016, which we expect to be renewed in May 2017, Venezuela is expected to reduce output to close to 2m b/d, thus still not complying entirely with its quota of 1.97m b/d. In March the authorities announced that production would be reduced in several extra-heavy fields, including joint-ventures with Rosneft, the Russian state oil firm, in order to abide by the OPEC quota. This suggests that OPEC is putting more pressure on Venezuela to improve compliance.
The government claims that rising investment in the energy sector will lift oil production significantly in the medium term, but we foresee continued low levels, before production begins to rise again in 2019, although this is subject to the considerable risk of a steeper than forecast fall and a slower recovery. In recent years, PDVSA has signed agreements with a Russian consortium, including Gazprom and Lukoil, and with the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC, the Chinese state oil company) to develop various blocks in the Orinoco tar belt (where the majority of Venezuela's untapped reserves are located). It has also established a US$2bn financing deal with Chevron (US) and a joint venture with Eni (Italy) for a refinery. However, these plans are likely to progress very slowly, owing to financing and regulatory hurdles, which will limit any significant rise in production.
In the light of significant fiscal restraints, PDVSA investment in new exploration and production has been very limited, and the company will struggle to meet production targets, as it continues to act as a major financier of the government's social programmes. PDVSA's investment budget will continue to be compromised by large compensation payments to foreign oil companies and by repayments on the company's increasingly large debt stock (which represents a considerable share of the public sector's total obligations). As a result of its chronic payments difficulties, PDVSA's relations with its foreign partners have been turbulent over the past year. For example, Schlumberger, a US-based oil services firm, announced in 2016 that it would curtail its activities in Venezuela owing to lack of payments. Other foreign suppliers could follow suit in the light of PDVSA's financial constraints, although the company will try and avoid this, in order to maintain its good standing and demonstrate its commitment to pay.
Overall, the Venezuelan oil sector will remain very challenging for foreign companies under a PSUV-led government, with the possibility of repeated contract revisions and the very weak legal framework acting as major constraints. Moreover, most private firms are likely to face unfair competition, stemming from the government's ideological preference for PDVSA to work with state-owned companies from friendly governments. Although the great potential for growth in the Orinoco tar belt and the massive investment and expertise needed to develop these reserves will provide some opportunities for private participation, this is unlikely to materialise while global oil prices stay low, the country's economic crisis deepens and the risk of domestic turbulence remains high ahead of an expected political transition.

A decimation of domestic supply and severe shortages of foreign-exchange reserves have caused inflation to soar for much of the past two years, and in the short term there is little sign that the situation will improve, despite deep reces-sion. No new official inflation data have been released since end-2015, but the National Assembly has since the start of the year begun producing a consumer price index. This showed monthly inflation at 16.2% in March, bringing accumu-lated inflation for January-March to 65.5%. Assuming that price pressures remain high in the first half of 2017 at least, we expect average inflation to be higher this year, at 562%, than in 2016. However, we continue to forecast a decline in inflation over time, reflecting moderately higher oil prices-which will bring in the necessary foreign exchange to help to alleviate scarcity of goods-and the impact of persistent recession on demand. From 2019 fiscal and monetary policy adjustment will also be supportive of a gradual reduction in inflation towards double-digit levels (in year-on-year terms). However, for now, a lack of funds available for importing basic goods suggests that shortages will be rife, and the risk of hyperinflation (monthly inflation of over 50%) will remain substantial.

Amid huge pressures on the dual-currency exchange-rate system, our forecasts assume substantial devaluations in 2017-18, but the exchange rate will still be extremely overvalued. The dual exchange-rate system is composed of an official peg, known as the Dipro, which is limited to priority public-sector imports and set at BsF10:US$1, and a heavily managed rate known as the Dicom. The Dicom rate weakened by 70% in nominal terms in 2016 and stands at BsF720:US$1 currently, but it accounts for less than 10% of all official transactions. In real terms, the average exchange rate (weighted by volume of transactions) continued to appreciate substantially in 2016, creating ever greater pressure for currency adjustment, the need for which is evident in the black-market rate; this stood at BsF5,100:US$1 in early May.
The pegged Dipro rate appears increasingly unsustainable, and we assume that the government will devalue the rate to BsF25:US$1 later this year and again in 2018 (to BsF500:US$1). We also assume that the government will increase the share of Dicom in foreign-currency transactions to 50% by 2018, up from a current level of about 8% (in effect a maxi-devaluation). We assume that further major currency adjustment under a new, MUD-led government in 2019 will involve immediate exchange-rate unification. In the meantime, given existing distortions in the foreign-exchange market, there is an extremely high risk of a debilitating currency crisis in the short term. If confidence in the bolívar collapses amid hyperinflation, dollarisation-or the launch of a new domestic currency-could occur.

The current-account deficit will narrow further in 2017-18, reflecting severe import compression and a moderate recovery in oil prices, which will outweigh a continued gradual decline in oil output. The deficit will widen thereafter on the assumption that economic recovery draws in imports on a large scale after years of pent-up demand and in line with an easing of external financing constraints. Our assumption of economic adjustment in the medium term suggests some recovery in capital inflows, particularly into the oil sector. Together with IMF loans, this should help to rebuild reserves coverage, although our forecasts assume that even by the end of the forecast period in 2021, reserves will cover only slightly more than three months of goods and services imports.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Venezuela
Stocks and flows
According to the IMF (whose figures differ somewhat from local sources), the stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) stood at US$32.2bn in 2015, the last year in which actual data has been provided. This is around one-third less than a peak of US$48.9bn in 2007 and is primarily the result of significant disinvestment, notwithstanding the government's strict capital controls. The stock of FDI has also plummeted as a share of GDP terms, dropping from a peak of nearly 50% of GDP in 2003 to just 6.8% in 2015. Overall, FDI inflows have been very volatile in the past 15 years, affected by both political and macroeconomic factors. During the oil opening of 1996-98, inward FDI peaked at an annual average of US$4bn a year (5% of GDP). By historical standards, inward FDI held up well in the first three years of the presidency of Hugo Chávez (1999-2013), averaging US$3.8bn per year in 1999-2001. As political conflict intensified, FDI inflows began to decline in 2002-08 (averaging US$1.6bn per year), and in 2009-a year of great volatility in the world economy and adverse domestic developments in Venezuela-the country registered disinvestment of US$1bn (some negative inflows were also the result of compensation for nationalisations). Inward FDI has recovered since then, averaging an estimated US$4.5bn per year in 2011-13, as a result of greater investment from China in energy and housing. It declined considerably in 2014, to just US$390m, as the economy entered recession, but picked up again in 2015 to US$3.8bn. Outbound FDI in Venezuela is considerable, reaching a stock of US$28.9bn in 2014. However, this tally is dominated almost entirely by investments abroad by PDVSA, the state oil company.
Origin and distribution
The energy sector, and oil in particular, remains the main magnet for FDI. US and European oil companies have major investments in the country, even after forced changes to the ownership structure of most contracts. After oil, banking and communications have been the main recipients of FDI. Spanish banks have the largest foreign presence in the financial sector, although the Venezuelan state has bought back some operations. Other notable FDI inflows come from Chile (in forestry activities) and Canada (in the mining industry). In recent years Venezuela has courted new investment partners in Brazil, China, Russia and Iran, with limited success. Domestic economic problems in most of these countries mean that short-term efforts will be focused on seeking investment from China and Russia (PDVSA has joint-ventures with Rosneft, the Russian state oil firm).
Determinants
Following a period of booming FDI inflows in the 1990s, driven by oil and telecommunications openings, an uncertain political and policy environment-including threats of nationalisation-and a volatile macroeconomic climate have served to keep FDI well below potential, particularly in the non-extractive sectors. In the extractive sector, FDI inflows have been affected by the government's restrictive hydrocarbons investment regime. This partly reverses the oil opening of the 1990s by mandating that PDVSA must hold a minimum 51% stake in most activities, and raises the national take from taxes and royalties in the sector. Further investment in this sector has been hampered by the generally unfavourable outlook for global oil prices in the short term. Although Venezuela's oil production costs are among the lowest in the world, extra heavy crude from larger fields like the Orinoco tar belt (which holds the bulk of reserves) are far more expensive, averaging around US$60-100/barrel. The sharp contraction of non-energy economic activity and severe weaknesses in the business environment have hampered inward FDI outside of the oil sector.
Impact
Foreign investment in oil brought accelerated growth in output, from 2.4m barrels/day (b/d) in 1994 to a peak of 3.4m b/d in 1999. Foreign investment in the extractive sector has fallen since then, contributing to a decline in oil output, reinforced by PDVSA's inability to drive production. Foreign involvement has had a less dramatic impact in other sectors, such as domestic manufacturing or services, but this in turn has resulted in high levels of import dependence. As FDI has flowed mostly into capital-intensive industries, its impact on employment and skills levels has been limited.
Potential
Potentially attractive opportunities for FDI exist in an array of sectors, such as oil and gas (of which Venezuela possesses the largest reserves in the world), petrochemicals, coal, aluminium, gold, forestry, power, tourism and telecoms. There is additional potential in some manufacturing and agricultural niches (for example, leather goods, cocoa and rum). Further comparative attractions are Venezuela's transport infrastructure, which is still fairly good by regional standards, and the country's strategic geographic location. However, FDI inflows will be severely curtailed by concerns over the government's policy stance, difficulties in accessing foreign exchange, the weak macroeconomic environment and the fragility of the legal framework. Nonetheless, some investment from non-traditional sources, particularly China, is set to continue in the short and medium term. A more noticeable upturn in FDI inflows will have to wait until after a political transition takes place, insofar as the new government undertakes a commitment to improve the business environment, address exchange-rate distortions and bring down inflation from current triple-digit levels.

Although Venezuela appears to be a middle-income country, a sharply overvalued exchange rate artificially inflates US-dollar income measurements. In dollar terms, and using a weighted average of the country's official exchange rates, we estimate that GDP per head stood at US$18,360 in 2016, well above the average for the Latin American region. Estimates using purchasing power parity (PPP) give a lower figure of US$14,625. Using the black-market exchange rate (over BsF5,000:US$1 in early May 2017) as a basis for these calculations would result in a significantly lower GDP per head figure, however. Given the country's ongoing recession, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects GDP per head and disposable incomes to fall in the medium term, before beginning to pick up in PPP terms from 2020. These forecasts are based on the benign assumption that a forecast political transition materialises without severe economic disruption, and that growth recovers thereafter.
Several factors will restrict purchasing power, including triple-digit consumer price inflation, and persistently high levels of poverty and income inequality. Although national statistics show a dramatic improvement in social indicators in recent years, the data have been disputed, and independent studies have suggested that inequality has not fallen as quickly as the government indicates, and that the middle-income class has shrunk. According to the UN Human Development Programme, 6.6% of the population survived on less than US$1.25/day (in purchasing-power terms) in 2012, a higher proportion than in almost any other country in the region.
Investment potential will only be tapped after a political transition
Venezuela is a reasonably-sized consumer market and has the potential to become an attractive investment location, although this will have to wait until a more market-friendly administration takes over from the PSUV. The country has vast reserves of natural resources (including oil, gas, coal and precious metals), an array of spectacular natural tourist attractions, relatively good physical infrastructure and a fairly favourable geographical location given its proximity to the US. However, poor economic policies have contributed to a volatile GDP profile and a deterioration of public services and human capital over the past two decades. The unattractiveness of the business environment is compounded by inadequate contract and property rights. Moreover, continued high poverty levels and a deterioration in health-care and education provision in the past three decades have contributed to an erosion of skills and productivity, which has also been exacerbated by the exodus of talented individuals to work abroad.

A weakened productive base will sustain demand for imported goods
In common with the rest of the Latin American region, spending on food, beverages and tobacco accounts for the largest share of total consumer expenditure, and this will remain the case throughout the forecast period. Sharp growth in mobile-telephone usage and an underdeveloped urban public transport system (which has boosted car ownership) are the main factors behind the relatively heavy weighting of expenditure on transport and communications. Most consumer goods industries will remain under-developed, a legacy of "Dutch disease", whereby dependence on energy exports leads to currency appreciation and therefore a lack of competitiveness in manufacturing exports, with a consequent decline of the latter sector. Furthermore, shortages of foreign exchange have led to import controls, resulting in a scarcity of consumer goods that are not produced domestically.
The scale of the country's ongoing recession will lead to major contraction in retail sales volumes throughout most of the forecast period, and only a modest improvement from 2020. Despite a forecast maxi-devaluation in 2018-29, the bolivar will still be overvalued, so sales in US dollar terms are not an accurate indicator of consumer demand.

Political transition will help to boost growth, but only in the long term
The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term outlook is based upon a transition to a government (in 2019) that pursues sounder policies and improves the business environment. However, despite the prospects of a more market-friendly government and the gradual elimination of the country's economic distortions, long-term growth will remain under-whelming, and will continue to be subject to boom and bust cycles linked to the oil market. We therefore project that Venezuela's real GDP will grow by an average of just 2.1% in 2017-50 (this figure is influenced by a contraction in 2017-18); growth will average 2.4% in 2031-50). Among the factors comprising long-term GDP growth, human capital will expand the most firmly, by a forecast 1.8% per year in 2015-50, mainly reflecting a fairly healthy demographic profile. However, very weak institutions, oil dependency and a weak productive base (made worse by severe mismanagement during the era of Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela-PSUV-government) will remain significant barriers to growth.
Initial conditions: After averaging growth of 10% in 2004-08, real GDP fell sharply in 2009-10. Although the economy recovered in 2011-12 on the back of aggressive fiscal spending, growth slowed sharply again in 2013, with the economy slipping into a deepening recession in late 2014. We estimate that by the time the economy returns to growth in 2020, it will have lost around 30% of real GDP, making the recession the country's most severe in recent history (technically a depression). The heterodox policy framework that has been in place for over a decade has been a major factor in hampering GDP growth, while an opaque and distorted exchange-rate system has provided opportunities for corruption on a large scale, further undermining the institutional framework and maintaining income inequality. Given the sharp deterioration in conditions in recent years, there is potential for improvement in the policy and political environment in the long term under an opposition administration, but there is significant risk of an outright economic collapse before then (or afterwards, if the transition is particularly chaotic). In addition, institutional deterioration is very deep-rooted and will prove harder to reverse.
On a more positive note, a higher skills base and reasonably good infrastructure by regional standards provide scope for faster overall growth and a rise in personal incomes. Nevertheless, underinvestment in human capital and infrastructure is eroding these advantages and, given growing fiscal difficulties, this trend will take time to reverse. Successive governments have failed to take advantage of Venezuela's proximity to developed US and European markets relative to its South American neighbours, as internal geography and a lack of investment in infrastructure in the interior have limited Venezuela's chances of becoming a regional hub for transport and commerce.
Demographic trends: As in most other emerging-market countries, growth in the working-age population will slow in the long term, while rising partici-pation rates will ensure that the labour force will grow at an even brisker pace. The dependency ratio of old to young will remain low by comparison to OECD levels in 2050. Even with life expectancy growing steadily, the share of the population aged 65 and over will be only around 16% in 2050 (although rising from 6.8% in 2016), while the proportion of the population at working age will remain high, at just under 65%. A particular risk to productivity is the brain-drain seen in recent years as many experienced professionals have left the country to work abroad with no guarantee of returning, even after economic conditions stabilise following a change in government.
Diversifying away from oil will be one of the key long-term challenges
External conditions: Oil, which currently accounts for almost 90% of export revenue and around one-quarter of GDP, will continue to dominate the Venezuelan economy. However, there will be an effort to diversify the productive base in the long term, given the severe consequences of the economy's dependency on oil (particularly on the external and fiscal balances). During the Hugo Chávez (1999-2013) and Nicolás Maduro eras Venezuela and its allies have taken a confrontational stance against US policy and US-led efforts at economic integration. This will end once a new government is in power, which will result in an economic rapprochement with some of its faster growing neighbours, such as Colombia and Peru. It will also signal the end of programmes such as PetroCaribe, which was largely used to boost the country's regional influence and was financially viable only as a result of historically high oil prices. A gradual real devaluation of the exchange rate will be necessary for Venezuela to be competitive in non-commodity sectors, as will be the need to remove state control over key productive sectors that have export potential. Capital control, trade restrictions and other barriers currently designed to keep foreign currency from leaking out will gradually be pared down as well, although further liberalisation of trade is unlikely to be a priority for the next government until well into the next decade. In the meantime, links with Asia will be strengthened, and the country's close relationship with China is not likely to be compromised, given that country's significant investment potential.
Institutions and policy trends: Under the assumption of an end to PSUV rule in 2019, our long-term forecast assumes that there will be a gradual improvement to the policy environment. We assume that some of the most distortionary elements of the current policy framework, including price and exchange controls, will be scaled back gradually, reducing the large black-market exchange-rate premium and increasing economic openness by the end of the long-term forecast period. However, the prospects for improvements in other aspects of the business environment are less encouraging, given that they will take far longer to address. For example, strengthening of the non-oil public finances will prove unfeasible until the economy is sufficiently diversified. Given that the economy will still be highly vulnerable to the fluctuations of the price of oil, the fiscal position will remain highly pro-cyclical. An overhaul of the overstaffed and inefficient bureaucracy will be difficult to achieve, even if the opposition comes to power, owing to the political costs of redundancies. Within the context of a deficient administrative framework, progress in reforming social security and labour legislation will be slow at best, as the new government will want to retain some of its powers of patronage in order to avoid a loss of support from the withdrawal of Chávez-era benefits. Endemic corruption and politicisation will be difficult to root out, even assuming other improvements in the policy environment.
The economy will remain vulnerable to external shocks and cycles
Long-term performance: Even once the most distortionary elements of current economic policy are abandoned, the deterioration of the skills base over the past decade will mean that Venezuela's potential GDP growth will have been eroded, although there is still some scope for recovery in 2021-30, when growth will average a respectable 3.3%. It will then slow down to an average of 2.4% in 2031-50. A higher trend rate of GDP growth would be possible in the event that a significant change in the policy direction is coupled with more favourable external conditions (mainly oil prices) than currently forecast, thereby allowing for rapid and thorough implementation of much-needed structural reforms. Under our baseline scenario, however, achieving reforms beyond those necessary for a post-transition adjustment will prove very complicated. As it is, the overall economy will remain vulnerable to continuing cycles of boom and bust, with negative consequences for macroeconomic stability and growth, as well as constraining the prospects for catch-up with more developed economies, despite some solid projected growth late in the forecast period. The key variables to a successful turnaround will be the degree to which the economy is diversified from oil and whether the business environment improves to the point that domestic and external investment become key drivers of growth.

Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines ten separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, and infrastructure. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 16 (infrastructure), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2012-16) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2017-21). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2012-16. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2017-21 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
The main sources used in the business rankings model include CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce; Freedom House, Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties; Heritage Foundation, Index of Economic Freedom; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; UN, Human Development Report; US Social Security Administration, Social Security Programs Throughout the World; World Bank, World Development Report; World Development Indicators; Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Report.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2012-16 ranges are then used to derive 2017-21 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2017-21, not to the likely situation in 2021 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2014 or 2019). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text:   Country forecast overview: Highlights
Formal political opposition to the regime will remain marginal. Vladimir Putin, the president, is likely to run again for president in March 2018 and win with a large majority in the first round. The principal concern for the authorities will be to maintain a high turnout in the absence of a meaningful contest.
Donald Trump, the new US president, has expressed a desire to improve relations with Russia. However, the likelihood of a significant rapprochement has declined following a US strike on a Syrian airbase in early April.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects US and EU sectoral sanctions on the Russian defence, energy and financial sectors to remain in place in the medium term. Russian counter sanctions on Western food imports will also remain in place indefinitely.
Despite a reduction in fighting in Ukraine, we do not expect the Minsk II deal to lead to a comprehensive political settlement. Ukraine will not regain full control of its border with Russia.
Russia is likely to remain a mobilisation economy, characterised by high spending on the defence sector, a cautious approach to foreign investment in many sectors, protectionism and a large role for the state in the economy.
The government is unlikely to implement disruptive market reforms. Minority stakes in some major state enterprises will be sold off. Chinese companies are likely to take a bigger role in the economy, including in the extractive sector.
Despite pressure to maintain defence and welfare spending, the government will cut public expenditure in 2017-19 to keep the budget deficit under control. The budget deficit will narrow to less than 1% of GDP by 2021, from 3.4% of GDP in 2016.
The economy contracted by 0.2% in 2016. We forecast that the economy will grow by 1.6% in 2017, supported by higher oil prices and improving consumer confidence. Investment will remain relatively weak, and public spending will be tightened further.
The medium-term growth outlook will be constrained by structural weaknesses, including a lack of competition, high state involvement in the economy, an ageing and declining workforce, and weak rule of law. We forecast average annual GDP growth of 1.6% per year in 2017-21.

Russia falls by two places in our regional ranking in the forecast period (2017-21), to 15th out of 16 countries. This reflects manifold institutional weaknesses, poor rule of law, high levels of corruption and extensive state involve-ment in the economy. It falls to 69th out of 82 countries in our global ranking.
Country forecast overview: Russia's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Privatisation plans will proceed slowly, despite the announcement in 2016 of a new privatisation drive.
2019-21: Overall state involvement in the economy remains high. Government interference in private companies remains arbitrary. Rent-seeking officials remain a burden on business. Protection of intellectual property rights could weaken.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: International sanctions and low energy prices discourage major new investment in the oil and gas sectors.
2019-21: The "pivot to the east" will lead to further moderate growth in investment from Asia.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Western sanctions remain in place. Membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is effectively suspended. The Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) internal market is undermined by exemptions and weak enforcement.
2019-21: The difficulty of trading across borders continues to be a weakness. The Russian ban on Western agricultural imports is likely to remain in force.
Taxes
2017-18: The resources tax on gas and the tax on tobacco rise. The freeze on the tax on vodka is extended. Direct taxes on in-dividuals and value-added tax (VAT) will not be raised, and the government may issue VAT concessions to selected sectors.
2019-21: A progressive consumption tax might be introduced. Tax inspections remain a burden on business. The time that it takes to pay taxes is close to international norms. There are some specific improvements in the corporate tax regime.
Financing
2017-18: International sanctions limit access to external capital markets, significantly raising the cost of financing.
2019-21: International financial integration proceeds slowly. The banking system remains weak and state dominated. The government maintains its commitment to bail out systemically important institutions.
The labour market
2017-18: Spending on education is cut further. The incidence of strikes increases slightly, although the labour movement remains weak.
2019-21: The indigenous labour force will steadily decline; however, the impact will be offset in some sectors by continued substantial immigration from the Commonwealth of Independent States, much of it unskilled.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Budget constraints curb investment in infrastructure. Politically important projects are prioritised, but even here cuts are made. Russia struggles to obtain international funding for its infrastructure projects. Roads are starved of funding.
2019-21: It remains difficult to secure foreign finance. China provides only a limited alternative to Western funding.

a Actual. b Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: The transition to a market economy in the early 1990s was accompanied by a collapse in industrial production and a sharp drop in living standards. A contested privatisation process led to a highly concentrated ownership structure. Executive weakness and bureaucratic dysfunction contributed to a sharp decentralisation of power. After becoming president in 2000, Vladimir Putin sought to restore central control over the regions and tame independent corporate interests. Mr Putin presided over a period of strong economic growth in his first two terms. His re-election as president in 2012 has heralded the development of a more authoritarian domestic environment.
Political structure: Boris Yeltsin won the first democratic presidential election in June 1991 and was re-elected in July 1996. Repeated confrontations with the legislature culminated in the dissolution of parliament in September 1993 and a violent showdown the following month. The powers of the executive were greatly increased by a new constitution, adopted in 1993. Mr Putin was elected in March 2000 and re-elected for a second term in March 2004. Mr Putin's second term in office was characterised by increasing centralisation of the state. A loyal ally, Dmitry Medvedev, won the presidential election in March 2008 and took over in May of that year. Mr Putin returned to the presidency for a third term in May 2012. Following a constitutional change, his term will last six years, to 2018.
Policy issues: Mr Putin's third term as president has seen a greater emphasis on "conservative cultural values", anti-Westernism and great-power nationalism. The stand-off with the West is leading to a rollback of Russia's integration into the world economy. This is likely to strengthen further the state's role in the economy. Tit-for-tat sanctions have encouraged the government to focus on import substitution. The focus on curbing "foreign influence" on domestic politics is likely to endure, along with close controls on civil society, the internet and media.
Taxation: Reforms since 2000 have aimed to rationalise the tax system and cut the number of taxes and the corporate tax burden. Changes to the tax regime in January 2001 included the introduction of a flat rate of personal income tax of 13% and a simplification of the administration of social security contributions. In 2004 the basic rate of value-added tax (VAT) was reduced from 20% to 18% and a regional 5% sales tax was abolished. The corporate tax rate was cut from 24% to 20% at the beginning of 2009. The government has pledged not to raise personal or consumption taxes before 2018.
Foreign trade: Mainly because of high international oil prices, export revenue has soared since 2000. Import growth picked up over the same period as a result of rising real incomes and real rouble appreciation. Merchandise exports totalled just over US$280bn in 2016 and imports were just over US$190bn. Oil and gas account for around two-thirds of Russia's exports, with metals contributing around one-tenth.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
Vladimir Putin's third presidential term, which began in 2012, has seen a shift towards "conservative cultural values", a more authoritarian political culture and more overt anti­Westernism. This has been further consolidated by Russia's confrontation with the West over Ukraine. Despite some pro-market rhetoric, economic policy has grown more statist and protectionist. The leadership will remain preoccupied by the need to insulate the economy and society from foreign-in particular Western-influence and the perceived threat of externally sponsored regime change. However, the regime is characterised by ideological flexibility and is more adaptable than many observers acknowledge. If the external environment allows (a major caveat), it is possible that the leadership will devote greater attention to domestic issues and welfare after the 2018 presidential election and attempt to implement a slightly more liberal economic agenda. Concern about political stability is likely to hold the government back from pursuing radical reform.
The forecast period (2017-21) is likely to be characterised by relatively slow growth in living standards, following a major decline in 2015-16 and further cuts in public expenditure in many areas. This contrasts sharply with the rapid growth achieved in Mr Putin's first decade in power and could have unpredict-able effects on stability in the medium term. However, there currently seems to be little desire for disruptive reform among the broader population, and the potential for mass protest or major political change from below appears to be low. Social controls have been tightened since 2012, and the opposition has been marginalised and demoralised. Protests regularly occur across the country, but these tend to be focused on single issues; the cost for individuals and activists of collective action focused on broader political change is high. The government tends to respond constructively when confronted with specific economic grievances. A mixture of state support and administrative pressure will keep major enterprises operating in provincial industrial towns.
The regime is actively engaged in cadre renewal at many levels. Nevertheless, the political system leans heavily on the charismatic leadership and popularity of Mr Putin. There is therefore a risk of a rupture when he departs the political scene. The weakness of most political and legal institutions, as well as the person-alised, opaque governance system around Mr Putin, could present difficulties in managing an eventual presidential transition. Any successor is likely to come from the team around Mr Putin and will not herald a sharp change in the policy agenda. However, it may be difficult for any successor to build popular legitimacy given the weak economic outlook. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect a political transition in the forecast period. Speculation about an eventual succession strategy is likely to intensify soon after the 2018 presidential election, however, and this will further depress business confidence and raise political uncertainty.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
The next presidential election will take place in March 2018. We expect Mr Putin to contest the election and win by a wide margin in the first round. Aleksei Navalny, an anti-corruption blogger and nationalist opposition politician, will be barred from participating in the presidential election following a second conviction for defrauding Kirovles, a timber company. This suggests that the authorities intend to run a tightly controlled contest, offering voters no meaningful alternatives to Mr Putin. The main challenge for the authorities will be to prevent a sharp fall in turnout, which would throw doubt on the legitimacy of Mr Putin's popular mandate. This is one of the reasons behind the efforts to revitalise the regional leadership with the replacement of poorly performing governors.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
The Ukraine conflict has led to a sharp deterioration in Russia's relations with the West since 2014. In response to the conflict in Ukraine, the US and the EU have imposed sanctions on senior Russian officials and the Russian financial, energy and defence sectors. Russia has responded with a ban on almost all Western food imports.
The Minsk II ceasefire agreement, signed in February 2015, is highly unlikely to lead to a comprehensive political resolution of the conflict in Ukraine. The constitutional reform mandated by the agreement, which could formally embed Russia's proxies within Ukraine's political system, is politically toxic in Ukraine. In the highly unlikely event that it is passed, there is little chance that Russia will allow Ukraine to re-establish control of its side of the international border. Russia sees Ukrainian integration with the EU and NATO as a direct threat to its national interests. Russia will not step back from its long-term objective of preventing a pro-Western govern-ment from consolidating in Ukraine. The current status quo, of a regularly breached ceasefire with contained levels of fighting, appears likely to endure for several years.
It appears unlikely that the plans of the US president, Donald Trump, to reconfigure relations with Russia will be realised, given strong resistance from the US security establishment. Allegations of Russian interference in the US presidential election are the subject of FBI and congressional investigations. Links between senior figures close to Mr Trump and Russian officials have been intensely scrutinised in the media, making it difficult for the administration to take measures perceived as offering concessions to Russia. Moreover, Mr Trump's decision to launch a strike on a Syrian airbase in early April has again set Russian and US policy on Syria-an area where Mr Trump's advisers had hoped to build co-operation-on divergent paths. We believe it likely that US and EU sanctions will be retained in the medium term. Russian counter sanctions on Western food imports are also likely to remain in place indefinitely.
Regardless of Mr Trump's stance, Russia's broader foreign policy will remain vehemently opposed to Western integration with the countries of the former Soviet Union. Russia's policy towards its neighbours, and towards Ukraine in particular, will be an enduring source of tension with the West. Regime change in any country in Russia's immediate neighbourhood, particularly via popular uprising, would be likely to trigger a crisis in relations between Russia and the West.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
Economic reform will be subordinated to the imperatives of political stability and regime survival. We do not expect the government to move substantively towards liberalisation of the economy, and certainly not before the presidential election in March 2018, although some reform is possible thereafter.
A more likely scenario is that the government will seek incrementally to improve the efficiency of the system by replacing failing officials and bureau-crats and cracking down selectively on corruption. Following the presidential election the government is likely to extend the pension age and conduct a limited tax reform. Progress on strengthening the rule of law and protecting property rights is likely to be limited. The government will continue to sell minority stakes in some major state-controlled assets. However, as with the sale in December 2016 of a 19.5% stake in Rosneft, a Russian oil giant, the govern-ment's priority is to raise budget revenue rather than increasing the level of competition in the economy or reducing state influence over it.
Russia's stand-off with the West has strengthened statist and protectionist trends within the government. Economic sovereignty-understood as insulating the economy from external shocks-will remain a strategic priority. The main elements of this strategy include a large positive sovereign external asset position (low public debt combined with substantial foreign-exchange reserves), protectionist measures to encourage import substitution and support domestic manufacturing, and a cautious approach to globalisation and foreign investment (which in "strategic sectors", such as the extractive sector, is likely to be permitted only in partnership with state-controlled companies).
Some policymakers have urged a further increase in state intervention in the economy, along with capital controls, expansionist monetary policy and a return to a fixed exchange rate. We believe that the government will continue to pursue a mixed approach, observing the broad tenets of a market economy and avoiding disruptive reforms and excessive market-distorting behaviour (such as exchange or capital controls) while maintaining a large state role in the economy.
We expect the government to remain committed to its import substitution policy, and formal and informal barriers to external trade will remain significant.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
The government faces tight budget constraints as a result of international sanctions, low commodity prices and the reluctance of Western banks to handle international bond issuances (although Russia succeeded in placing two Eurobonds in 2016). The deficit in 2016 was the equivalent of 3.4% of GDP; however, this included extraordinary income from the sale of a stake in Rosneft in December last year. Without this, the deficit would have exceeded 4% of GDP.
Under the government's initial budget for 2017, spending will fall from Rb16.4trn (US$276bn) in 2016 to Rb16.2trn. This is broadly in line with the Ministry of Finance's proposal in July that spending be frozen for the next three years in nominal terms (which was based on the original expenditure target for 2016 of Rb16.1trn). Based on an average oil price of US$40/barrel in 2017, the govern-ment expects revenue to rise by 1.8%.
As anticipated, the government is now planning revisions in the light of higher average oil price. Anton Siluanov, the minister of finance, has suggested that expenditure could rise by Rb200bn (US$3.6bn) compared with the original budget, and that the budget deficit target could be reduced to 2% of GDP, from 3.2% previously. We forecast a significantly higher oil price than set out in the original budget, of US$56/b. We forecast a budget deficit of 2.2% of GDP this year, allowing for slightly higher additional spending than currently proposed by the finance ministry.
We expect the finance ministry to continue to trim the deficit in 2018-21, but the adjustment to expenditure is likely to be less radical than planned, particularly given the forthcoming presidential election. We believe that the government is unlikely to hold expenditure fixed in nominal terms in 2018-19 as planned, although spending will still decline in real terms. We forecast that the deficit will narrow to within 1% of GDP by 2021.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
At its meeting in April the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) cut its policy rate by 50 basis points, to 9.25%. This was the central bank's second cut in as many months, after it had held the rate unchanged since September last year. The strong rouble, driven by higher oil prices and the carry trade, has helped to push disinflation ahead of the CBR's expectations. We expect the CBR to reduce its policy rate to 8-8.5% by the end of the year. We expect further loosening of monetary policy in 2018. With inflation now at the CBR's 4% target, the central bank governor, Elvira Nabiullina, has suggested that an appropriate level for the real interest rate would be about 2.5-3%.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Russia's growth was decelerating even before 2014, as it ran into structural constraints. The economy experienced a sharp recession in 2015 as a result of the fall in the oil price, and real household incomes declined by almost 20%. The Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) now estimates that the economy contracted by 2.8% in 2015 and 0.2% in 2016.
The outlook for 2017 will depend on the path of household consumption. We expect real wage growth to pick up this year, to more than 2%. Following a sharp decline in US dollar incomes in 2015-16, however, household consumption is likely to remain subdued. Retail sales volumes grew by 2.4% quarter on quarter in January-March (seasonally adjusted), but continued to contract in year-on-year terms. Leading indicators for manufacturing fell back in April, but the service sector purchasing managers' index remained strong.
Fiscal consolidation will continue to constrain public consumption and infrastructure spending. We expect a weak recovery in investment, after three years of contraction. Corporate deleveraging will slow and external financing conditions are likely to improve marginally. A relaxation of Western sanctions-not our core forecast-would provide a modest boost to investment. However, perceptions of political risk would remain high, limiting foreign direct investment (FDI) outside the commodities sector. An upswing in regional growth should lead to continued export growth, but at a slower pace than in 2016, as oil production is forecast to be flat. We forecast real GDP growth of 1.6% this year, with risks oriented to the downside, as household consumption might be weaker than currently projected.
The stabilisation of the economy should allow continued growth in investment in 2018, although it will remain relatively weak. A forecast slowdown in China will hit Russia's terms of trade, and we expect Russia's growth rate to moderate slightly, to 1.4%. The public sector will remain a drag on domestic demand.
In the medium term, outdated capital stock, a declining workforce, dependence on natural-resource sectors, institutional weaknesses, low investment and statist policies will limit real GDP growth. We forecast that real GDP growth will average about 1.6% per year in 2018-21, in line with CBR estimates of Russia's trend growth under the current institutional and macroeconomic framework. There currently seems to be little prospect of far-reaching domestic institutional reform. High political risk and the poor business environment will continue to depress investment below the level needed to develop a higher trend growth rate. The declining workforce will also be a constraint on headline growth, although in some sectors this will be offset by continued high immigration from the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
Inflation stood at 5.4% year on year in December 2016, but had slowed to 4.1% by April 2017 and 4% in mid-May, according to the Ministry of Economy, meaning that the CBR has achieved its inflation target more than six months ahead of schedule. Disinflation has been assisted by a strong harvest last year and the appreciation of the rouble. Both factors could prove to be temporary, given that the strong rouble is in part due to the carry trade, which will unwind as the CBR continues to loosen monetary policy. We forecast that consumer price inflation will average 4% in 2017. The slowdown in China will lead to a modest depre-ciation of the rouble in 2018, but external inflationary pressures are likely to be relatively low. Tax changes in 2019 are expected to push up inflation slightly in that year. Overall, we expect inflation to remain close to-but slightly above-target in the medium term.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
Higher oil prices and relatively tight monetary policy, which has boosted the carry trade, has led to a significant appreciation of the rouble against the US dollar. In mid-May the rouble stood at Rb56:US$1. We expect the rouble to depreciate moderately from this level in the second half of 2017 as the CBR gradually loosens monetary policy. The rouble is highly correlated with the oil price, and any rapid fall in the oil price could lead to renewed exchange-rate volatility. We forecast an average full-year rate of just over Rb60:US$1. Our forecast growth slowdown in China in 2018 will hit Russia's terms of trade, and we expect the rouble to depreciate slightly in that year. Oil prices are forecast to be broadly stable around US$60/b in 2018-21, and therefore we do not anticipate significant movements in the rouble-dollar exchange rate.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
We forecast an increased current-account surplus in 2017 as higher oil prices boost the value of exports. This will be tempered by higher imports as domestic demand and investment pick up, alongside increased outflows on the primary and secondary accounts. We expect the current account to remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, but a further recovery in imports and investment will gradually reduce the size as a share of GDP. International sanctions and political uncertainty will depress FDI and portfolio inflows, although we expect these to recover in 2018-21.

Full text:   Country forecast overview: Highlights
Since the failed coup by parts of the military on July 15th 2016 there has been a rapid deterioration in Turkey's political outlook, and it looks set to continue. The president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) are steadily tightening their grip on power. This process is undermining Turkey's already fragile democratic institutions and governance structures, and exacerbating the already deep social and political polarisation of the country. The approval in a referendum on April 16th 2017 of a set of constitutional changes designed to replace Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidency with few checks and balances moves the country one step closer to one-man rule by Mr Erdogan.
The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast is that Mr Erdogan and the AKP will win the next presidential and parliamentary elections, completing the transfer of executive powers to Mr Erdogan. The elections are not due to be held until late 2019, but they could be called earlier-once the institutions and instruments of the new presidential system are in place-if Mr Erdogan decides to accelerate the transfer of executive powers to the presidency. Emergency rule, which was introduced following the failed coup, will continue to be used to silence government critics and disable the pro-Kurdish opposition. Emergency rule will remain in place until at least late July 2017, and probably beyond.
Turkey is vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and jihadi extremists affiliated with Islamic State (IS). Turkey risks be-coming mired in the Syrian conflict, following the deployment of Turkish troops to Syria to combat IS and to halt the territorial expansion by Syrian Kurds.
With the government focused with domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges, we expect little progress on economic reforms to improve the business and investor climate. Fiscal policy will be loosened to try to boost the economy, but we expect it to be relatively tight in the forecast period (2017-21).
Political pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey to cut interest rates to boost the economy has eased, but we expect that it will have to tighten monetary policy further in the coming months in order to lower inflation and prevent a further depreciation of the lira amid expectations of higher US interest rates.
We expect average annual real GDP growth to accelerate slightly, from 3% in 2016 to 3.2% in 2017-18 and a still moderate 3.7% annual average in 2019-21. The current-account deficit has narrowed, but will still be difficult to fund, especially if global liquidity is tightened.

Our business environment score for Turkey deteriorates slightly in the forecast period and the country's global ranking deteriorates by 12 places, reflecting the absence of reforms in recent years. Turkey lags most central and east European countries for foreign direct investment. The main shortcomings are a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Privatisations are likely to be delayed amid the post-coup upheaval in the state institutions. Some companies, notably those with media holdings or ties with the Gulenist movement, remain subject to heavy-handed state intervention.
2019-21: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in a wide range of sectors, although the opening-up of the energy market makes progress.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2019-21: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Capital controls are not considered. There is a boost to trade following the lifting of Russian sanctions. Possible increase in protectionism under the new US administration.
2019-21: Customs union with the EU may be extended, but negotiations are likely to be protracted given the deterioration in Turkish-EU relations. More free-trade agreements may come into force with the EU's trading partners.
Taxes
2017-18: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make some progress. Tax rates are largely unchanged.
2019-21: A broader income tax base as exemptions and exceptions are reduced. Possible tax cuts and increased incentives.
Financing
2017-18: Monetary policy remains cautious amid concern about a possible deterioration in credit quality. The Central Bank of Turkey and commercial banks remain under political pressure to keep interest rates low.
2019-21: The banking system remains stable, despite some weaknesses. Heavy reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2017-18: Labour market remains rigid, with relatively high costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment. A 30% minimum wage rise in 2016 could damage competitiveness. Obstacles to employing foreigners ease.
2019-21: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Progress, albeit slow, continues on investment plans in energy, transport and communications.
2019-21: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. The construction of major airport and urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks may persist.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates. b Actual.
Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then, Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West, becoming a member of the Council of Europe (1949) and NATO (1952), and signing an association agreement with the then European Community (1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened under the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but the coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey has a unicameral parliamentary system of government with parliament elected for a four-year term. To win seats parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Under the AKP, Turkey is moving towards a presidential system of government, which will come into effect by late 2019. Since the failed coup, power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability is Turkey's biggest policy challenge. Fiscal policy has remained prudent, but large external financing needs and changing global liquidity conditions will require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy relatively tight to attract adequate capital inflows. The Kurdish problem, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is one of Turkey's most pressing political issues, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015 and there has been a resurgence in violence. The failed coup highlighted long-standing institutional weaknesses, which, with the AKP's consent until 2013, allowed the secretive Gulenist movement to infiltrate the state. Further politicisation of the judiciary is likely after the coup attempt. Corruption and patronage remain widespread.
Taxation: The basic rate of corporation tax is 20%. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Tax reform to reduce evasion was one of the main elements of previous IMF reform programmes but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2016 goods exports (fob) came to US$150.2bn and imports (fob) to US$191bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$40.8bn-a contraction from US$48.1bn in 2015. The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
Since the failed coup by parts of the military in July 2016 there has been a rapid deterioration in Turkey's political outlook, and this looks set to continue. The president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) are steadily tightening their grip on power. This is undermining Turkey's already fragile democratic institutions and governance structures, and exacer-bating the already deep social and political polarisation of the country. In a referendum on April 16th, a set of constitutional changes designed to replace Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidency were approved. This moves the country one step closer to one-man rule by Mr Erdogan. The president will not be deterred by the narrow margin of victory in the referendum, allegations of vote fraud or bids to nullify the referendum. The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast is that Mr Erdogan and the AKP will win the next presidential and parliamentary elections, completing the transfer of executive powers to Mr Erdogan with few checks and balances. These elections are not due to be held until 2019, but they could be called earlier, once the institutions and instruments of the new presidential system are in place, if Mr Erdogan decides to accelerate the transfer of executive powers to the presidency.
Given the close referendum result and the allegations of vote fraud we expect political instability to persist in Turkey, which is likely to delay further economic reform efforts, hamper economic recovery and damage the country's already fragile relations with the EU. Immediately after the referendum the government announced the extension for another three months, to late July 2017, of the state of emergency law that was introduced in response to the failed coup. Emergency rule allows the president and the cabinet to pass laws without the approval of parliament and without recourse to the Constitutional Court, effectively allowing Mr Erdogan to govern as a president with executive powers until the new system of government is in place. Emergency rule was initially introduced to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric, who is accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. However, the use of these powers has been extended to eliminate the pro-Kurdish political opposition, which the government accuses of having links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). More than 100,000 people, mainly in the judiciary, the military, the police, academic institutions and the media, have so far been suspended, dismissed or detained.
Security risk will remain high, with negative implications for the economy. The state is seeking to end an insurgency by the PKK in the south-east of Turkey, address the domestic security risk posed by terrorist attacks by Kurdish militants and Islamic State (IS) in cities across the country, and implement military operations in Syria and Iraq against both IS and the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds. The purge of the Turkish armed forces and the police since the attempted coup has created operational capacity problems and contributed to intelligence failures that have exacerbated Turkey's domestic security issues. In the short to medium term neither the government nor the PKK appears to be interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will intensify.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
The next parliamentary and presidential elections are due to be held in November 2019 at the latest. We expect Mr Erdogan to win the presidential election and to remain in office, with enhanced powers, for at least one more five-year term, if not two (the maximum allowed), up to 2029. His popularity is unrivalled, and the opposition is fragmented and lacks candidates capable of challenging him. In 2014 Mr Erdogan won the presidential election in the first round with just over 50% of the vote, well ahead of a joint candidate presented by the two main opposition parties, the Republican People's Party (CHP) and the Nationalist Action Party (MHP). The MHP's support in parliament for the AKP's presidential reform makes it unlikely that either of the two parties would consider fielding a joint candidate at the next election.
The clampdown on the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) since mid-2015, the MHP leadership's decision to back the presidential reform, and the hardline nationalist stance adopted by Mr Erdogan and the AKP could have a considerable effect on voting patterns at the next parliamentary election. Both the MHP and the HDP have been weakened since the 2015 elections and run the risk of falling below the high 10% national vote threshold for representation in parliament, which would help to boost the AKP's share of seats. Under the constitutional changes approved in the presidential reform referendum, there will be 600 seats in a much weakened parliament from the next election, up from 550 currently.
The next local elections are scheduled to take place by March 2019.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Since the failed coup Turkish foreign policy has been heavily conditioned by Mr Erdogan's domestic political goals, notably his push to establish a presidential system of government. This approach, combined with ongoing political upheaval in Europe and the US, has resulted in a marked deterioration in Turkey's international relations with its traditional Western allies.
Tensions with the EU escalated to new highs during the presidential reform referendum campaign and are unlikely to ease in the near future, given Mr Erdogan's narrow win and allegations of vote fraud. Neither Turkey nor the EU is genuinely interested in Turkish membership of the bloc any more, but neither has yet been willing to suspend negotiations unilaterally. If Turkey reintroduces the death penalty, as Mr Erdogan has suggested since the failed coup, the EU may not be able to avoid suspending the process. Our baseline forecast has been that the death penalty is unlikely to be reinstated, but this cannot be ruled out given the government's increasingly hardline nationalist stance. The suspension of accession negotiations would almost certainly prompt Tukey to end its collaboration with the EU to stem the movement of migrants and refugees into Europe. An agreement on a solution to end the de facto division of Cyprus between the Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north could help to improve Turkey's relations with the EU, but we believe that a settlement is unlikely during the forecast period (2017-21).
The Trump administration is less concerned about Mr Erdogan's autocratic tendencies than its Democrat predecessor, but is equally unresponsive to Turkey's domestic and regional security concerns. Vague US reassurances about support for Turkey's fight against terrorism avoided a full-blown crisis in May 2017, when as expected Mr Trump authorised the supply of arms to the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) for the offensive against IS in its stronghold in Raqqa in Syria. This ignored Turkey's objection that, in its view, the YPG is affiliated with the outlawed PKK in Turkey. As yet there has also been no response to Turkey's request for Mr Gulen to be extradited from the US to face trial in Turkey on charges of masterminding the failed coup.
Since mid-2016 Turkey has improved its ties with Russia, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly in relation to the conflict in Syria, where both countries are militarily involved but are pursuing contrasting goals. We expect relations to remain largely transactional and the risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
We expect political instability and fluctuations in global liquidity as a result of anticipated shifts in US monetary policy to pose an ongoing risk to foreign capital inflows to Turkey, especially in the first half of the forecast period. These inflows are needed to meet the country's large external financing requirements, but tend to be short-term and highly volatile. Faltering capital inflows put the lira under intense pressure in late 2016-early 2017, fuelling an acceleration in inflation that prompted the Central Bank of Turkey to start tightening monetary policy after a prolonged period of loosening. An abrupt tightening of policy could strangle Turkey's already fragile economic growth.
Turkey's economy has shown considerable resilience during past bouts of volatility in global liquidity, owing largely to the country's solid public finances and well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector. However, uncertainty about the direction of economic policy in recent years has clouded Turkey's medium-term economic policy outlook. Although the AKP government has focused on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges, the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate have been blocked. The biggest policy challenge in the short term will be to support the recovery of Turkey's flagging economy while also controlling inflationary pressures and stabilising the lira. The current direction of policy appears to be towards a difficult balancing act between fiscal loosening and tight monetary policy while encouraging banks to lend to households and businesses.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios-reflecting the impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past but also major upward revisions to Turkey's national accounts-give the AKP government some leeway to loosen fiscal policy to support the economy. Our baseline forecast remains that fiscal policy will be kept relatively tight, but that the central government deficit will widen, from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to an average of 2.1% of GDP per year in 2017-21. The government debt/GDP ratio is low, but it edged up slightly, to 29.4% in 2016, from 29.1% in 2015. We expect a further moderate increase in 2017-19, before it declines to about 30% in 2021. However, the risk of a larger deterioration in the public finances cannot be ruled out. The government's decision to transfer Turkey's major state assets to a sovereign wealth fund set up in 2016 to help to finance major infrastructure projects could bring to a halt the government's privatisation programme and increase political control over state companies, and the fund could become a vehicle for increased off-budget spending.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
Political pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey to lower interest rates to revive economic activity has eased in recent months, but we expect that it will have to tighten monetary policy further in the coming months in order to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent a further depreciation of the lira amid expectations of higher US interest rates. We expect the bank to use a mix of interest-rate rises, macroprudential measures and other policies. The central bank has raised most of its main policy rates since November 2016 and has increasingly provided funding to the banking sector at its previously little used "late liquidity window" overnight lending rate, which has gradually been raised by a total of 250 basis points, to 12.25% in late-April. Since November 2016 the weighted average cost of the central bank's funds to the banking system has risen from 7.8% to about 11.9% in mid-May 2017.
The central bank is seeking gradually to normalise its monetary policy frame-work to establish a single policy interest rate, the one-week repurchase lending rate, which would help to improve transparency regarding monetary policy decisions. However, it is unlikely that the corridor will be eliminated until inflation is more firmly on a downward path towards its medium-term target of 5% and domestic political uncertainty eases. From 2017 the bank will hold only eight regular Monetary Policy Committee meetings annually rather than 12.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Domestic political instability, perceived security risks from terrorist attacks and uncertainty about the global economic outlook will have negative effects on the economy in the short and medium term. We expect real GDP growth to pick up only modestly, from 3% in 2016 to 3.2% per year in 2017-18. In 2019-21 we expect real GDP growth to average 3.7% per year, assuming that there is a stabilisation of domestic conditions. By far the biggest risk to our growth forecast is the possibility of a severe disruption to capital inflows to Turkey.
We expect moderate private consumption growth in 2017-21 as domestic political uncertainty, a weaker lira and high unemployment will partially offset the impact of the 30% minimum wage rise in 2016, government pressure on banks to ease lending conditions for households and government incentives to support demand for certain household durable goods.
After expanding by 7.7% in 2016, we expect government spending to increase by just under 8% per year on average in 2017-19 as the government seeks to revive the economy and boost support ahead of the 2019 elections. From 2020 we expect growth to be more moderate but still solid.
The deterioration in the business environment since the attempted coup will continue to dampen fixed investment growth in 2017-18, as weakened business sentiment and a more cautious approach by foreign investors will offset government plans to invest heavily in infrastructure projects. In 2019-21 we forecast an acceleration to average annual growth of 4.9%, assuming a less volatile domestic and global environment.
After contracting by 1.9% in 2016 as a result of the impact of Russian sanctions and domestic security concerns, especially on the tourism sector, we expect exports of goods and services gradually to return to growth, reflecting the lifting of sanctions and the impact of a weaker lira on export competitiveness. However, we expect the perception of security risks to persist for some time, which will continue to deter visitors to Turkey. Our expectation is that a sharp slowdown in the Chinese economy in 2018 and a cyclical downturn in the US in 2019 will dampen external demand growth in those years.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
Consumer price inflation has remained stubbornly high-well above the official 5% medium-term target-as a weaker lira has, for the most part, offset the disinflationary effects of plunging global oil prices since mid-2014. We expect further currency weakness and a partial recovery in oil and other commodity prices from 2017 to keep consumer price inflation well above the official target during the first half of the forecast period. Assuming that the central bank keeps monetary policy tight and does not loosen it too soon, we see inflation gradually easing, achieving the 5% target by end-2021.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
The Turkish lira has been highly volatile, plunging in value against all major currencies in late 2016-early 2017 and then recovering partially in recent months. Amid further bouts of volatility we expect the lira to depreciate against the US dollar to an annual average of TL3.67:US$1 in 2017, a fall of 18%. In 2018-21 we forecast that the exchange rate will remain broadly stable in real terms, depreciating in nominal terms to an average of TL3.97:US$1 in 2021. The lira will also depreciate sharply against the euro in 2017-21. There are substantial risks to our exchange-rate forecast, arising from uncertainty about the outlook for global financial flows, and the impact on investor confidence of domestic political instability and geopolitical turmoil in the region surrounding Turkey.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
GDP revisions, moderate domestic demand growth, sharply lower global oil prices and a weaker lira have helped to reduce Turkey's current-account deficit in recent years. However, we expect it to widen moderately and remain sufficiently large-at a forecast average of 4.2% of GDP per year in 2017-21-to make it difficult for Turkey to meet its external financing needs if global liquidity is constrained and the loss of investor confidence since the failed coup persists. Although a weaker lira will boost Turkey's main export sectors, we expect this to be largely offset by the higher cost of imported energy and inputs for manufactured import-intensive exports. In addition, the tourism sector is likely to take several years to recover to 2015 pre-crisis levels, before the resurgence of terrorist attacks and the imposition of Russian sanctions.

Full text:   Italy--highlights: Political outlook
The resounding rejection of the flagship constitutional reform package of the government led by Matteo Renzi in a referendum on December 4th 2016 has increased political instability, which will hinder prospects for political and economic reform in Italy. The government formed in December 2016 by Paolo Gentiloni, previously the minister of foreign affairs under Mr Renzi and also a member of the Partito Democratico (PD), is weak and especially vulnerable to political manoeuvrings within the PD and the wider coalition ahead of the next parliamentary election. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that the election will be held at or close to term in early 2018 and that the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) to emerge as the largest party but will not obtain a majority of parliamentary seats. Given the considerable obstacles to M5S form-ing a coalition with other parties, we expect a broad coalition of established centre-left/centre right parties to be formed, but it will be unstable and ineffective. Frustration with such a government would probably fuel further anti-establishment resentment, boosting M5S's chances of entering government after the subsequent election.

Having increased at an annual average rate of 0.4% in 2000-09, total population growth slowed in 2010-16, coming to a halt at 59.8m. We expect population to continue to stagnate during the forecast period, falling slightly to 59.7m in 2021, reflecting lower immigrant inflows and emigration of young Italians.

Italy's business environment score improves slightly during the forecast period (2017-21), but falls by two places in the global rankings, reflecting the slow pace of reform and weak implementation. Its regional ranking is unchanged, at 16th out of 18 west European countries, ahead of only Greece and Turkey. Italy's macro-economic environment score remains unchanged. However, owing to improve-ments in other countries, Italy slips 11 places in our global ranking and by three places in the regional ranking. The scores for policy towards foreign investment, financing and the labour market all improve, reflecting the impact of economic reforms taken by successive governments since late 2011. Italy's tax system remains one of the biggest hindrances to businesses and foreign invest-ment. Compliance is costly and tax evasion remains widespread.

The biggest challenge facing the government will be to balance measures to cut the public debt burden of close to 132.5% of GDP in 2016 with measures designed to promote economic growth, reverse a rise in unemployment and ease social tensions. Repairing the weaknesses in Italy's banking system is also likely to prove challenging. We expect the budget deficit to remain within the 3% of GDP limit for EU countries, but the debt/GDP ratio will remain high and economic reforms to boost growth will only have a gradual effect. After a prolonged recession, Italy's economy has returned to growth, but the recovery remains fragile and the pace of expansion is modest. Driven mainly by domestic demand growth, we expect real GDP to expand at an annual average rate of about 1% in 2017-21. We expect the current account to remain in surplus over the forecast period, although it will decline as domestic demand growth stabilises.

Italy is one of the largest and richest markets in Europe, with a population of about 6om. However, growth potential remains limited because the country is a mature consumer market with weak income and population growth pros-pects. Income levels differ greatly between the north and the south of Italy, with GDP per head in the south less than 55% of that in the centre and north. Past policies have done little to close the gap, so no significant change is expected during the forecast period. Demographic trends will have an important impact on spending patterns, with population ageing driving healthcare expenditure.

Our baseline forecast is that Italy's weak demographic profile will act as a substantial brake on real GDP growth, which we expect to average just 0.5% per year in 2017-50, which is considerably weaker than what was until recently considered to be Italy's trend rate of growth (1.5%). A more favourable political environment could produce a better economic growth performance in the long term, but the chance of improvements in Italy's institutional framework being implemented in the short to medium term is limited.

Background: Post-war Italy has been characterised by a weak political structure and, since the 1970s, a declining economic base. Between 1996 and 2011 Italy had a bipolar political system, dominated by a centre-right alliance and a centre-left coalition. Since 2011 the political landscape has become more fragmented, with the break-up of the centre right and the emergence of Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S), an anti-establishment movement. Since the 2013 general election Italy has had two broad centre-left/centre-right governments. The resignation of Matteo Renzi as prime minister after his flagship constitutional reform was rejected in a referendum on December 4th 2016 triggered a crisis and the formation of another government led by Paolo Gentiloni, a close ally of Mr Renzi.
Political structure: Parliament, which comprises two houses with equal powers, is elected for a maximum of five years. The president, who is elected by parliament for a seven-year term, decides, in the event of a political crisis, whether to call an election or nominate a prime minister to try to form a government. The president also promulgates laws and may return a law to parliament for reconsideration, but has no power of veto. Executive power lies with the cabinet, which is nominated by the prime minister and approved by parliament. The prime minister cannot dismiss ministers without forming a new government. The legislative system remains unchanged following the rejection in the December referendum of a reform to reduce the powers of the Senate (the upper house).
Policy issues: The main issues are the management of, and attempts to reduce, Italy's large public debt (which reached an estimated 132.5% of GDP in 2016), safeguarding the banking system and keeping Italy in the euro zone. In 2012 the government, led by Mario Monti, carried out a number of structural economic reforms to improve competitiveness. The process stalled in 2013, but it was revived under the Renzi government.
Taxation: The top rate of personal income tax is 43% and social security contributions are high, especially for employers. The corporation tax rate is 24%, reduced from 27.5% in 2017, but additional regional and municipal taxes are levied, including the regional business tax (IRAP) to fund health services. The basic rate of IRAP is 3.5%, reduced from 3.9% in 2014. Income earned from most types of financial investment is taxed at 26%. The standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 22%.
Foreign trade: The value of exports of goods (fob) stood at US$449.3bn in 2015, and imports (fob) were worth US$391.4bn. In the same year the current account recorded a surplus of US$29.3bn, or 1.6% of GDP.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
Matteo Renzi, the leader of the Partito Democratico (PD), resigned as prime minister in December 2016 after his flagship constitutional reform package was resoundingly rejected in a referendum. He was replaced by Paolo Gentiloni, previously the minister of foreign affairs under Mr Renzi and also a member of the PD. Mr Gentiloni's government is backed in parliament by the PD, the centre-right Nuovo Centro Destra (NCD)-a splinter party formed when the Popolo della Libertà (PDL) leader, Silvio Berlusconi, withdrew his party from the Letta government coalition and renamed it Forza Italia (FI)-and by two small centrist parties. The main opposition parties are the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S), FI, Lega Nord and Fratelli d'Italia. In addition, the defection from the PD of groups of critics of Mr Renzi's leadership style has added to an array of small parties and movements to the left of the PD, including Sinistra Italiana (SI), combining leftist PD defectors and the left-wing, environmentalist Sinistra Ecologia Libertà (SEL), and Articolo 1-Movimento Democratico e Progressista (MDP), another group of PD defectors.

a Share of national vote for the Chamber of Deputies. b May 25th 2014. c In November 2013 the PDL split into Forza Italia (FI) and Nuovo Centro Destra (NCD). FI went into opposition and the NCD remained in the PD-led coalition government. d Since the February 2013 election the group has split into two groups in parliament, Scelta Civica per l'Italia and Per l'Italia.
Political outlook: Political stability
The coalition government, led by Paolo Gentiloni of the dominant centre-left PD, was formed in December 2016 following Mr Renzi's resignation. The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast is that the Gentiloni government will remain in place until the end of the current parliamentary term, in early 2018. However, another government crisis and a snap general election in the final months of this year cannot be ruled out. The government is weak and especially vulnerable to political manoeuvrings within the PD and the wider coalition ahead of the next election.
Having also resigned as secretary of the PD in February 2017 to confront his critics in the party, Mr Renzi was re-elected with about 69% of the vote in a leadership contest that concluded with a public vote on April 30th. The margin of victory has helped to tighten Mr Renzi's grip on a divided party, which ahead of the leadership contest saw a large group of leftists break away under the MDP banner. Nevertheless, Mr Renzi faces a huge challenge to rebuild popular support and credibility after the failure of the constitutional reform referendum and to fend off the growing challenge of M5S, a Eurosceptic, anti-establishment movement led by Beppe Grillo. To do this Mr Renzi may adopt a tougher line with the Gentiloni government and the EU, which has pressured Italy to take additional corrective measures to meet agreed budget targets.
Against this backdrop, Mr Gentiloni has a difficult policy remit, including trying to keep the economic recovery on track while controlling the public finances, managing problems in Italy's banking sector, dealing with a renewed influx of migrants and tackling the aftermath of a series of deadly earthquakes, as well as the imminent collapse of the former national carrier, Alitalia. At the same time the government will have little say over the main issue driving the political debate, namely the need to align the electoral laws of the two houses of parliament after elements of both were declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court in separate rulings for the Senate (the upper house) in 2013 and the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) in January 2017. The task of reforming the electoral laws will fall to the leaders of the main parties in parliament-Mr Renzi for the PD, Angelino Alfano for NCD, Mr Grillo for M5S and Silvio Berlusconi for the centre-right FI. Their views differ significantly on the issue. Failure to reach an agreement could destabilise the government and trigger an early election to be held under the electoral laws as they stand, which are essentially strongly proportional for both houses. A majoritarian element (bonus seats) left intact in the Chamber of Deputies would only be triggered if a party exceeded 40% of the vote, but based on current opinion polls no party is likely to reach this threshold. Assuming, as we do, that the next election will be held under strongly proportional electoral laws, we expect the next government to be unstable and ineffective, unable to pass long overdue political and economic reforms.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
Italy is governed by weak, divided executives, generally comprising multiparty coalitions, in which small parties wield disproportionate power over policy decisions. Under the bicameral parliamentary system all bills have to be passed in the same form by both houses of parliament in order to be enacted, often resulting in delays and the dilution of measures. This is unlikely to change following the rejection of the Renzi government's constitutional reform package, which sought drastically to reduce the legislative powers of the Senate and would have effectively made the parliament quasi-unicameral.
Efficiency may improve in the public administration, but not in the judiciary
Red tape and Italy's inefficient judicial system are likely to continue to pose problems for businesses. However, measures being introduced to increase public-sector accountability and efficiency should help to speed up gradually some bureaucratic procedures, although given entrenched resistance to change within the public administration, the implementation of the reforms approved in 2015 is likely to be slow. A partial reform of the judicial system was under-taken in 2014-16. However, many of the problems facing Italy's judicial system have not been addressed, including a fee system for lawyers that acts as a disin-centive to concluding cases swiftly, a lack of specialisation among judges and a highly fragmented court system. The average number of days to resolve a contractual dispute in Italy is more than double that in some other EU member states.
Corruption is still rife in business, judging by the number of corruption scandals revealed in recent years. A bill presented in March 2010 containing measures intended to combat corruption among public officials took almost three years to become law. Since then, government action appears to have intensified. In June 2014 the powers of the anti-corruption authority were strengthened, and less than a year later parliament approved another anti-corruption law, including provisions eliminating the minimum threshold for the prosecution of accounting fraud and introducing harsher prison sentences for this offense, as well as corruption of public officials, embezzlement and mafia association.
Criminal organisations will continue to pose problems for businesses and deter investment, despite the authorities' efforts to combat extortion and usury and the arrests of several mafia bosses in recent years.
Political outlook: Election watch
The December 2016 referendum outcome and the subsequent increase in political instability have considerable implications for our forecasts for the next parliamentary election, which we expect to take place in early 2018. We expect that the political parties will harmonise the two electoral laws, instituting a strongly proportional electoral system for both houses of parliament. In the less likely scenario that the laws are left unchanged, we would expect no single party to reach the 40% threshold for bonus seats in the lower house. As a result, we expect that the next election will produce consistent results in the two houses, but also that the fragmentation of the political system into three main blocs-centre left, M5S and centre right-will prevent any bloc from emerging as the clear winner.
The main contest is likely to be between the PD and M5S. Support for the two parties remains broadly similar, at about 30% of the vote, according to opinion polls. Although M5S's credibility has been dented by recent political blunders and local-level scandals, most notably in Rome's city government, we expect it to emerge as the largest party at the next election, boosted by Mr Renzi's defeat in the referendum, the split in the PD and an increase in anti-politics sentiment. However, under a strongly proportional voting system, we expect that M5S will not obtain a majority of parliamentary seats. This would require it to enter a coalition with other parties to form a government. Given M5S's hardline stance towards the established parties across the political spectrum and these parties' concerns about M5S's policies and administrative capability, we believe that M5S would be unlikely to succeed. It is more likely that the established parties will be persuaded to join forces to keep M5S out of government, leading to the establishment between the centre left and the centre right of an unstable coalition. Frustration with such a government would probably fuel further anti-establishment resentment, boosting M5S's chances of winning the subsequent election and possibly entering government.
The president is elected for a seven-year term by an electoral college of the Senate, the Chamber of Deputies and regional representatives. The next presi-dential election is not due until 2022. The next local elections in several large towns and cities, notably Genoa and Palermo, will take place in June 2017.
Political outlook: Key players to watch
Matteo Renzi
A former mayor of Florence, Mr Renzi first became leader of the Partito Democratico (PD) in December 2013 with almost 68% of the 2.8m votes cast in the primary elections. After resigning as prime minister in December 2016 he also stepped down as PD leader to confront his critics in a leadership contest, which he won convincingly again with 69.2% of the vote on April 30th 2017. Turnout was lower than in 2013, however, at about 1.8m. As leader of the PD, Mr Renzi has shifted the party to the right, loosening the PD's ties with its traditional trade union supporter base and antagonising the party's large leftist minority. Mr Renzi's popular appeal declined steadily after the PD won an unprecedented 40% of the vote in the May 2014 European Parliament elections. This helped to galvanise opponents of his reform plans within his party and on the opposition benches, culminating in the resounding rejection of his flagship constitutional reform package in a referendum in December 2016. As prime minister from February 2014-December 2016 Mr Renzi's performance was mixed. He succeeded in introducing some economic reforms that had eluded Italian governments over the previous 20 years, but his abrasive and at times autocratic leadership style became increasingly polarising. Having won a fresh mandate to lead the PD, his goal is to be elected to parliament for the first time at the next general election, due to be held in early 2018, and become prime minister again. Mr Renzi's bid to return to the prime minister's office will be more difficult than his ascent in 2014, when he effectively ousted Enrico Letta, also of the PD, from the post. He needs to rebuild his popular support after the referendum defeat and counter the rise of the anti-establishment, Eurosceptic Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S).
Sergio Mattarella
Mr Mattarella, a former Constitutional Court judge and government minister, was elected president by the parliament and electoral college in January 2015 following the retirement of his predecessor, Giorgio Napolitano. Although Mr Napolitano gave explicit support to Mr Renzi and his reform agenda in his last year in office, Mr Mattarella has been more circumspect. Since the Constitutional Court ruling in January 2017 declaring aspects of the electoral law for the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of parliament) unconstitutional, Mr Mattarella has used his non-partisan position to pressure the political parties to agree on changes to the electoral laws before the next election. He will play a vital role in the government formation process after the next election. It is the president's prerogative to decide whether and when to call a parliamentary election. He also designates the prime minister, after consultation with the parties in parliament and former presidents.
Beppe Grillo
Mr Grillo founded M5S, a protest movement, in 2009. At its first general election in 2013 M5S shocked the political establishment by obtaining about 25% of the vote. Amid internal wrangling, M5S lost ground in the May 2014 European Parliament elections, but it was still the second-largest party by vote share, with just over 20%. In opinion polls support for M5S has recovered to close to 30% of the vote, on a par with the PD. In 2016 Mr Grillo adopted a lower profile, which allowed Luigi Di Maio, the deputy speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, to emerge as the party's leader in parliament and potentially its prime ministerial candidate at the next general election. However, following a series of party blunders and local-level scandals, notably in Rome, he has reasserted his control. Although he will not stand in the general election he is likely to dominate the M5S's electoral campaign. TheM5S's Eurosceptic, anti-establishment rhetoric resonates strongly with voters disillusioned with the mainstream parties on both the centre left and centre right, virtually all of which have been embroiled in corruption scandals at national or local level.
Silvio Berlusconi
Mr Berlusconi's personal wealth, dominance of the media and tendency to confuse the public good and his own interests made him a controversial prime minister during the 20 years that he dominated Italian politics. He is a much diminished political figure since his expulsion from parliament in 2013 as a consequence of his definitive conviction for tax fraud. However, Mr Berlusconi is still the leader of the main centre-right party in parliament, Forza Italia, and he is seeking to determine who will emerge as his successor as the leader of a broader centre-right alliance to challenge Mr Renzi and the PD. In a highly fragmented parliament his position on planned changes to the electoral laws could be decisive, as could be his stance in the process of government formation after the next general election.
Matteo Salvini
Under Mr Salvini's leadership since December 2013, the Lega Nord has enjoyed a rise in popular support in opinion polls. However, with the general election approaching in early 2018, support for the Lega Nord appears to have plateaued at 13-14%, putting it on a par with the once dominant Forza Italia. Following the presidential election defeat of the Front national leader, Marine Le Pen, in France in May 2017, the Lega Nord's old guard and founders, whom Mr Salvini has sought to sideline, have revived their criticism of his leadership, which has transformed the party from what was originally a regionalist protest movement from the north into a populist party of national appeal with a strong anti-immigrant, Eurosceptic message. From 1994 until late 2011 Lega Nord propped up several centre-right governments led by Mr Berlusconi, gradually abandoning its original goal of secession of the north from the rest of Italy. By 2011 the party and its leadership had become mired in allegations of abuse of party funds.
Political outlook: International relations
We expect the mainstays of Italy's foreign relations to remain in place during the forecast period (2017-21): membership of the EU and the euro zone, a close relationship with the US and membership of NATO and the UN. We expect the government led by Mr Gentiloni to maintain broadly positive EU relations, as would a broad coalition government if, as we expect, one were to be formed after the next general election. Nevertheless, the rise of anti-establishment parties in Italy and elsewhere in Europe has led voters to question Italy's hitherto strong commitment to European integration. M5S has proposed a referendum on Italy's membership of the euro area and recently flirted with the idea of a NATO referendum as well. Although referendums on international treaties are not permitted by the Italian constitution, there would be a risk of at least a non-binding vote on the euro if an M5S-led government were to come to power, although this is not our baseline forecast. Such action could unnerve financial markets and Italy's European partners if it were to go ahead. Regardless of who is in government, Italy's high public debt burden and political instability will continue to be a cause for concern for some time for the core euro zone creditor countries, as well as a risk to the survival of the bloc and to the stability of its financial sector.
The Italian government has supported the sanctions that the EU has imposed on Russia since July 2014 as a result of Russia's intervention in Ukraine. We expect them to remain in place during most of the forecast period.
We expect Italy to maintain its commitment to the US-led campaign against Islamic State (IS) in Iraq and Syria, although without participating in air strikes. Italy and the US have worked closely together to support the Government of National Accord (GNA) in Libya, but the future direction of US policy is uncertain following the change of administration in the US.

Population growth is projected to come to a virtual halt
Having declined for several years in the late 1990s, Italy's total population increased moderately in 2000-09, rising by an average of 0.4% per year. Since 2010 population growth has slowed gradually, coming to a halt at 59.8m in 2016. The increase was mainly driven by immigration and births to foreign residents. More recently, the stagnation reflects the failure of births to keep pace with deaths, as well as lower net immigration, as the expectation of scarce job oppor-tunities due to the weakness of the economy has probably reduced the influx of immigrants and driven further emigration of young Italians. There is some uncertainty about future levels of immigration to Italy from outside Europe. Since the EU's March 2016 agreement with Turkey, the flow of migrants from Turkey to Greece and on to northern Europe has more or less ceased, but it has coincided with a sharp increase in migrant flows to Italy. In the past most migrants arriving in Italy moved on to other EU countries, notably Germany. However, this has become more difficult, as other EU member states have tightened their border controls with Italy.
According to Istat (the national statistics office), the proportion of foreign residents in the total population has increased steadily in recent years, rising from 4.5% in 2005 to 8% at end-2013 and 8.3% at end-2016, unchanged from the previous year. The majority of immigrants live in the north and the centre of Italy, where foreign residents accounted for 10.7% of the population at end-2015 (latest available data), up from about 10% in 2013. However, growth in the number of foreign nationals residing in the south has begun to outpace that in the north and centre in recent years. The three largest national groups are Romanians, Albanians and Moroccans, who together account for about 40% of the total number of foreign residents. Even during periods of modest economic growth, shortages of skilled and even unskilled workers are likely to re-emerge in areas of high employment such as the north-east, owing to deficiencies in the labour market. This is likely to result in employers calling for immigrant worker quotas to be raised.
Although almost 70% of Italians live in urban areas, the population is widely dispersed among numerous small cities and towns. As a result, local markets tend to be diffused and relatively small scale. The combined population of Italy's three largest cities-Rome (the capital), Milan and Naples-accounts for less than 10% of the country's total population, although if the outer suburbs are included, the three main urban areas account for about 20% of the total population.
Reforms seek to increase labour mobility
The steady rise in the employment rate (the percentage of people aged 20-64 in employment) since the mid-1990s came to a halt in 2008. At 61.6% in 2016, down from 62.9% in 2008, according to Eurostat, it was about 10 percentage points lower than the EU28 average and the third-lowest rate in the EU, ahead of only Greece and Croatia, and slightly below Spain. The reasons for this include cultural factors, but also the low effective retirement age and limited mobility from areas of high unemployment in the south to those of high employment in the north. Low labour mobility has been perpetuated to a large extent by the greater use of temporary employment contracts, especially for young workers, poor active labour market policies and an inadequate system of unemployment benefits. The labour market reforms approved since 2012 aim to gradually address some of these issues during the forecast period. In spite of the projected decline in the working-age population during the forecast period, the labour force will increase moderately. This will be attributable to greater female participation as well as pension reforms, which have reduced the incentive for early retirement, and measures to improve jobseeking services.
Rise in proportion of elderly will put pressure on pensions and healthcare
During the forecast period the number of people of working age will be considerably lower than the number of people reaching 65. As a result, Italy's old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of people aged over 65 to those of working age) will rise further. At an estimated 33% in 2016, it is already one of the highest in the EU. By the end of the forecast period it is expected to reach 35%, compared with 37% in Germany, 34% in France and 29% in the UK.
This trend, combined with the continued rise in life expectancy, will continue to put upward pressure on public expenditure on pensions and care for the elderly. Italy's public pension spending has been on a steadily rising trend and is among the highest in the EU as a share of GDP. According to figures from the Ministry of the Economy, public pension spending is projected to decline gradually over the next ten years, from a peak of about 16% in 2013-14, owing to a series of reforms introduced since the beginning of the 1990s.

a See Guide to the business rankings model at the end of this report. b Out of 10. c Out of 82 countries. d Out of 18 countries: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK.
Although Italy's business environment score has improved slightly during the forecast period (2017-21), it has fallen by two places in the global rankings compared with the historical period (2011-16), reflecting the slow pace of reform and weak implementation. Its regional ranking is unchanged, at 16th out of 18 west European countries, ahead of only Greece and Turkey.
Institutional reform to improve government effectiveness is unlikely
Italy scores poorly for government effectiveness because of its slow legislative and judicial systems. Following the rejection of Matteo Renzi's constitutional reforms, institutional reform will be off the political agenda for the foreseeable future. The parliamentary election, due to be held in early 2018, is likely to produce another unstable coalition government. A partial reform of the judicial system in 2014-16 is unlikely to be sufficient to resolve the problems facing Italy's judicial system. The economic recovery remains on track, but is modest. Promoting economic growth and employment, as well as reducing Italy's elevated public debt burden and repairing weaknesses in the banking sector, will remain the biggest policy challenge facing the government in 2017-21.
The scores for policy towards foreign investment, financing and the labour market all improve, reflecting the impact of economic reforms taken by successive governments since late 2011. Recent governments have also taken steps to reduce political opposition to foreign takeovers, and public receptiveness to overseas investment has also improved.
Despite moderate cuts to income and business levies since 2014, Italy's tax system remains one of the biggest hindrances to businesses and foreign investment. Compliance is costly and tax evasion remains widespread. The government has taken some steps to encourage mergers in the banking sector and support banks' efforts to reduce the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) on their balance sheets, but progress has been slow.
Business environment outlook: Italy's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Significant reforms to improve competition are unlikely ahead of the 2018 election.
2019-21: Further improvements in competition policy are dependent on political stability.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Recent administrative reform has brought about modest reductions in red tape. Some streamlining of the judicial system is likely, but lengthy delays persist.
2019-21: Organised crime, legal complexity and shortcomings in the judicial system remain deterrents, with further reform progress dependent on political stability.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Quotas and tariffs are in line with EU practice. EU-UK trade deal to dominate Brexit negotiations. The risk of euro area break-up, which could lead to capital controls, is moderate, although we expect Greece to have left the bloc by 2021.
2019-21: Trade barriers remain low, but agricultural protection continues. The EU focuses on further bilateral free-trade deals. However, EU-US agreement will probably remain elusive.
Taxes
2017-18: Despite a tax cut for businesses, levies remain elevated to curb the budget deficit.
2019-21: Overall tax rates stay high, but the burden of future fiscal tightening is likely to fall on public expenditure.
Financing
2017-18: Despite new legislation, bank mergers, further recapitalisation and non-performing loan sales are slow. Overall profitability and credit provision are still weak.
2019-21: Banking sector exposure to the Italian sovereign will persist. Mergers of smaller co-operative banks and possible foreign takeovers should accelerate, as will the gradual sale of securitised bad loans.
The labour market
2017-18: Despite reforms, Italy's weak economic recovery will see firms remain reluctant to increase open-ended contract payrolls. Universal unemployment benefit is gradually introduced.
2019-21: Decentralisation of productivity-related pay deals is likely to be slow. Pressure to improve competitiveness leads to more flexible work organisation at company level. Changes to public employment contracts are likely to be resisted.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Infrastructure continues to exhibit deficiencies. Lack of political appetite for drastic current-expenditure cuts limits room for public investment.
2019-21: Infrastructure still lags that of other euro area countries, despite some new investment.

The Economist Intelligence Unit's assessment of the macroeconomic environment focuses not on headline real GDP growth (measured in the market opportunities category) but on economic stability and the underlying policy framework, which influence business planning, hiring and investment. Italy's macroeconomic environment score is unchanged in the forecast period. However, owing to improvements in other countries, Italy slips 11 places in our global ranking, and by three places in the regional ranking. Despite some progress, economic reforms were introduced with a lag relative to most other struggling euro zone economies, and further measures to reverse more than a decade of stagnant productivity growth are unlikely in the current political environment. We expect Italy to keep its budget deficit within the EU's 3% of GDP limit and to continue to generate primary surpluses (the budget balance excluding interest payments), but the public debt burden will remain about 130% of GDP during the forecast period.
The budget deficit will remain under control, but debt reduction will be slow
After a protracted period of stagnation, consumer prices have increased, largely owing to rising global energy costs. Demand-side inflationary pressures will remain subdued, owing to continued weak household consumption, labour market slack and high unemployment, as well as constrained wage growth.
Export growth and low global energy prices will keep Italy's current account in surplus during the forecast period. Nevertheless, concerns remain surrounding the erosion of the country's export competitiveness and stagnant productivity.

Policy towards private enterprise and competition remains an area in which Italy scores poorly compared with its EU peers, reflecting weak implementation and enforcement of competition rules. Generally, EU directives have been the main drivers of liberalisation in Italy, forcing successive governments-which, regardless of their political leaning, have not instinctively favoured compe-tition-to open up markets in several sectors, notably telecommuni-cations, energy and professional services. The powers of Italy's national Competition Authority were strengthened and its remit extended to cover the provision of public services in 2010, but political pressure has generally limited effectiveness. This is also true of other watchdogs, including the Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa (Consob), the public authority responsible for regulating the Italian securities market, and the telecoms watchdog, Autorità per le Garanzie nelle Comunicazioni (AGCOM).
External constraints will continue to be the main drivers of liberalisation
In 2012 the then technocratic government led by Mario Monti, which came to power in late 2011 when Italy was threatened with losing financial market access at the height of the euro zone crisis, introduced a range of measures, including provisions to increase competition in retailing, taxi services, the sale of pharmaceuticals and utilities. The government also abolished minimum tariffs for several professions, including lawyers. In 2014-16 the Renzi govern-ment continued earlier progress in cutting red tape affecting businesses, stream-lining the complex tax system and, in particular, simplifying and reducing regulation of the Italian labour market. The introduction of reforms following the stress tests of the European Central Bank (ECB) in 2014 has reduced the influence of minority shareholder local charitable foundations in Italy's co-operative banks (banche popolari), paving the way for greater competition, consolidation and mergers. However, consolidation has been slow, owing to reticence to write down bad loans and new EU bail-in rules that require losses to be imposed on shareholders and junior bondholders, who are often retail investors, in return for government support.
Weak contract enforcement, few convictions for white-collar crime, and notoriously long court case backlogs will remain a prominent deterrent of foreign direct investment (FDI) and domestic business investment. A reform package passed by parliament included provisions extending prison sentences for some white-collar crimes such as bribery, and setting up support offices to reduce the backlog in Italy's Supreme Court. However, resistance to change is strong in the judiciary, which for example has found ways round a reduction in the number of days' holiday for judges from 45 to 32. Other important law reform proposals, such as extending the statute of limitations for serious crimes, have also been delayed owing to divisions in the governing coalition and resistance from the judiciary. With the next election due in early 2018 and political instability likely to continue after the vote, further major reforms are unlikely.
Further privatisations likely to be delayed until after the general election
Privatisation plans are likely to face continued delays partly for political reasons but also because market conditions will not always be favourable. In mid-2015 the Renzi government re-launched its privatisation plans to highlight Italy's openness to foreign investment and reduce the public debt. It resulted in the largest auction of a state asset in a decade-the sale of a 35% stake in the national post office and financial services group, Poste Italiane, for EUR3.4bn in October 2015-and the transfer of another 35% to the state investment fund, the Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP). The sale of the remaining 30% has been subject to repeated delays, however, as has the mooted sale of a 40% stake in Ferrovie dello Stato, Italy's state-owned railway utility group. In 2016 revenue from privatisation amounted to 0.1% of GDP, well short of the government's target of 0.5% of GDP. Little progress is expected in 2017 ahead of the next general election, although the sale to the CDP of stakes in state-controlled firms such as the energy conglomerates, Eni and Enel, might go ahead to boost revenue.

The positive impact of economic reforms will only be felt incrementally
FDI inflows into Italy have generally been low compared with other similarly sized countries, including those such as France that have traditionally been seen as no more open than Italy. The main deterrents to FDI in Italy relate to complex bureaucratic and legal procedures, barriers to entry in areas of the services sector, inadequate infrastructure, high levels of taxation and energy costs, and labour market rigidities. Labour market reforms, modest business tax cuts and streamlining of Italy's complex tax system have begun to address some of these issues, resulting in an improvement in Italy's score and rankings in this category. However, given the economy's long-standing structural deficiencies, and the likelihood that the impact of recent reforms will be felt incrementally, inward FDI in Italy will continue to lag that in other large EU member states.
The collapse of the former state airline, Alitalia, in May 2017 highlights the difficulty of operating in Italy, even for major overseas investors such as Etihad, a UAE-based airline that bought a 49% stake in Alitalia in 2014. In April 2017 workers rejected a restructuring plan, causing much-needed financing from the airline's investors to fall through. The airline is now in the hands of three special administrators who have six months to sell the airline or liquidate it. A bridge loan from the government is keeping the carrier afloat in the meantime.
Judicial reforms introduced during 2014-16 should gradually improve contract enforcement, with signs that they are already reducing civil case backlogs. Legislation passed in 2015 should also encourage further financial sector consolidation, which could eventually attract FDI in the banking sector, although there has been no visible progress so far. The sale of banks' securitized bad loans to foreign investors has also been dogged by bureaucratic complexity. Although less ambitious than hoped for, anti-corruption legislation introduced since 2013 represents a further sign of intent to improve the operating environment for domestic and overseas investors.
Foreign takeovers, especially of Italian luxury goods brands likely to continue
Corporate balance sheets and the ability to raise capital were severely damaged by the 2011-14 economic downturn. As a result, a rising number of inter-nationally renowned Italian corporate brands such as Bulgari, Valentino and Loro Piana have been acquired by foreign companies in recent years, particularly in the luxury and consumer goods sectors. An almost EUR50bn merger between an Italian luxury eyewear company, Luxottica, and a French lens manufacturer, Essilor, also took place in January 2017, with the merged firm to be listed in Paris, the French capital. Despite signs of concerns among some law-makers regarding foreign takeovers, the trend is likely to continue during the forecast period. As illustrated by the Fiat takeover of Chrysler in 2014 and the recent bid by the Italian road toll company, Atlantia, for its Spanish partner, Abertis, large Italian firms are seeking opportunities to invest abroad.

Italy's EU membership determines the country's foreign trade and exchange policy. Full freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and persons exists within the EU (subject to transitional restrictions for newer member states), and we do not expect any exchange controls. Bilateral trade disputes between EU countries are resolved by the European Commission or, in extremis, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the jurisprudence of which has played a major role in developing the single market. Compliance with judicial or other rulings within the EU is higher than in other regional trading blocs or the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Trade with Nordic neighbours Norway and Iceland is unrestricted under the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The EU has a customs union with Turkey and a range of bilateral agreements with Switzerland. All these arrangements exclude agriculture.
In other sectors trade with non-EU countries is mostly subject to moderate customs duties. The EU takes a liberal approach to trade in industrial goods, with average unweighted most favoured nation tariffs, which cover most countries, at about 4%. Trade between member states and third countries has been largely gov-erned by multilateral agreements administered by the WTO. In 2015 the WTO reached an agreement on trade facilitation (reducing red tape at borders, and setting binding standards for customs and movement of goods internationally), but the Doha trade talks have stalled since 2008 and are unlikely to be revived.
The EU is increasingly looking to bilateral agreements to boost trade, such as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) signed with Canada. However, the stalled EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is unlikely to reach conclusion following the election of Donald Trump as US president.
Brexit to dominate EU trade agenda during 2017-19
The EU's trade agenda over the coming years is set to be dominated by negotiations with the UK, ahead of Britain's formal departure from the EU in 2019. Early signs suggest these Brexit negotiations could become acrimonious, which will decrease prospects for a satisfactory final agreement. As its third most important EU export market, Italy would be a major loser from failure to secure a satisfactory EU-UK free trade agreement.

Italy's tax system remains highly complex so compliance is costly
Italy ranks second from last of our global ranking for taxation and bottom in our regional ranking during the forecast period. Notwithstanding some recent simplifications and streamlining, the tax system is highly complex, making compliance costly and time consuming for private-sector companies. Also, despite some modest tax cuts since 2014, the tax burden has remained high and is unlikely to decline much, owing to a substantial public debt burden and EU sovereign debt reduction requirements. According to Istat (the national statistics office), total tax revenue/GDP (including social security contributions) stood at 42.9% in 2016, only slightly lower than the previous year, but higher than the regional aggregates of about 40% for the EU and euro area.
According to Eurostat data, Italy has the highest implicit tax rate on labour in the EU (aggregate tax revenue from labour as a percentage of the potential tax base). This was 43.9% in 2014, more than six percentage points above the EU average, and more than 4 points higher than the euro area aggregate. However, at 18.1%, Italy's implicit tax rate on consumption in 2014 was about 2 percentage points lower than the regional average, highlighting this as an area to which fiscal tightening could be shifted from the excessive reliance on labour levies.
Despite promises to reduce levies in 2016-18, labour taxes will remain high
In addition to a corporate tax rate of 24%, businesses also pay a regional business tax (IRAP), which is levied at a standard rate of 3.9%, and a slightly higher rate for most financial institutions. However, the central government can raise the regional business tax rate as high as 4.4% in regions running budget deficits. Regions and municipalities also apply personal income surtaxes at varying rates to offset the impact of cuts in transfers from the central government, which have been an almost constant feature of budget adjustments in recent years. Despite the high tax burden, fiscal adjustment plans during the height of the euro zone crisis in 2010-13 tended to focus mainly on raising additional revenue rather than more politically sensitive spending cuts. The Renzi government introduced some tax cuts, but with government debt at more than 130% of GDP, the room for fiscal loosening was limited.
In July 2015 Mr Renzi announced plans for a programme of tax cuts of about EUR35bn in 2016-18. A reduction in levies on primary residences, affecting 80% of households, was included in the 2016 budget. A planned cut in the rate of corporate tax for non-financial corporations-by 3.5 percentage points, from 27.5% to 24%-was delayed by one year but has taken affect in 2017. Banks and most other financial sector firms, however, were excluded from the new tax cut and continue to pay the 27.5% rate. Although another reduction in personal income tax is scheduled to follow in the 2018 budget, this might be dependent on economic growth in 2017, and any changes in future fiscal policy will be dependent on the composition of Italy's post-election government in 2018.
Efforts to reduce tax evasion have had some success and are likely to continue
The determination with which tax evasion and avoidance has been tackled since 2006 appears to have had at least a temporarily positive effect on compliance. Tackling evasion was a priority of Mr Monti's government, and has remained so for subsequent administrations. A tough stance towards tax evasion will remain a priority for the current government, which has extended deadlines through 2017 for the voluntary submission of undeclared incomes and assets held abroad.

Italy's position in this category has slipped in both our global and regional rankings in the forecast period, largely reflecting the fact that reforms to address the Italian banking sector's weaknesses were delayed compared with other countries. Although the sector has begun a belated process of capital-raising, consolidation and restructuring, it continues to be weighed down by an exceptionally large stock of non-performing loans (NPLs), low levels of profitability and uncertainty about the quality of past supervision. However, bad loans declined in 2016 for the first year since the global financial crisis. Although financing conditions for banks and the sovereign have been stable for several years, partially owing to the ECB's bond purchasing programme (quantitative easing), benchmark ten-year government bond yields have widened since mid-2016. After several years of contraction or stagnation, bank credit to the private sector has expanded modestly since the beginning of 2016. The stabilisation in lending marks an important development for Italy's large number of small and medium-sized enterprises that rely largely on bank borrowing for financing.
Tighter monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve (the US central bank) and a gradual tapering of the ECB's quantitative easing (QE) programme from 2018 are likely to put upward pressure on government borrowing costs, which could also increase the cost of bank credit. Financial market volatility could also increase if, as we expect, political instability rises after the parliamentary election in early 2018.
The 2014 asset quality review highlighted the long-standing structural weaknesses associated with Italy's banking system, including the excessive influence of politically affiliated local charitable organisations within co-operative banks, which have restricted the banks' ability to raise capital and expand activities. In April 2016 new legislation took affect forcing the ten largest co-operative banks, with combined assets of about EUR500bn, to change their ownership structures and establish joint-stock companies by the end of 2016. By reducing the voting rights of minority local charitable foundations, whose interests are not purely commercial, the legislation enhanced the prospects for future banking consolidation. The merger of Banca Popolare di Milano (BPM) and Banco Popolare (BP) in January 2017 was the first major bank merger in Italy in a decade, creating the country's third-largest banking group by assets.
Despite the BPM-BP merger and recent reforms, efforts to repair Italy's banking system have been beset with difficulties, largely relating to new EU bail-in rules, which require losses to be imposed on shareholders and junior bondholders before government support can be granted. Although the state is ultimately likely to compensate small investors' losses, the bail-in rules have provided political capital for anti-establishment political parties and restricted government willingness to speed up bank resolutions.
UniCredit, Italy's largest bank by assets, held a successful EUR13bn rights issue in February 2017 following an earlier write-down of bad loans. Further capital-raising by Italian banks is expected in 2017-18, representing a major test of investor appetite in the Italian financial sector. Some banks, however, have been unable to raise sufficient funds, notably Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), which is awaiting the approval of the European Commission and the ECB of its restructuring plans before it can receive support from the Italian state. The government has set aside EUR20bn to rescue banks such as MPS that are unable to raise sufficient funds on capital markets. The smaller Banca Popolare di Vicenza (BpVi) and Veneto Banca will also require state support.
Sale of NPLs will continue to lag other euro area economies
Gross NPLs totalling about EUR349bn at the end of 2016, largely consisting of non-financial corporation loans, remain one of the main challenges facing the Italian banking sector and wider economy. The introduction of a partial government guarantee on the sale of securities to third parties, and the purchase of riskier bad loan tranches by Atlante, a private equity fund financed mainly by domestic banks, but also by the state investment fund, CDP, to recapitalise weak lenders and purchase NPLs was designed to kick start the sale of NPLs. However, the complexity of the guarantee arrangement, Atlante's limited funds, difficulty pricing corporate bad loans and Italy's slow judicial system have resulted in no significant sales of securitised NPLs as of mid-2017. The sale of bad loans will continue to lag that in other euro area economies, which also have large stocks of legacy NPLs, such as Ireland and Spain.
Atlante has arguably increased systemic risk through purchases of distressed bank equity by stronger institutions, and it might also have delayed more radical but necessary banking sector reform.

Recent reforms have contributed to improving the labour market score in the forecast period, but Italy's positions in the global and regional rankings are unchanged. Although the Renzi government's Jobs Act legislative package passed in 2014-15 was a welcome development, long-standing rigidities are only set to decline gradually, as the main reforms only apply to new private-sector hires. The reforms have significantly weakened employment protection for long-term contracts. At the same time they have created a much simplified contract system for labour market entrants by introduc-ing a standard open-ended employment contract with gradually increasing protection. The reform also reduces restrictions on the use of easily terminated fixed-term contracts, which can now be used for up to 36 months rather than the previous 12 months and account for up to 20% of the workforce of an individual firm. The reform has increased the availability of unemployment benefits, streamlined the use of wage guarantee funds for temporary lay-offs or firm restructuring, and established a new national agency to monitor and co-ordinate the activities of all employment services providers.
Positive effect of the Jobs Act is only likely to be felt over the medium term
Reflecting the impact of a protracted recession, delayed reforms and weak economic recovery since late 2014, Italy's headline jobless rate remains high, at 11.7% in March 2017, compared with the euro area average of 9.5%. The youth unemployment rate was 34.1%-the third-highest in the euro area and well above the 19.4% euro area average. Despite some recent improvement, Italian labour market participation remains low, particularly among women and young people. According to Eurostat, Italy's employment rate was 57.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with the euro area average of 65.8%. The female employment rate was 48.3%, compared with 60.7% in the euro area.
Unions and employers appear to be no closer to agreeing on the compre-hensive implementation of a wage bargaining system that puts greater emphasis on firm-level negotiations to ensure that wage increases are tied to productivity gains. Greater use of second-level (plant) agreements would allow Italy to regain some of its lost export competitiveness, which has accompanied a decade of flat productivity growth and moderately rising wages. Such measures would also address regional disparities in productivity, and boost job-creation prospects in poorer southern regions where structural unemployment is most prevalent.

Infrastructure quality in the south will continue to lag the rest of the country
As reflected in its unchanged score and the decline in its regional and global rankings, the quality of Italy's infrastructure is set to remain below the average of other developed countries during the forecast period. A significant disparity between the north and the south of the country will also continue. Budgetary constraints have limited public investment in the past 25-30 years, and local interest groups have succeeded in blocking or delaying several major projects in the transport and energy sectors. Corruption investigations are another relatively common reason for delays. Telecoms costs have fallen and device ownership has risen, along with internet use and broadband penetration, but Italy continues to lag most other developed countries in these markets.
Budgetary constraints will remain a major stumbling block to future government capital spending projects over the forecast period. In 2014-16 the Renzi government was a vocal proponent of relaxing EU fiscal rules to boost public capital investment projects. However, Italy used the limited room for fiscal manoeuvre mainly for tax cuts rather than infrastructure investment.
Infrastructure projects were expected to benefit greatly from the EUR315bn invest-ment plan put forward by the European Commission and the European Invest--ment Bank in late 2014. However, two years since it became operational, little funding has found its way to the EU or Italian infrastructure projects, and a large number of projects that have formally had funding approved have yet to start.
Fiscal consolidation will hold back public investment in infrastructure
Investment is likely to be mainly focused on improving the current rail, ports, motorway and other transport networks across the country. However, as resources are limited, few major improvements are likely to materialise during the forecast period. The 2017 budget law extended modest cuts in regional business taxes for some public construction projects and a new tax credit for research and development (R&D) investment. Resources are available for earthquake-hit areas, which will include infrastructure reconstruction projects, although similar schemes have proven disappointing in the past.
Limited domestic energy sources and popular opposition to the development of nuclear-power generation will continue to cause uncertainty about security and diversification of supply. Poor infrastructure in energy distribution is likely to keep upward pressure on costs. Investment will also continue to face strong local resistance.
In 2016 fixed-line broadband penetration reached an estimated 55% of house-holds, compared with an EU average of 74%. However, above-average mobile-phone penetration rates and the rapid take-up of smartphones and high-speed mobile contracts could explain some, or even all, of the gap. We expect the fixed-line broadband penetration rate to rise to about 30% by 2021, by which time almost all subscriptions are likely to be broadband connections.
Government efforts to accelerate investment in fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) networks providing high-speed internet access will make gradual progress. Central to the government's plans has been the metropolitan fibre-optic operator, Metroweb, which in December 2016 merged with a subsidiary of Enel, the state controlled energy utility, to form Open Fiber. Open Fiber, which is now jointly owned by Enel and CDP, plans to build FTTH networks in 250 cities in Italy by 2030, investing EUR3.7bn in the development of the network, 85% of this by 2021.
Economic forecast: Policy trends

The political uncertainty that has taken hold since the referendum in December 2016 has increased the potential for financial volatility, and could disrupt the current fragile economic recovery and further delay structural reforms, at least in the short term. We believe that the European Central Bank (ECB) will have sufficient tools at its disposal to contain any financial market turmoil. However, weakened investor confidence could disrupt efforts to repair the weaknesses in Italy's banking system-high operating costs, low profitability, a EUR349bn burden of non-performing loans at end-2016 and uncertainty about the quality of supervision-and cause already depressed bank shares to slide further. The referendum vote derailed the government-endorsed private-sector rescue plan for Italy's third-largest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS). The government and the bank are now engaged in talks with the European Commission and the ECB regarding plans for a precautionary recapitalisation of MPS, which requires about EUR8.8bn in fresh funding, according to the ECB. The uncertainty about MPS has had negative knock-on effects for several smaller beleaguered lenders that also need to attract private capital to increase their capital buffers. In contrast, UniCredit, Italy's largest bank, which completed a massive capital raising operation in March 2017 on the back of an ambitious restructuring plan, will not require assistance from the state.
Reforms to the labour market, the judicial system and the public administration that have been introduced in recent years are likely to have a positive effect on growth performance, but only over the medium term. However, there is a risk that some aspects of these reforms will be diluted or reversed in the next parliament.

The Renzi government used the little room for manoeuvre that it had, arising from low interest rates on government debt and some "fiscal flexibility" granted by the EU for structural reforms, to try to support economic growth without breaching the EU-wide deficit limit of 3% of GDP. Following a shortfall of 2.4% of GDP in 2016, we expect the deficit to remain broadly unchanged in 2017-18, as political constraints and an impending general election make any bolder efforts at fiscal consolidation difficult. From 2019 we forecast that the deficit will widen gradually to close to 3% by 2021 as interest payments rise once again, offsetting solid primary surpluses of 2% of GDP per year. We expect that the government debt/GDP ratio peaked in 2016, at 132.5%, and that it will decline only marginally to around 130% at end-2021.

Despite heightened political risk, the euro zone economy is showing increasing momentum and we expect another healthy expansion in the region's economy this year, after growth of 1.8% on average in 2015-16. Nonetheless, the ECB is continuing to pursue an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero, a series of so-called targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) aimed at pushing banks to lend more money and a EUR60bn per month quantitative easing (QE) programme, which will run until the end of 2017.
The ECB's president, Mario Draghi, stressed that the reduction in the pace of QE (from EUR80bn per month in March) was designed to sustain the bank's presence in the market for a longer period, and should not be viewed as "tapering", which would signify a winding down of the programme. We expect tapering to begin in 2018, but downside risks to global growth during that year, including our forecast for an economic slowdown in China and tighter monetary policy in the US, suggest that the pace at which the ECB unwinds its accommodative policy stance will be gradual. We maintain our forecast that the ECB will not tighten policy rates before the end of our forecast period, in 2021.

Despite our expectation that political instability will persist beyond the end of the current parliamentary term, we expect that domestic demand growth will continue to sustain the moderate economic recovery that began in 2014. Following real GDP growth of 1% in 2016, we expect that the economy will expand by 0.9% in 2017 (revised up from 0.8% previously), as weak consumer sentiment, concerns about instability in the banking sector and uncertainty about external conditions dampen economic activity. In 2018-21 we forecast that real GDP growth will average 0.9% per year.
We expect the boost to household disposable income and consumption from modest tax cuts and low oil prices to diminish in 2017, slowing private consump-tion growth this year. Fragile consumer sentiment, reflecting political instability, concern about the impact on savings of protracted difficulties in the banking sector and modest employment growth will continue to hold back private consumption growth, which we forecast to average 0.8% per year in 2017-21.

We expect that the return to public consumption growth in 2016 after five consecutive years of contraction will be sustained in 2017-21. We expect the pace of expansion to remain modest, however, driven by the need to control the budget deficit.
Owing to public investment cuts, weak business sentiment and difficulty accessing bank credit, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, fixed investment at end-2015 was almost 30% below its level prior to the 2008-09 global crisis. Fixed investment returned to growth in 2015-16, but we expect growth to be moderate in 2017-21, held back by domestic demand constraints and risks to external demand. The need to replace ageing machinery and equipment, the extension of tax incentives, post-earthquake reconstruction and a gradual easing of access to credit should prevent further contractions during the forecast period.
We expect the slowdown in exports of goods and services growth in 2016 to continue in 2017-19, reflecting uncertainty in the EU and emerging markets in 2017, a sharp slowdown in the Chinese economy in 2018 and a cyclical downturn in the US in 2019. A modest acceleration should get under way in 2020-21. Reflecting moderate domestic demand growth and external demand constraints, we expect import growth to outpace that of exports during most of the forecast period.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Reflecting the severe impact on the industrial sector of the 2008-o9 global crisis and the subsequent ongoing euro area crisis, industry (excluding construction) accounted for about 20% of employment in 2016, down from 22.1% in 2007, and 19.3% of nominal gross value added, compared with 20.5% of gross value added in 2007. The manufacturing sector has long been the main strength of the Italian economy, especially Italy's family-owned, small and medium-sized export-oriented companies specialising in products that require high-quality design and engineering. However, the sector faces major challenges owing to Italy's structural problems, the uncertainties arising from the euro zone crisis and uncertainty about the global economic outlook caused by the UK's decision to leave EU and our expectation of a sharp slowdown in China in 2018 and a cyclical downturn in the US in 2019.
Italian industry faces major challenges owing to structural deficiencies
In 2016 manufacturing accounted for 16.3% of gross value added, down from 17.8% in 2007 and 20.3% in 1997. The sector's decline has largely been driven by the prolonged weakness of domestic demand, but also by the difficulties that Italian exporters face in remaining competitive within the European single currency area. Unit labour costs have remained well above the euro area average since 2005 and have continued to rise in Italy since 2010, whereas they have fallen in other peripheral euro area economies such as Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Weak competitiveness and further transfers of low-value-added production out of Italy are likely to lead to a further decline in manufacturing's contribution to the economy during the forecast period.
The automotive industry is one of the flagship sectors of Italian industry. It accounts for about 8% of GDP, almost one-quarter of the contribution from all manufacturing industries and about 10% of the total value of Italian exports. Fiat (Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino), which was renamed Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) in 2014 after merging with a US-based producer, is the dominant producer in Italy, but the sector also comprises hundreds of firms that manufacture components or provide related services.
After declining in 2008-13, vehicle production in Italy picked up by 6% in 2014, 45% in 2015 and 8.8% in 2016, to reach 1.1m units, approaching 2007 levels. The fall in 2008-13 reflected the impact of the global economic crisis on demand in Italy and in export markets, as well as the transfer of production to lower-cost countries. A recovery in domestic and external demand drove the rise in output in 2014, whereas the double-digit increase in 2015 was largely driven by the addition of two new models to the FCA's production line at the Melfi factory in southern Italy. The drop in Italian production affected passenger-car output disproportionately. In 2013 passenger-car output was more than 70% lower than in 2000. Following a modest increase of 3% in 2014, Italian passenger-car production rose by 65% in 2015 and 7.5% in 2016.
We expect car registrations in Italy to decline by 4.5% in 2017 as political and economic uncertainty in Italy continue and rising inflation starts to eat into real wages. The decline in sales will also be driven by higher year-on-year comparisons. We forecast that growth will return only gradually, averaging about 3% in 2018-21. Commercial vehicle sales are also forecast to decline in 2017, by about 4%, and rise by 5.5% on average in 2018-21.
Fiat's strategy to become a major global producer through mergers, acquisitions and alliances abroad is proving challenging and will probably not boost production in Italy, even if it is successful. Given Italy's high labour costs and other difficulties of doing business in the country, the recent trend of shifting automotive production out of Italy is likely to continue, despite FCA's repeated promise to increase domestic production. Fiat now produces about two-thirds of its vehicles abroad, in China, Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Serbia, Poland and elsewhere. It closed its Termini Imerese plant in Sicily at the end of 2011 and began producing cars at a new plant in Serbia in the first half of 2012. Integration with Chrysler could also result in more production being transferred to plants outside Italy. Following an agreement with the trade unions to introduce more flexible working practices and boost productivity and output at its plant at Pomigliano d'Arco, near Naples, the company transferred production of one of its models from Poland at the beginning of 2012. However, production at the plant was interrupted or reduced at various times during the economic crisis, when demand in the Italian and wider European car markets contracted.
Manufacturing sector performance will depend on the speed of the reforms
In the medium term, the performance of the manufacturing sector will depend largely on the implementation of reforms to tackle Italy's structural deficiencies. These include issues such as a lack of competition, particularly in the non­tradeable services sectors and utilities, which has meant that companies in Italy pay high prices for domestically produced inputs, such as electricity, compared with competitors elsewhere. The predominance of small companies and their lack of investment in areas such as innovation and research and development (R&D) has prevented them from moving up the value-added chain. There are about 450,000 manufacturing companies in Italy, about 98% of which employ fewer than 50 people. Firms with fewer than ten employees account for about 8o% of the total.
Italian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are often aggregated within sector-specific industrial districts, which, through a combination of co-operation and competition, help to mitigate the impact of the difficulties arising from a lack of expansion. According to the Edison Foundation, a think-tank that monitors 99 industrial districts, exports from the industrial districts fell sharply in euro terms in 2009, but have risen strongly since the beginning of 2010, and previously marginal hi-tech districts have increased their weighting in the index as they have outperformed the overall index and Italy's traditional low-tech manufacturing sectors such as clothing and textiles, and home furniture.
Italian SMEs have begun to consolidate under the pressure of intense competition and the global crisis. However, the availability of domestic funds to support mergers or recapitalisations to start new projects is likely to be curtailed by the need to reduce the government debt burden. This has contributed to a rising number of internationally renowned Italian corporate brands being acquired by foreign companies in recent years, particularly in the luxury and consumer goods sectors. Global designer brands such as Bulgari, Valentino and Lora Piana have been sold to foreign groups, and as of mid­2014 Indesit, Italy's main manufacturer of white goods, is no longer majority Italian owned. This trend is likely to continue during the forecast period.
Construction sector activity is likely to remain subdued in 2016-20
Activity in the construction sector accounted for 4.8% of gross value added in 2016, unchanged from 2015, but down from an annual average of 6% of gross value added in 2006-09, and 6.2% of employment in 2016, compared with 8.6% in 2007. After nine full-year contractions, which left output in the sector about a third below its 2006 peak in real terms, the decline appeared to bottom out in the final quarter of 2014, but activity is likely to remain subdued during the forecast period, reflecting the impact of an eight-year decline in property prices up to 2016. Ongoing corruption investigations involving public works contracts and large government spending cuts are also likely to dampen activity. Various governments have sought to accelerate EU co-financed infrastructure invest-ment plans to provide some support to the sector, but little progress is likely to be made, largely owing to delays at the regional and ministerial levels.
Already accounting for almost 74% of gross value added, the services sector is expected to expand broadly in line with subdued average real GDP growth during the forecast period. Those subsectors that are exposed to foreign competition, such as tourism, are likely to struggle, although a weaker euro during the first half of the forecast period and security concerns in several competitor markets could help. Sectors that serve mainly the domestic market and have so far enjoyed a high level of protection from competition, such as the professions and retailing, will come under pressure as a result of reforms to reduce barriers to entry, but this is likely to be only gradual. High-value­added services sectors, such as design, which are closely tied to clothing, textiles and automotives, Italy's main export sectors, should continue to perform well, even though in some sectors production is increasingly being moved abroad to countries where labour costs are lower.

Following annual average consumer price inflation of -0.1% (EU harmonised measure, seasonally adjusted) in 2016, we expect inflation of 1.7% in 2017 (revised up from 1.4% previously), driven largely by higher global energy prices rather than strong demand-led price pressures. Inflation will then slow to an average of 1% in 2018, reflecting base effects, before accelerating to an annual average rate of 1.4% per year in 2019-21, broadly in line with euro zone average inflation rates.

The euro has moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1 since mid-2015. It averaged US$1.11:EUR1 in 2016, with a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1, reflecting the sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following Donald Trump's election victory in the US. We forecast an annual average rate of US$1.06:EUR1 in 2017 and US$1.07:EUR1 in 2018, reflecting heightened political risk in Europe and strong growth in the US, with the euro then appreciating gradually in 2019-21. We do not expect the euro to return to its long-term average value against the dollar even by the end of the forecast period.

We expect the markedly improved current-account balance since 2012 to persist in 2017-21, driven mainly by continued low international energy prices and moderate domestic demand growth. We forecast that slightly higher commodity prices and moderate external demand growth will gradually reduce the surplus, from an average of 2.5% of GDP per year in 2017-18 to 1.8% in 2021.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Italy
Stocks and flows
Net inward foreign direct investment (FDI) flows are low compared with most other EU countries, and Italy has generally been a net exporter of FDI. Net inflows to Italy picked up to US$34.4bn in 2011 (1.5% of GDP), from about US$10bn (0.5% of GDP) in 2010, but declined again to close to zero in 2012, owing to large disinvestments. Net inflows recovered moderately in 2013-15, averaging US$16.5bn per year (0.8% of GDP). We estimate that inward FDI rose to US$26.5bn in 2016, the equivalent of 1.4% of GDP. Italy attracts less green-field foreign investment than other large European economies. The total stock of FDI was US$457bn in 2015, compared with about US$800bn in France and about one-third of that in the UK and Germany. In relation to GDP, the stock of FDI was 25% in 2015, compared with 22.9% in 2014, lower than in any other EU country apart from Greece. FDI outflows have also generally been quite small, mainly reflecting the prevalence of small and medium-sized companies in Italy. In 2005-09 Italy recorded substantial outward FDI flows as a result of several major investments abroad in the banking and energy sectors. A similarly large outflow, of about US$52bn, was recorded in 2011, the year that Italian car manufacturer Fiat (Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino) bought the US Treasury's remaining stake in Chrysler.
Origin and distribution
FDI from Europe accounts for about 60-65% of company revenue and employment generated by foreign companies with operations in Italy. Companies from North America represent about 25-30% of revenue and employment, and those from Japan for about 3-4%. The manufacturing sector contributed about 40% of the total revenue and value added of foreign­owned firms, but this has generally been on a downward path and dropped sharply in 2005, when General Motors (US) sold its stake in Fiat. The utilities and telecommunications sectors have registered the most rapid expansion.
Determinants
The main attraction for foreign companies to set up operations in Italy is the size of the domestic market, which offers a population of about 6om and average GDP per head of US$38,5oo, at purchasing power parity (PPP). Deterrents include the complexity of Italy's legal system, inefficiencies in public administration, inadequate infrastructure-particularly in the south of the country-and often high regulatory barriers to entry, especially in services sectors. In addition, studies of the determinants of FDI in southern Italy have highlighted classical deterrents to investment, such as distance from major European markets, low presence of other foreign companies and a high level of organised crime. Such studies seem to indicate that fiscal incentives and the presence of specialised producer service providers have a low impact on foreign entrants' decisions, but that human capital is an important positive variable. Italy has an abundant workforce in the south, which has attracted a few high-technology investments to areas such as Catania in Sicily, where a Franco-Italian joint venture, ST Microelectronics, has a production plant and several research centres.
Impact
According to the industry association, Confindustria, foreign-controlled companies employ more than 1m people in Italy and generate revenue of about EUR5oobn per year. Foreign companies invest on average three and half times more in research and development (R&D) than Italian companies. However, because of the comparatively low level of inflows and their concentration in the north of Italy, the impact of FDI on the Italian economy as a whole has been limited. The depressed areas of the south, which attract limited Italian private-sector investment, would benefit substantially in terms of employment and through the spillover effect of advanced technology, management practices and production processes. However, almost all of the inward FDI stock is located in the north and centre of the country. Despite massive state investment in 1950-84, the south has continued to lag central Italy and the north in GDP per head terms (less than 55% of the average in the centre and north). The unemployment rate in the south is almost double the national average and about two and a half times higher than that in the north.
Potential
The possibility of higher FDI inflows in the forecast period will be hampered by the uncertainty caused by the euro zone crisis and the fact that most of the factors that have deterred FDI in the past will remain in place. A slight improvement is expected in the efficiency of the public administration, as a result of recent and ongoing reforms. The performance of the state body responsible for attracting foreign investors may also improve. Given Italy's need to reduce its dependence on imported energy, there could be potential for investment in the still state-dominated energy sector as liberalisation continues to make progress and the authorities are forced to focus on investment in renewable energy sources, following the decision in mid-2011 to abandon plans to return to nuclear-power generation. Despite the current government's openness to foreign investors, political opposition to foreign interest in ownership of utility networks and possibly even some companies in the manufacturing sector is likely to continue, as such companies are deemed to be of a "strategic" nature. Banking sector reforms may increase opportunities for foreign investment in smaller Italian banks, but there appears to be limited interest at present.

Italy is a major market, but growth potential remains limited
Italy is one of the largest markets in Europe, with a population of just under 60m, and is one of its most affluent nations. However, growth potential remains limited because the country is a mature consumer market with weak income and population growth prospects.
In 2015 the economy began to emerge from a protracted recession. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the recovery to continue during the forecast period (2017-21) but domestic demand growth will remain subdued, given high unemployment, weak business investment, the ongoing need for fiscal consolidation in Italy and elsewhere in the developed world, high taxation and moderate wage growth.
In terms of private consumption per head, Italy is more or less on a par with the euro area average, but well below Finland, Sweden, France and Germany. However, the relative weakness of Italian economic growth for much of the past 15-20 years means that GDP per head-at purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion rates that explicitly adjust for differences in price levels between countries-has fallen steadily as a percentage of the EU28 average, remaining below 100% since 2013. GDP per head at PPP rates stood at US$38,504 in 2015.
Income levels differ greatly on a regional basis, with GDP per head in the south less than 55% of that in the centre and the north. Development policies in the past 50 years have done little to close the gap, and no significant change is expected.

Despite relatively high income levels, spending on food, beverages and tobacco is still high as a share of total consumer spending, at about 18%-similar to the level in France but above that in Germany and the Netherlands (about 15%), and the UK (just under 13%). We expect it to decline only gradually during the forecast period, largely because of subdued spending on other categories of goods and services.
Consumer credit demand has begun to rise, after several years of stagnation and/or contraction. Household indebtedness is relatively low and interest rates on consumer loans have declined and are expected to rise only moderately in 2017-21, containing the proportion of disposable income spent on debt servicing. Still, we expect only moderately stronger demand for big-ticket items and branded goods, as consumers are likely to postpone purchases until sen-timent improves further and risks to the recovery diminish. Rates of ownership of traditional consumer durable goods, such as white goods and passenger cars, are generally high, so demand will be driven by technological change and the need to replace ageing stock.
Demand for electronic goods, such as computers (especially laptops and tablets) and smartphones, has shown a tendency to outperform the rest of the consumer goods market. Growth will be driven by innovations such as smartphones, tablet computers and, more recently, wearable technology. However, weak income growth will dampen demand. Personal computer (PC) ownership lags well behind countries such as the UK, Germany and France, where the penetration rate is about 90%, compared with about 65% in Italy; however, much of the gap is expected to have been closed by the end of the forecast period.
The ageing population will drive growth in healthcare spending
Demographic trends will have an important impact on spending patterns. The ageing population will continue to drive overall healthcare spending, but we expect efforts to curb public healthcare expenditure to meet budgetary targets.
Italians tend to live at home with their parents, often until their mid-thirties. Thus, a larger portion of the disposable income of those aged 18-35 has tended to be spent on leisure and consumer goods than in other countries, although this trend is likely to be offset by low salaries for many young people who have work and one of the highest youth unemployment rates (among the 15-24 age group) in Europe, despite declining gradually in recent years. In March 2017 it was 34.1%, down from a peak of 44% in March 2014-almost double pre-crisis levels in 2007-08.

Initial conditions: Italy's economic growth performance has been poor in the past two decades, even in comparison with the sluggish average rate of growth achieved by core countries within the EU. Besides undergoing severe fiscal consolidation during the 1990s in order to join the euro area, which dampened growth in that decade, the Italian economy has suffered from a steady loss of competitiveness owing to low productivity growth and rising unit labour costs (reflecting falling output, despite wage moderation since 1993)-in contrast to the situation in its main trading partners.
The weakness of Italy's political and institutional framework policy hinders policy formulation, as reforms are frequently delayed or watered down under pressure from a wide range of interest groups. Italy's public finances also remain weak, limiting the scope to reduce taxation or stimulate demand during cyclical downturns. Major brakes on Italy's long-term growth will be the country's unfavourable demographic profile, low labour participation rates, a collapse in fixed investment during the recent recession, and low levels of investment in research and development (R&D).
Italy's demographic profile will be the main brake on long-term growth
Demographic trends: Italy's demographic profile is particularly unfavourable. Projected net immigration is expected to be insufficient to halt the continued decline in the population of working age in the long-term forecast period up to 2050. Italy's labour market participation rate is expected to rise from current low levels of about 65%, but only moderately, reflecting an increase in the number of women joining the workforce and a gradual rise in the minimum retirement age, but it will remain well below the OECD average (about 71% in 2015) and will be insufficient to prevent an annual average decline in the labour force of 0.5% in 2017-50.
External conditions: The effects of the global crisis of 2008-09 and the height of the euro area crisis in 2010-13 will be felt for years. The risk that the sovereign debt crisis in financially stressed peripheral countries in the euro area, including Italy, could lead to a partial or even complete break-up of the single currency area, which would have severe negative consequences for Italy's long-term economic prospects, has eased, but The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that it is more likely than not (6o%) that Greece will leave the euro area by 2020. Even without Greece in the euro area, the euro zone member states are still a long way from resolving the structural shortcomings of the single currency area.
Italian companies have generally been slow to adapt to the rigours of fixed exchange rates in the euro area and the increase in competition from goods produced in low-cost developing countries, although some traditional manufacturing sectors have undergone restructuring in recent years, notably textiles and clothing, and also automotive. This difficulty seems unlikely to change in the medium to long term. In the past, clusters of family-owned small and medium-sized export-oriented manufacturing companies located in the so­called industrial districts in the north and centre of the country showed greater flexibility and ability to adapt to changing external conditions than Italy's few large companies. However, more recently they have struggled to compete in some low- to medium-technology sectors. This is attributed variously to the lack of investment in R&D and innovation and marketing, as well as to difficulties in protecting and promoting the generic ''Made in Italy" brand, which has long been considered synonymous with good quality and style. To survive, Italian companies will have to expand in size and increasingly outsource low-value-added production to locations in central and eastern Europe and Asia, where costs-especially labour costs-are lower. The reluctance to relinquish control will hinder the expansion of family-owned businesses, which also often face difficult choices in terms of management succession.
With institutional change off the agenda, economic reform will be slow
Institutions and policy trends: Italy's poor growth performance has raised concerns among policymakers about the country's future economic prospects. Policy responses triggered by such debates in the past have generally been short lived. Some reforms have been introduced since the financial turmoil of late 2011. However, popular and political resistance to reform halted the Renzi government's attempt to overhaul Italy's institutional framework in 2014-16, taking institutional change off the political agenda for the foreseeable future. Without a substantial improvement in its political and institutional framework, Italy's efforts to carry out reforms will continue to lag the rapid pace of change in the world economy and the increase in competition.
In particular, Italy will need further liberalisation of its product and services markets, although recent reforms, if they are not reversed-a possibility that cannot be ruled out-should help to reduce labour market rigidities over the medium to long term. A more comprehensive system of unemployment protection envisaged under the 2012 and 2014 reforms could help to enhance labour mobility, but there may be a lack of resources without more drastic cuts in public spending on pensions, which is projected to ease from a peak of about 16% of GDP in 2013-14 to about 15.5% in 2030, according to the Treasury (before rising again over the subsequent decade and falling again more sharply in the decade to 2050). To raise long-term productivity growth, the country will also have to improve the quality of human capital. Recent education reforms have sought to address shortcomings in the education system, including high drop-out rates and mismatches between the skills needed by employers and qualifications held by potential employees.
A more favourable policy environment would boost long-term growth
Long-term performance: Our baseline forecast is that Italian GDP growth will average 0.5% per year in 2017-50, which is considerably weaker than what was until recently considered to be Italy's trend rate of growth (1.5%). The main brake on long-term growth will be an unfavourable demographic profile, which will be offset only partly by expected moderate improvements in labour productivity and technological infrastructure. Other industrialised countries will continue to grow faster than Italy, and so it will fall further behind in terms of GDP per head, which in the decade to 2015 fell from 109% of the EU28 average to 96%. In addition, decades of massive public-sector spending have done little to narrow the large income gap between the more developed centre and north of Italy and the south of the country. This imbalance is expected to continue to weigh on Italy's overall growth performance in the long term. A more favourable political environment could produce a better economic growth performance in the long term, but the chance of improvements in Italy's institutional framework being implemented in the short to medium term is limited.

Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines ten separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, and infrastructure. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 16 (infrastructure), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2012-16) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2017-21). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2012-16. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2017-21 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
The main sources used in the business rankings model include CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce; Freedom House, Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties; Heritage Foundation, Index of Economic Freedom; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; UN, Human Development Report; US Social Security Administration, Social Security Programs Throughout the World; World Bank, World Development Report; World Development Indicators; Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Report.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2012-16 ranges are then used to derive 2017-21 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2017-21, not to the likely situation in 2021 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2014 or 2019). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text:   Nigeria--highlights: Political outlook
The government will largely fail to achieve its promises of tackling corruption, improving stability and boosting living standards. A period of significantly lower oil revenue will hinder the government's ability to boost development, particularly of infrastructure. As a result, high levels of poverty and unemployment will combine with the country's ethnic and religious divisions to create a potent mixture that will spill over into outbreaks of violence. Nevertheless, Nigeria has a high tolerance for political instability and so there is little significant threat to the government's position outside of the election cycle, even if the president were forced to leave office early owing to his ill health-a growing likelihood.

The population growth rate will remain high enough to retain a relatively stable age profile. However, the formal economy will not grow quickly enough to provide the employment needed to absorb the estimated 2m Nigerians entering the jobs market each year. This will jeopardise attempts to reduce poverty. Furthermore, high numbers of poor young unemployed will be a fertile recruiting ground for militant groups, thus prolonging violent instability in large parts of the country.

The business environment in Nigeria is unlikely to improve significantly over the forecast period. Even if progress is made, it will often be at a slower rate than in the country's peers. Systemic problems in infrastructure and the labour market mean that Nigeria remains towards the bottom of The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment global rankings for the forecast period, at 78th out of 82 countries. On a regional basis, Nigeria is ranked 15th out of 17 countries for the forecast period. Efforts to create a more attractive business environment are likely to produce only modest results owing to the slow pace of structural reform, the ongoing problem of corruption, the absence of effective government institutions and the weak capacity of the civil service to implement changes. Some improvements in infrastructure are expected over the forecast period, albeit from a very low base, as telecommunications infrastructure and ports (both benefiting from private-sector involvement) improve. However, power and much transport infrastructure will remain weak.

While Nigeria will escape the recession of 2016, economic growth will remain well below historic averages in 2017-21. Trends in the oil sector and elections in 2019 will have a negative impact on the economy. Inflation will spike in 2017, amid currency depreciation, but will then subside gradually amid tight monetary policy and weaker commodity prices. Economic policymakers will struggle to counter strong demand for increases in spending from the legis-lature and state-level governments, given pressing development needs. Set against this, oil sector revenue is likely to underperform, and so a fiscal deficit of around 2.5% of GDP will persist. The current account will be close to balance after decades of large surpluses, amid weak oil export revenue and strong import demand to fuel infrastructure development and growing consumer spending.

Nigeria remains an important market for many multinationals because of its abundant natural resources and the size of its population-the largest in Africa-despite the very low level of income among the majority of the population. However, the relatively large wealthy elite and growing middle class make up important submarkets. Nigeria is potentially a profitable market for multinational companies that know how to operate in its complex and chaotic regulatory environment and can overcome the logistical difficulties posed by the almost non-existent infrastructure, for example by providing their own power and water supplies.

Nigeria's long-term economic performance will pick up moderately, driven by gradual improvements in infrastructure provision. However, the reform effort is unlikely to be sufficient to promote fundamental diversification of the economy, meaning that Nigeria will remain heavily exposed to the oil and gas sector. Moreover, income levels will remain very low

a Actual. b Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960 and the army soon became the dominant political player. Multiparty democracy was restored in 1999. That presidential poll and the next one, in 2003, were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari in the 2015 presidential election-the first time an incumbent had been defeated at the ballot box and an important step forward for the country's democracy.
Political structure: Under the constitution, adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties dominate the political process. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the only political party to attract nationwide support, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015. Although the 36 state governments enjoy significant autonomy, almost all remain dependent on the federal government for funding.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. Meanwhile, the government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is a contentious issue, as efforts to promote exchange-rate stability worsen hard-currency shortages.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take very small as a share of GDP. Tax compliance is a time-consuming process.
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 has wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by an overvalued exchange rate and massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
Muhammadu Buhari-a former military dictator turned civilian politician-became president at the 2015 presidential election, while his All Progressives Congress (APC) swept to power at the concurrent legislative election. The ascension to power of Mr Buhari and the APC ended the 16-year rule of the People's Democratic Party (PDP). The APC also won power in the majority of state-level governments. Furthermore, the APC retained its hold on Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital, which meant that for the first time since 1999 the administrator of this important state was from the same party as the president. The cabinet must contain representatives from each of Nigeria's 36 states, although very few are elected politicians. Mr Buhari and his ministers are scrutinised by an elected, two-chamber National Assembly. State governments enjoy considerable autonomy under governors and elected state assemblies.

The APC is far from a united entity, however. It is an amalgamation of the three largest former opposition parties and a faction of a fourth (all with separate geographic and ethnic power bases, as well as varying ideologies), along with PDP defectors. Political appointments in numerous instances have, therefore, been based on distributing the vestiges of power among the APC's constituent elements rather than merit. This has been relatively successful in maintaining party backing for Mr Buhari, but large cracks are appearing-and are expected to widen-as the administration struggles to turn around Nigeria's struggling economy.
Political outlook: Political stability
Slow progress on tackling the various security and societal challenges at a time of economic difficulty means that The Economist Intelligence Unit expects repeated outbreaks of instability throughout the forecast period. Risks are heightened by the ongoing uncertainty over the health of the president, Muhammadu Buhari, who has spent much of early 2017 in the UK on medical grounds. Were Mr Buhari to suddenly leave office, we would expect him to be replaced by his vice-president, Yemi Osinbajo, for the remainder of his term (which expires in 2019). This is stipulated in the constitution and would replicate the situation in 2010 when the then vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, was promoted following the death of the then president, Umaru Yar'Adua. However, the transfer of power would bring with it a tense period as lines of patronage are broken and re-established, not least because of the move from a northern president to a southern one, an important and often fraught geopolitical divide in Nigeria. Such a period would distract policymakers at a time of significant economic and security challenges in Nigeria. Indeed, public resentment at the administration's failure to improve the economy or tackle corruption has already led to street protests in 2017. Nevertheless, democracy is entrenched in Nigeria to such a degree that a rise in political acrimony or public protests during the forecast period would not be likely to topple the government-or prompt the army to attempt to step in and take power. However, it would further disrupt business activity, negatively affect investor perceptions and hinder the economy.
Meanwhile, it will prove impossible to bring a permanent peace to large parts of Nigeria hit variously by Islamist insurgency in the north (which is increasing the risk of a major famine there with agricultural production decimated), ethno-nationalism in the main oil-producing region, secessionism in the region known as Biafra and inter-religious tensions across the centre of the country. The Nigerian authorities will periodically publicise advances made against insurgents, but we expect sporadic violent outbreaks to continue over the forecast period. The challenge facing the government remains that of building a more effective counterterrorism infrastructure while also repairing the damage to infrastructure and economic productivity that has devastated economic opportunities in many parts of the country and pushed some Nigerians towards militancy. However, efforts to improve military capacity or local infrastructure will take years, so the government will continue to look for shorter-term solutions. The solutions it is able to offer (including pay-offs, training or jobs for those renouncing violence) will be undermined by the authorities' difficult financial predicament. Furthermore, even if the government is able to direct more resources towards steering Nigerians away from militancy, this is only likely to encourage others to take up violence as a way to access official largesse.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
Institutional effectiveness will remain poor in Nigeria. The National Assembly is very slow at moving through new legislation, owing both to inefficiency and to tensions between the executive and legislative branches of government. With the APC largely a coalition of convenience, competing ideologies and priorities will continue to hinder the legislative process, as will tensions over how to handle Mr Buahri's ill health, policy direction and spending priorities between the federal government and powerful state governors. Finally, vested political interests, inefficiency and corruption have slowed reform in Nigeria for decades, and these issues are unlikely to change in the forecast period.
Corruption will prove impossible to tackle comprehensively
Nigeria traditionally boasts a relatively strong economic team, led by able technocrats generally in favour of structural reform. Mr Buhari and the APC have maintained this practice, given the need to bolster confidence among international investors and lenders. However, as always, the team's capacity to translate good intentions into action will be hampered by Nigeria's complex political environment, entrenched rent-seeking interest groups and weak administrative system. Despite some reforms of the civil service-including the removal of so-called ghost workers by the new administration-the public sector will remain overstaffed, highly bureaucratic and largely ineffective, given internal resistance to reform and a lack of desire among the leadership to upset deep-seated patronage networks and finely balanced factions within the APC. Although considerable progress has been made in strengthening institutional capacity to check more blatant forms of corruption, rent-seeking officials and politicians have found more subtle ways to defraud the Treasury, with continued corrosive effects on politics and economic management. Nigeria was ranked 136th out of 198 countries in Transparency International's 2016 Corruption Perceptions Index, and is expected to remain towards the bottom of the rankings throughout the forecast period.
Fighting corruption has long been a government priority-and is a key priority for Mr Buhari-but the administration's efforts are likely to yield limited results. In a nation where many members of the ruling elite, including politicians and senior military officers, display wealth that is beyond what could be acquired on their official salaries, structural deficiencies (including inadequate checks and balances) mean that graft will remain a problem despite the periodic headline-grabbing arrests. In addition, allegations of political score-settling are often levelled at the authorities in their anti-corruption efforts-something that will stoke acrimony and prevent greater co-operation across the political, legal and social spheres. Meanwhile, the judicial system is still deeply undermined by corruption and hugely underfunded. This has resulted in poor administration of justice, including long delays in the hearing of cases.
Political outlook: Election watch
The next national elections are due in 2019. The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC)-an awkward amalgamation of former opposition parties-will enter the next election period riven by factional in-fighting. We expect the party to remain just about intact for the elections, given that access to power is a strong unifying factor, but a split ahead of the polls is a distinct risk. An additional risk is that Mr Buhari will either decide not to stand for re-election given health concerns, or face an internal challenge for the APC's candidacy. Were Mr Buhari to leave office sooner, leaving Mr Osinbajo serving as president in 2019, there would also probably be a divisive struggle within the APC to agree on a single presidential candidate; Mr Osinbajo would not be the automatic choice, especially in the party's influential northern caucus.
The former ruling party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP), also suffers from serious internal ructions and will struggle to be a unified force in 2019. Nevertheless, the PDP still has strong grass-roots support and experienced campaigners. The outcome of the 2019 elections will therefore largely depend on which of the main parties can present the most united face, with a close result likely. Voters will probably be just about prepared to give Mr Buhari (or whoever replaces him) and the APC another term, given the relatively fresh memory of the largely ineffective period of PDP rule, but this is far from certain.
Political outlook: Key players to watch
Muhammadu Buhari
A former military head of state (1983-85), Mr Buhari subsequently made the transition into civilian politics. He had contested the civilian presidency unsuccessfully three times prior to his victory in March 2015. He is a founding member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), but has struggled to get on with some of the other big personalities in a governing coalition whose only single unifying objective was to win power. As a northern Muslim, Mr Buhari is not universally popular in the mainly Christian south of Nigeria, in particular in the key oil-producing region, the Niger Delta. There are major doubts over Mr Buhari's state of health, with the president spending much of early 2017 in the UK for unspecified medical treatment. A lack of clarity on his health has led to much local speculation that he could be forced to stand down.
Yemi Osinbajo
The vice-president hails from the commercial capital, Lagos, with his appointment giving geopolitical balance to Mr Buhari's northern power base. Since assuming office, Mr Osinbajo has taken a lead role in economic reform, including improving the business environment. In early 2017 he became acting president during Mr Buhari's medical leave, and an increased pace of economic reform in this period was notable. Were Mr Buhari forced to stand down before the next elections (due in 2019), Mr Osinbajo would serve the remainder of the term as president.
Bola Tinubu
A former Lagos state governor and founding member of the APC, Mr Tinubu is a powerful political figure in the south-west of Nigeria. His relationship with Mr Buhari will be key in deciding the effectiveness of the APC administration in the coming years. The two worked well together to secure victory in the 2015 elections, but since then the relationship has become strained. Mr Tinubu has made thinly veiled criticisms of Mr Buhari's management of fuel supply and has also clashed with Buhari loyalists within the APC over political appointments.
Babatunde Fashola
Another former Lagos state governor and APC member, Mr Fashola won plaudits both locally and internationally for his efforts to develop one of the world's largest and most chaotic cities. Given his successes in Lagos, he was appointed as power, works and housing minister by Mr Buhari. He is a potential vice-presidential or presidential candidate for the future, but will have to negotiate a fractious relationship with his one-time mentor, Mr Tinubu.
Olusegun Obasanjo
A former military ruler (1976-79) before being elected president (1999-2007), Mr Obasanjo's relationship with the former ruling party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP), broke down prior to the 2015 elections, culminating in his leaving the party. He has since adopted the approach of an elder statesman, vocal on issues such as governance. Although his impact in day-to-day politics is waning, he will remain influential behind the scenes.
Goodluck Jonathan
Mr Jonathan was the defeated incumbent in the 2015 presidential elections. He was the first person from the Niger Delta to lead the country. His time in office yielded little in the way of progress on many of the challenges faced by Nigeria, but he will be favourably remembered for his gracious acceptance of electoral defeat-something that significantly reduced post-electoral tensions. Although no longer in power, Mr Jonathan is still very active within the PDP as it suffers from major ructions in the wake of its ejection from power. He could yet return to frontline politics.
Lamido Sanusi
Mr Sanusi was a respected governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria before he was dismissed by Mr Jonathan because of a dispute over what Mr Sanusi claimed were billions of dollars of fraudulently missing oil revenue. Mr Sanusi subsequently became the emir of Kano (an important religious position), but remains vocal on political and economic matters. His criticism of the Buhari administration's foreign-exchange policy is likely to prevent any quick rapprochement with the political elite, however.
Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu
As the head of the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and junior petroleum minister (Mr Buhari named himself as the petroleum minister), Mr Kachikwu has the task of reforming Nigeria's moribund oil sector. He has shown reforming zeal so far, attempting to push through major changes to the functioning of the NNPC. However, he faces a massive task given the scale of the issues faced and strong vested interests in maintaining a corruption-blighted status quo.
Kemi Adeosun
The finance minister is a former finance commissioner of Ogun state who also has private-sector experience, at PricewaterhouseCoopers and Chapel Hill Denham, a local investment bank. Although well qualified for her current post, she does not have a particularly high profile or a significant support base.
Political outlook: International relations
Many of Nigeria's militant groups operate across borders, and international co-operation will therefore be needed to tackle the threat they pose. Stretched resources, vast territories and porous borders will prevent complete military victories, but regional co-operation will improve. The West will provide some assistance, but will remain wary given concerns over human rights abuses perpetrated by the Nigerian armed forces. Relations with the US will be mixed; the Trump administration has appeared more willing than its predecessor to sell Nigeria military hardware, but the US's clampdown on immigration has ensnared some Nigerians (even though they are not on the travel ban list of countries drawn up by the Trump administration), straining bilateral relations.
India will remain important as the largest market for Nigerian oil (although demand from the US has started to rise again after slumping in 2014-15 amid the shale oil boom) and will become a bigger source of foreign investment. However, this will come as weakening Chinese domestic prospects limit Chinese appetite for large-scale involvement in Nigeria's challenging business environment.
Nigeria will remain an important player on the Sub-Saharan African stage given its size, but its domestic challenges will tend to keep policymakers inwardly focused. Relations with South Africa, meanwhile, will remain strained. Africa's two largest economies will continue to compete for political, economic and cultural influence.

Nigeria will have a population of well over 200m in 2021, ensuring that it will remain by far the most populous nation in Africa; it accounts for almost half of the population of the West Africa region and around 20% of the Sub-Saharan region. Nigeria has a very young population, with over 40% under 15 years of age and almost 2m entering the jobs market each year.
Underemployment is more of an issue than unemployment
The population growth rate will be high enough to retain a relatively stable age profile. Such a youthful population will have difficulty in finding suitable employment within the formal economy. However, it is not unemployment that is the main issue; few Nigerians in the labour force can afford not to work in a country with no government social security support for the unemployed. Instead, the main challenges are underemployment and low pay. This suggests that the task facing the government is not so much job creation as the implementation of reforms to help to raise productivity and enable employers and employees to upskill existing jobs. Indeed, the country's ability to capitalise on this demographic opportunity will depend on raising health, employment and educational standards, on which only gradual progress can be expected. With the participation rate increasing gradually, largely as a result of more women entering the workforce, the pressure on the job market will be keenly felt throughout the forecast period.
Much will depend on the manufacturing and services sectors, but the prospects are mixed. Meanwhile, the oil and gas sector will remain capital- rather than labour-intensive, and a gradual switch from subsistence to commercial farming is likely to result in less employment in agriculture rather than more, as hoped by the government. Many young Nigerians will have to resort to low-paid work in the informal sector, but others are likely to turn to crime or militancy-another challenge for policymakers.
Rapid urbanisation will present a challenge
A further problem will be to provide enough housing for young Nigerians leaving home. Given that the government's efforts to boost house-building are expected to make only limited progress, owing to inefficiency and capacity bottlenecks, slums are likely to increase in number and resentment to grow. This issue will be intensified by ongoing urbanisation. The share of the urban population will surpass 50% in the forecast period, up from 36% in the 1991 census. This will strain the capacity of municipal authorities to provide adequate services. Nevertheless, competition for the best agricultural and grazing grounds will continue in some parts of the country. Access to land has been a key source of violence in the country's "middle belt", and this is set to continue.
Weak infrastructure compounds health challenges
Although the reported incidence of HIV/AIDS is relatively low in Nigeria, with UNAIDS putting the prevalence rate in 2015 at 3.1%, the country's large population means that Nigeria has one of the highest numbers of sufferers of the disease in the world. Furthermore, there are geographical pockets of infection where the level is above 20% of the sexually active population, and there are major differences in the prevalence rate between states. Other health concerns include the high incidence of malaria, tuberculosis and Guinea worm disease. Furthermore, there was a significant outbreak of measles during 2016 across parts of northern Nigeria that have seen local health infrastructure decimated by insecurity. A mass vaccination programme began in early 2017, but it will take time to bring the outbreak under control. More positively, the measles vaccination push has been able to leverage some of the networks built by a big push in recent years to eradicate polio. In mid-2015 Nigeria celebrated one year without a case of polio, prompting the World Health Organisation to remove the country from the handful of endemic countries in September of the same year. However, a few isolated cases were reported during mid-2016, showing that the fight is not yet over-especially as insecurity will remain a persistent threat where these diseases are most prevalent. Meanwhile, in other, more prosperous areas of the country, diseases associated with improving living standards are also a growing issue; for example, 1.56m Nigerians suffer from diabetes-a figure that looks likely to increase, given weak healthcare provision.

Nigeria's business environment will remain among the more challenging in the world over the next five years. Small improvements in the political environment, economy and infrastructure will be largely offset by ongoing major deficiencies in the authorities' handling of the foreign-exchange markets and a more complex tax regime. This mixed picture, coupled with other countries moving ahead at a faster rate with their own business environment reform processes, will mean that in our global rankings Nigeria falls from 73rd to 78th place out of 82 countries. In the regional rankings Nigeria deteriorates from 12th to 15th out of 17 countries.
Efforts to create a significantly more attractive business environment in the country will continue to be hindered by the slow pace of market-oriented structural reforms, the ongoing problem of corruption, the absence of effective government institutions, the weak capacity of the civil service to implement changes and extremely poor infrastructure. It will remain largely beyond the capacity of Nigeria's policymakers, even in the medium term, to push through the much-needed and comprehensive reforms.
Efforts to diversify economy away from oil will require pro-business reforms
While Nigeria will emerge from the economic recession of 2016 during the forecast period, prices for its economic mainstay, oil, will remain well below the peaks seen in the early 2010s. This will place ongoing strain on the economy. However, there is good to come from this, as it will force the administration to do more to improve the business environment for the non-oil sector. Furthermore, with the oil-revenue-dependent government unable to afford a sustained large-scale public spending spree to try to boost growth, it will instead edge towards sanctioning the greater role of private companies in the provision of public services, including health, education and infrastructure building, although the benefits of this will only be felt after the end of the forecast period.
Business environment outlook: Nigeria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Progress on market-oriented reforms is positive but slow moving, given various vested interests and inefficiencies.
2019-21: The administration formed after the 2019 elections makes more assertive steps towards improving the environment for the non-oil private sector, although the reform process remains beset by inefficiency.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Confusion over oil sector reform creates ongoing uncertainty for investors. The government favours local companies in oil sector deals.
2019-21: Clearer policy lines help to stem the trend of lower investment in the oil and gas sectors, but low prices prevent any major upturn in foreign direct investment. Meanwhile, liberalisation opens up greater non-oil opportunities.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Ongoing restrictions on end-users of hard currency mean that a large premium between the official and black- market rates persists.
2019-21: Political upheaval around the 2019 elections and ongoing nationalistic sentiment delays reforms to make trading across borders easier.
Taxes
2017-18: Focus on boosting tax compliance grows, especially given weak prospects for oil revenue. Retroactive measures become a possibility, although the business community will fight this.
2019-21: Tax rates for the oil and gas sector increase under new legislation. Efforts to increase VAT and move more of the informal economy into the formal sector see non-oil collection also improve.
Financing
2017-18: Risk premiums on Nigerian foreign borrowing increase in line with difficult economic prospects, while the weak health of the domestic banking sector (given connections to the troubled oil industry) restricts local availability of financing.
2019-21: Funding for well-planned projects becomes easier to raise domestically once the 2019 elections are concluded, as local capital markets deepen and the banking sector develops.
The labour market
2017-18: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers and poor health indicators among the workforce.
2019-21: Employers continue to struggle to find suitably qualified staff.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Government spending on the priority area of infrastructure hits capacity constraints. Although there should be growth in private-sector investment, the government struggles to create an encouraging environment.
2019-21: Expenditure on infrastructure increases, but project implementation is slow and beset by corruption.

The economy will perform less badly than in 2016, but not by much
Nigeria's macroeconomic environment will improve a little in the forecast period, which translates to improvements in the score and rankings. However, this mainly results from the low base for comparison set by the economy's disastrous performance in 2016, when it lurched into recession and the currency's dollar peg broke. A return to (low) economic growth from 2017 and a slightly less volatile currency will provide some respite for the macroeconomic environment, but that is a long way from saying that Nigeria has a strong economy. Indeed, its position for this category, while improving considerably, is still only in the middle of the global and regional rankings. Although this category remains the country's highest-scoring by some margin, this mainly reflects how poorly the country scores in other categories.
Nigeria's macroeconomic environment will remain constrained by insecure property rights, a weak civil service, confusion caused by overlaps and contradictions between local, state and federal government actions, and deeply entrenched vested interests opposed to free-market competition. Macro-economic policy will continue to espouse the promotion of market-led growth and poverty reduction, but action is unlikely to match rhetoric.

Positive (but only limited) progress on structural reform results in a small improvement in the score but a deterioration in the rankings as other countries improve more quickly. Furthermore, this improvement is from a low base and the local business environment will remain difficult, with Nigeria towards the bottom of the global and regional rankings. The government will continue to send out mixed signals regarding its commitment to promoting a more market-oriented and competitive economy, protecting property rights and reducing government interference in the economy. During his time as military leader in the 1980s, Mr Buhari demonstrated a penchant for heavy state intervention at the expense of private-sector endeavour, and his policy statements while in power since 2015 imply that he still sees a large role for the state. However, he has included pro-business reformers with private-sector experience in his cabinet.
Despite the rhetoric of the government's Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), which was released in early 2017, it is highly unlikely that Nigeria will embark on major market-oriented structural reforms during the forecast period. The ERGP offers a vision of an economy that is largely private-sector-driven, recognising the power of free markets. However, vested interests will hinder such an agenda, including politicians wanting to protect patronage networks across geopolitical faultlines, consumers used to price controls and large subsidies, and, in particular, powerful business interests.
Given the small number of politically connected companies operating in many formal sectors-and the existing barriers to entry into many sectors-competition is expected to remain limited. Companies in the formal sector have been dependent on state subsidies and have been shielded by protectionist policies for so long that many are unlikely to respond favourably to government implementation of fundamental free-market reforms and will continue to champion state intervention, both openly and discreetly, particularly with regard to foreign trade and domestic infrastructure subsidies.
A rapid improvement in the ease of doing business is unlikely
An official goal of achieving a top-100 ranking in the World Bank's Doing Business index in the next three years (from 169th in 2016) is unlikely to be met. It is positive that Mr Buhari recognises the need to improve the business environment, and he was relatively quick to set up a Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) on coming to power. The reformist vice-president, Yemi Osinbajo, chairs the PEBEC and has instigated some positive reforms aimed at reducing red tape. However, a rapid improvement in the business environment will almost certainly require deeper reforms than have so far been announced. Although eliminating unnecessary bureaucratic constraints is vital to reducing the high cost of doing business, increasing private investment also requires changes in policy direction, including liberalisation of the foreign-exchange system. However, there is still strong opposition to liberalisation in general, not least from Mr Buhari himself, and this will get in the way of reform efforts.

Little change is expected in the government's policy towards foreign investment over the forecast period, as evidenced by the unchanged score for this section. With other countries showing improvement, Nigeria's position will deteriorate closer to the bottom of both the global and regional rankings. A lower oil price environment compared with previous boom years will limit investor interest in that sector, and despite government efforts to drum up higher levels of non-oil investment, this will be limited by the complexities of the local business environment, along with the bureaucracy, corruption, low productivity, poor infrastructure and low income levels that restrict the potential market. Ongoing foreign-exchange restrictions will remain an off-putting factor for investors.
As well as the weaker price environment, inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) into the hydrocarbons sector will also remain constrained until the regulatory and tax environments become clearer. The Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) was designed to do this; it was first submitted to the National Assembly in 2008 and presented again in a modified form in 2012, but got bogged down in the legislature. The Buhari administration is expected to push for the passage of the PIB, but it will continue to face resistance given the conflicting demands of the various stake-holders. These include ethnic nationalists demanding a greater share of oil revenue for impoverished communities in oil-producing areas (so-called host communities); federal officials wanting to maximise Nigeria's share of oil profits; and multinational oil companies seeking to hold on to their profits, while also demanding improvement in the local operating environment. Indeed, even assuming that the PIB is passed during the forecast period, its fiscal terms may well be at a level that continues to put off investors, given that we expect oil prices to remain well below recent historical levels. Given all of this, it is difficult to envisage any rapid improvement in the investment environment in the hydrocarbons sector.
Public mistrust of foreign investment will remain high
While outright expropriation of foreign-owned assets is unlikely, legal disputes and accusations of corruption can easily ensnare investors. For example, in early 2017 the Nigerian high court ordered Royal Dutch Shell (UK/Netherlands) and Eni (Italy) to temporarily cede control of a jointly owned oil licence to the federal government, pending an investigation into claims that bribes were paid in an earlier sale of the block. Controversy such as this highlights the problems of opacity and cronyism that have long under-mined public confidence in the government's management of Nigeria's mineral resources and fuelled local resentment towards foreign participation in the local economy.
Nigeria will attract a greater share of FDI into non-oil industries. Investors will be pulled in by the economy's strong growth potential and expanding middle class, which are driving growth in consumer markets in Africa's most populous nation. Mining, agriculture, retail, communications and infrastructure will all be growing recipients of FDI in the forecast period, albeit from a very low base.

Nigeria will remain one of the worst-ranked countries for foreign trade and exchange controls during the forecast period. We expect the administration to continue to struggle with the management of the foreign-exchange system in an economy prone to fluctuations in supplies of hard currencies, largely owing to reliance on volatile crude oil sales. This has seen the Buhari administration oversee the implementation of a number of capital controls aimed at supporting a dollar peg in a low oil price environment. The result has been a multiple exchange-rate environment that further complicates the already challenging business environment. While we expect some devaluation of the naira to be allowed over the forecast period, ongoing attempts to manage the currency's value will prevent the naira from reaching market-clearing levels, and a large premium with black market rates will persist.
Protectionist sentiments will persist
Protectionist sentiment will remain strong in Nigeria, and it is unlikely that the Buhari administration will have either the political will or the ideological orientation to promote free trade. It will take a long time to remove the barriers to the movement of capital, labour and goods, both within the West Africa region and between the region and its international markets. Crossborder smuggling is likely to remain an important feature of the Nigerian economy and to exert additional pressure on locally based businesses.
Although Nigeria's complicated tariff structure has been simplified over the past decade, the scope and range of import restrictions will also change according to the policy priorities of the government and the relative strength of local interest groups. The authorities will persist with varying bans on access to foreign exchange for the import of goods they deem non-essential, or will try to foster local production.
The capacity and efficiency of Nigerian ports have improved following the implementation of an ambitious concession programme in the mid-2000s that transferred management of terminals to private operators. However, although the reforms have improved port operations and ship turnaround times, there remains the problem of corruption in the customs service, which can complicate and delay the clearance of goods.

The government will attempt to increase tax rates and broaden the coverage of collection during the forecast period; an expected increase in the rate of value-added tax (VAT) in particular sees the score for this category worsen for 2017-21 and Nigeria's global and regional rankings deteriorate. The need to increase tax collection has been intensified by the slump in oil prices in recent years that slashed revenue for a sector that historically provided around 70% of Nigeria's fiscal revenue. However, while the tax burden is set to increase, it will be from a low base. With the total tax-to-GDP ratio at only 6% across all tiers of government, Nigeria has one of the lowest tax intakes in the world.
Increasing tax compliance will get the government only so far
The government has embarked upon a data-gathering programme that will enable it to pursue tax avoiders more aggressively, both at home and abroad. It also intends to boost tax revenue and compliance through an asset and income declaration scheme. Although there is plenty of scope to improve tax collection in a country where tax evasion is rampant, it is highly doubtful whether administrative measures to boost compliance and broaden the tax base will be sufficient to restore government finances. Tax rises will be needed at some point, but are not on the agenda in the near term given already high public dissatis-faction with the government. Indeed, the government has indicated that it does not intend to raise tax rates within the next 18 months, but thereafter is likely to increase VAT and consider changes to corporation and personal income taxes.
Many companies would be able to absorb moderate tax rises as long as they were accompanied by major improvements in the whole tax payment system. Companies in the formal sector complain of being subjected to multiple taxes as a result of tax authorities at the different tiers of government imposing a variety of levies, sometimes illegally. The fiscal rivalry between federal and subnational administrations makes it difficult for the central government to establish any new tax body with significant autonomy and the power to impose tax harmonisation. The efficacy of tax administration varies considerably by state. It is most sophisticated in the commercial capital, Lagos.

Nigeria's banking sector will continue to face a number of severe challenges, with the score for this category unchanged as a result. The lack of any improve-ment sees Nigeria's ranking for financing deteriorate on a global and regional basis. The country's recession of 2016 (and prospects for only a weak recovery) and banks' large exposure to the depressed oil and power sectors will continue to challenge banks' financial soundness. Non-performing loans grew past 10% of total loans during 2016 and seem likely to remain high in the coming years as the oil sector continues to underperform and the wider economy posts weak growth. A weakening exchange rate adds to this gloomy picture. Lending denominated in dollars accounts for almost half of banks' loan books, and lending to the oil and gas sector makes up around one-third of gross loans.
Some improvements to the financial sector are in prospect, but not many
Although the restructuring of the banking sector that took place after a major crisis in 2009 means that Nigerian banks are better placed to develop the domestic financial sector further, large challenges remain in raising standards to international levels, and crossborder supervision needs improving. Bank lending to private businesses-especially small and medium-sized firms-has been subdued in a high interest-rate environment. Nevertheless, as the forecast period progresses, greater competition in the banking sector should drive down the cost of banking and improve the availability of lending in the longer term, especially for corporate clients. Moreover, the government's efforts to create a long-term government bond market may allow the development of a more active corporate bond market in the future. Coupled with the development of the Nigerian Stock Exchange, this should make it easier to raise funds as the forecast period progresses.

The government of Mr Buhari has made reducing unemployment and boosting job creation one of its top priorities, particularly with respect to youths. However, there is a notable risk that rather than attempting to make liberalising changes to the economy as a means to improve job creation, the administration will instead adopt a more nationalistic approach, attempting to boost local employment by restricting that of foreigners. This prospect sees the score for this category deteriorate slightly in the forecast period, with Nigeria's rankings suffering as a consequence.
Poor education system will continue to generate skills deficiency
The dire state of the education system, notably the vocational system and apprenticeship schemes, means that skilled manual labour-from bricklayers to mechanics and electricians-will remain in short supply. Poor education, health and transport mean that, in terms of unskilled labour, productivity levels are very low. Nigeria's university system will continue to churn out large numbers of graduates, with a bias towards the arts and social sciences, but the economy will still suffer from a large deficit of skilled personnel, particularly in the fields of science and technology, as well as business management. Expatriates will continue to find the procedure to secure work permits-and sometimes even simple entry visas-complex and costly.
More and more Nigerians, particularly the younger generation, are no longer reconciled to a life toiling in traditional occupations or earning poverty wages; they aspire to modern standards of living, but there are not enough of the jobs that would bring them to this level. The dilemma facing the authorities is that the supply of workers seeking decent jobs is likely to continue to outstrip demand. This imbalance has both economic and political conse-quences in a nation that is susceptible to sectarian conflicts, often fuelled by competition for scarce resources. This suggests that the priority of policymakers should be to foster an economic environment that encourages private invest-ment in activities that have the potential to improve the productive and employment capacity of the economy. However, given past precedents, there can be little confidence that this will actually happen. High unemployment is set to remain a worrying feature of the Nigerian economy, and could well become a source of greater social and political instability.
Productivity will remain below that of Nigeria's developing-world peers
Although labour law reform in 2005 weakened the capacity of the unions to organise political or sympathy strikes, the labour movement remains powerful, capable of organising paralysing national strikes. Partly as a result of union pressure, the government has been forced to increase the minimum wage significantly in recent years. Although such increases have been required to offset the rising cost of living over the past decade, and should not affect the more skilled jobs in much of the private sector, where pay is already above this level, it is a move likely to diminish any prospects of rapid growth in the formal sector for lower-skilled and labour-intensive sectors such as manufacturing. Furthermore, given deficiencies in infrastructure, as well as health and education provision, productivity in Nigeria will remain a long way below that in other developing-world countries.

Improving Nigeria's dire infrastructure is a central part of the government's policy agenda. Lower oil revenue will constrain investment, but increased public borrowing and greater private-sector involvement will lead to some improvement in infrastructure. These likely improvements explain the rise in Nigeria's score for infrastructure for 2017-21. However, given the scale of the problems and the fact that progress will not match rhetoric, Nigeria remains near the bottom of the rankings. Nigeria's poor infrastructure has been a major constraint on growth since the mid-1970s. Successive governments have failed to deliver on promises to improve and expand basic services in key areas such as power, water, telecommunications, healthcare and education. Gains will be made where the private sector becomes more involved, although significantly furthering private-sector investment in many sectors will require politically difficult changes, such as establishing pricing systems that adequately allow for profit.
Funding issues will be a major barrier to development
Official efforts to boost infrastructure spending will yield mixed results. The administration's Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) contains ambitious projects that would require substantial private-sector investments, which are unlikely to materialise without stronger reforms to inspire investor confidence. For example, the ERGP states that Nigeria needs to invest US$3trn in infrastructure over the next 30 years. This equates to US$100bn a year, which is around 25% of the nation's current GDP and several times its savings rate. Given that government revenue (across federal, state and local levels) accounts for less than 10% of GDP and public finances are likely to remain tight in the medium term, the quest for grand-scale infrastructure development is only feasible with large injections of private capital, much of it from overseas lenders and investors. However, past experience in Nigeria has shown that investors are reluctant to put money into businesses where the government controls prices and other market variables.
Energy policy is backwards
Nigeria will probably remain beset by inadequate power supply. A lack of private investment in the development of power infrastructure and the failure of privatised electricity companies to invest more in upgrading and expanding their deficient facilities are largely due to the government imposing energy price ceilings that do not allow for cost recovery. Similarly, the main reason that thermal power-generating stations have been hampered for years by shortages of gas supplies in a country with abundant natural gas reserves is that official gas prices for domestic power plants have been too low to entice oil companies to invest in developing the costly infrastructure needed to harness gas for domestic use. The ERGP has said that the gas pricing structure will be reviewed to recover all prudent costs as services improve, but govern-ment officials and investors will invariably have different views on what constitute prudent costs. Policymakers also seem to have got the relationship between pricing and service improvement backwards. To begin providing a better service, companies often need to generate more revenue to invest in the physical and human resources required to achieve the desired improvements.
It is difficult to see how the administration will attain its infrastructure objectives without first putting in place independent and flexible pricing systems that can gain the long-term confidence of profit-seeking investors. As it is, the government's current concept of cost-reflective pricing amounts to occasional price increases, which at the time of setting may be cost-reflective but soon become unviable in a high inflation environment. This arrangement not only fails to assure investors of the future profitability of their endeavour, but also often results in the government periodically implementing large price adjustments that invariably fuel public discontent and protests.
A recent revival in Nigeria's railways will prove short-lived unless greater private-sector participation is encouraged. After decades of decline in the network, the revival at the start of 2013 of the 1,126-km Lagos-Kano line, after a ten-year closure, marked the first significant result of multiple government plans aimed at improving rail transport. However, Nigeria's railway revival has not been fast or cheap. Indeed, in April 2017 Mr Buhari asked parliament for approval to borrow US$5.85bn from China to continue the modernisation of the nation's rail network. An additional issue is that while infrastructure funding from China has potential, precedent shows that the announcement of large Chinese funding lines does not match up to actual disbursements as projects become bogged down in Nigeria's difficult operating environment. The expected Chinese economic slowdown over the forecast period will be a further constraint on its outbound investment.
Mismanagement and corruption will hinder road development
Large amounts of public money will continue to be spent on improving Nigeria's road network, but around half of the national roads are still in poor condition, exacting a considerable toll on the economy. The government will need to address mismanagement and corruption in the handling of road projects. In addition, the cumbersome process under which funds are released for public works causes delay in the execution of contracts, particularly with respect to road maintenance.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
The government released its medium-term Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) in March 2017. The ERGP is mainly aimed at addressing the country's huge infrastructure deficit, attaining food security and promoting industrialisation driven by small and medium-sized enterprises. The programme also seeks to secure macroeconomic stability, create 15m jobs and increase real annual GDP growth to 7% by 2020. It offers a vision of an economy that is largely private-sector-driven, recognising the power of free markets. However, the professed preference for markets is not backed by commitments to scrap many of the existing policies and practices that clearly hinder unfettered exchange, including capital controls, energy pricing regulations and international trade restrictions. Indeed, despite the rhetoric, there is little in the ERGP's details to suggest that Nigeria's rulers are about to embark on market-oriented structural reforms.
Successive Nigerian governments since the restoration of civilian rule in 1999 have paid lip service to the idea of market reforms, but progress has been slow and we expect this to remain the case. State management of scarce resources enables politicians and other members of the political elite to direct the flow of these resources not only for personal gain but also to favour specific geo-ethnic and political constituencies. Policymakers also fear that market reforms will push up consumer prices, thereby stoking wider unrest at a time when the government is already struggling to maintain political stability. There is also opposition to reforms from members of the middle classes whose living standards are dependent on government-subsidised goods, such as petrol and electricity. Sections of the private sector that rely on state handouts and protectionist policies are also not keen on structural reforms. Policy development and implementation will also continue to suffer from a lack of co-ordination and poor relations between the various tiers of government.
The restructuring of the oil sector will also remain on the policy agenda but will move at a similarly slow pace to the ERGP. Many contentious issues have still to be resolved, including fiscal terms and revenue management. The oil companies, workers and local politicians (not to mention the various militant groups) will all pull in different directions. Nevertheless, some modest progress is likely given the important role that a stronger oil sector could play in supporting the wider economy.

The Buhari administration will attempt to continue its expansionary fiscal stance into 2017-18, in an attempt to drag Nigeria out of the recession it entered during 2016 and with the 2019 elections firmly in mind. However, expenditure growth will be hindered by capacity constraints and an inefficient bureaucracy. Indeed, as is now common, the budget for the 2017 calendar year had still not been passed into law by late April.
Revenue collection in 2017 will increase strongly in nominal terms as exchange-rate depreciation boosts the value of Nigeria's oil exports in local-currency terms. However, as a proportion of GDP, revenue will barely creep back past 3%, reflecting the narrow revenue base. Oil revenue will continue to grow in 2018 in line with stronger prices and moderate production gains. The non-oil tax take in 2017-18 will increase in tandem with the recovering non-oil economy and government efforts to widen the tax base, but will do so from a miniscule base, and oil will remain the dominant revenue source. Overall, we expect the budget deficit to come in a little below 2.5% of GDP in 2017-18.
We expect 2019 to be more challenging, given our forecast of stronger global headwinds, which will sap confidence. Spending will remain high around the elections (although it will be reined in a little afterwards), and revenue will be constrained by stagnating oil prices. We forecast that the fiscal deficit will increase to 2.8% of GDP in 2019 before edging down to 2.3% of GDP in 2021, amid a tentative global and local economic recovery.
Deficits in the range of 2-3% of GDP appear relatively low by emerging-market standards. However, given such low revenue collection in Nigeria, debt servicing will become more challenging in the coming years. Indeed, debt servicing is already equivalent to about one-third of federal government revenue. Without more action to widen the tax base the proportion will increase, raising questions over longer-term debt sustainability. Furthermore, the situation at state and local government level is similarly precarious.

Monetary policy will concentrate on attempts to support economic recovery while limiting inflation and supporting the flagging currency. However, this will yield contradictory pressures in the early part of the forecast period, with the private sector desperate for cheaper credit to spur growth, but inflation running high following currency devaluation in 2016 and 2017. On balance, interest rates will not move much, staying high as pressure on the naira continues and inflation remains high. The monetary situation should stabilise a little in 2018 as oil prices recover. However, with oil prices remaining well below their 2012-13 highs, interest rates will have to remain at around double-digit levels, under the assumption that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will return to its, and Mr Buhari's, preference for currency stability. Rates are likely to fall in 2019-20 as the global economy slows and the monetary authorities attempt to stimulate activity, with Nigeria following suit, before a small increase in 2021 as economic activity picks up.

Nigeria will post only a weak economic recovery in 2017 from the recession it experienced in 2016. Oil production will pick up a little following the massive disruption caused by militancy in 2016-Nigeria was exempted from a production cut by OPEC at the cartel's recent meetings. However, we expect that the government will be unable to secure a permanent end to rebel activity and that lower-level disruption will continue. Much of the non-oil sector will continue to be hindered by the central bank's monetary stance and ongoing interference in the exchange-rate system. Power provision should improve a little, in line with reduced disruption to feedstock from the oil and gas sector, although energy supplies will remain woefully insufficient overall. We therefore forecast that real GDP growth in 2017 will reach just 0.9%.
No significant rise in oil production is expected in the medium term, given the magnitude of the issues faced. Elsewhere in the economy, some pro-business policy reforms and a gradual improvement in infrastructure provision will support the non-oil sector. Overall, real GDP growth should pick up to 2.1% in 2018. We then expect growth to slip back to 1.7% in 2019, given election-related uncertainty, compounded by an expected recession in the US and an ongoing slowdown in China that will spook global markets and lead to a moderation in oil prices. We forecast a moderate rebound in growth, to 3.2%, in 2021 as local and global markets strengthen. The average growth rate of 2.1% in 2017-21 is weak for a country with a young and expanding population, and will hit living standards and job creation-issues that will feed back into threats to political and social stability.
Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Even amid a lower price environment compared with the boom years of the early 2010's, Nigeria's oil and gas sector will continue to be crucial to the prospects of the wider economy, dominating the export profile and accounting for the majority of government revenue. Nevertheless, despite the best intentions of reformists in government, oil production is unlikely to stage a rapid recovery following a slump in investment in recent years, amid policy uncertainty and rising militancy by local groups seeking greater control of oil revenue. This lack of investment means that in spite of the oil sector being a source of great financial windfall for Nigeria, the infrastructure that supports it is old and rickety.
Achieving a workable consensus among the various political and economic interest groups that depend on the oil industry will probably continue to confound policymakers. In 2008 the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), a complex piece of legislation to overhaul the oil sector radically, was unveiled. It included provisions to create a national oil company that is self-financing and profit-driven; to enshrine greater transparency and openness in the management of oil resources; to protect the environment; and to alter revenue-sharing. However, successive governments have failed to implement the legislation and will continue to struggle to do so. The ongoing failure to pass the PIB stems largely from the rival claims of the stakeholders who lobbied hard to push their interests, which invariably relate to the share-out of the gains from Nigeria's considerable oil and gas endowment. The multinational petroleum companies responsible for most of Nigeria's hydrocarbon output oppose the PIB's proposed increase in the government's take of oil profits, claiming that it would deter investment in the industry. However, Nigerian officials and civil groups have long complained that their nation has been under-rewarded for its oil production, particularly from offshore deposits. With global oil prices now substantially lower than they were when the PIB was initially brought before parliament, the government is under even greater pressure to maximise its share of oil profits.
The PIB contains a provision for 10% of the net profit of upstream oil firms to be paid into a fund for the development of oil-producing areas. This would go some way to placating the oil-region militants. However, politicians from non-oil states, especially in the north, oppose this provision. Opponents argue that increasing the slice of oil revenue allocated to oil-producing states, which are already entitled to a 13% oil-derivation payment, will disadvantage non-oil parts of the country by reducing the amount of federal revenue available for them. Some of these areas are as needy (if not more so) and susceptible to political instability as is the oil-producing Niger Delta, they argue.

Delay in key legislation deters billions of dollars of investment
The uncertainty that continues to be generated by the delay in enacting new petroleum industry legislation has led to the loss or deferment of billions of dollars of investment, as prospective investors are unsure what fiscal terms and regulatory conditions will be in force if or when the law is changed. The good news is that the current administration has taken steps to address the issue of government underfunding in the joint-venture oil companies (in which it holds an average stake of 57.5%). It has agreed to pay US$5.1bn of the US$6.8bn it owes in cash call payments for the five years up to December 2015 in the form of incremental oil production-something that will go some way towards narrowing the infrastructure deficit. It is unclear what will happen to the balance and the arrears accumulated in 2016. From January 2017 the admini-stration has also stopped making budgetary allocations for cash call payments and instead allowed the joint-venture operators to deduct the share of production costs payable by the state at source before handing the government its share of profits. This will help to avoid future arrears, but at the cost of lower oil revenue for the government.
Gas production could be scaled up if pricing issues are resolved
Nigeria's proven gas reserves, both oil- and non-oil-associated, are among the largest in the world. In the gas sector the key issue is still flaring; a succession of deadlines to end the practice has been missed in recent years. There is therefore intense competition to find commercial outlets for gas. The government hopes to use much of the new gas production coming on stream to fuel domestic power stations, thus easing the electricity crisis. However, pricing remains an issue, as, despite government pledges to increase the price that it pays for gas, prices on the export market remain more attractive for companies in the sector.

The effects of currency devaluation and efforts by the authorities to rein in the subsidy bill and boost power tariffs to cost-reflective levels will see inflation remain high in 2017, at an average rate of 17%. Currency stability will improve as 2017-18 progresses, but global commodity prices will pick up and so average inflation will ease only moderately, to 13.4% in 2018. Pre-election spending and a further drop in the naira on the back of weaker oil prices mean that inflationary pressures will stay high in 2019, with inflation averaging above 12%, before it falls back slightly in 2020-21, to an annual average of 10.8%, as tighter fiscal and monetary policy takes effect.

We expect misguided interference by the authorities to continue to undermine the functioning of foreign-exchange markets in Nigeria during the forecast period. Despite the interbank market being notionally liberalised in mid-2016, ad hoc restrictions to try to head off depreciatory pressure are likely to be implemented. Import bans will come and go, as will directed foreign-exchange allocations. The current multiple-exchange-rate environment that results from this will therefore continue. Investors will be loath to enter Nigeria amid such uncertainty.
Nevertheless, despite the CBN's reluctance to give up its management of the foreign-exchange markets, it is not in a position to maintain a hard peg, given pressure on external reserves and strong dollar demand. We therefore expect periods of questionable stability in the official rate punctuated by notable, but sporadic, devaluations. Overall, we forecast that the official, interbank, value of the naira will average N329:US$1 in 2017, down from N196.6:US$1 as recently as January 2016. Slightly stronger oil prices will give the CBN more firepower to intervene in 2018, but a slight moderation in oil prices accompanying global jitters on the back of a US slowdown, coupled with elections in Nigeria, will lead to larger falls in the naira during 2019. By end-2021 we expect the naira to be trading not far away from N500:US$1.

Forecasting the naira
For the purpose of The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecasts, the naira exchange rate is that of the official market. This rate is then used for all calculations where the local-currency value is converted into US dollars, a prime example being GDP. However, given the current exchange-rate regime, the official exchange rate is not a good measure of the rates at which most businesses and individuals in Nigeria can access hard currency. An alternative would be for us to use the black-market rate for the forecasts. However, although this might be more reflective of the situation on the ground, obtaining credible historical data is difficult and the rate varies significantly across Nigeria, which would make forecasting challenging. Another option would be to use the average bureau de change rate, which acts as a sort of semi-official rate in Nigeria, with operators licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria but operating outside the interbank market. However, here too central bank interference is a major issue, complicating data collection and forecasting. Therefore, for the time being we will continue to use the official rate, but with the caveat that this rate does not give a true reflection of the health of the local economy in dollar terms.

Although oil prices will post a moderate recovery in 2017-18, boosting exports, we expect Nigeria's current account to record only small surpluses, a stark contrast to the enormous surpluses witnessed during the last commodity boom. Oil production will remain prone to disruption, and there will be little short-term progress in terms of diversifying the country's hydrocarbons-dominated export base. Import growth will start to pick up from 2017, in line with subdued, albeit improving, economic prospects, and an ambitious government spending agenda, but the import bill in 2017 will still be more than 25% below the average value recorded in 2011-14, when the oil boom and stronger naira allowed a spending splurge. Trade-related services imports and profit repatriation will pick up in 2017-18, but-as with goods imports-will remain below the peaks seen during the last oil boom. Meanwhile, workers' remittances will remain an important source of hard currency. We then expect the current account to post a small deficit in 2019, equivalent to 0.4% of GDP, as the global slowdown negatively affects workers' remittances, before a modest improvement to a surplus of 0.4% of GDP in 2021 as oil prices increase slightly.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Nigeria
Stocks and flows
Flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) into Nigeria in 2016 totalled US$4.4bn. This was the first year-on-year increase in five years. However, despite this increase, FDI inflows remained weak in an historic context; inflows in 2016 were still less than half their peak level in 2011. As well as lower oil prices, one of the main reasons for lower foreign investment in Nigeria's oil sector is the continued uncertainty about the future fiscal terms for the industry resulting from the delay in the passage of the controversial Petroleum Industry Bill. The bill, which was initially submitted to parliament in 2008, remains stuck. The stock of FDI was an estimated US$95.9bn, or 23.6% of GDP, in 2016. However, this share of GDP was magnified by the fall in Nigeria's total US dollar GDP as the local currency plummeted in value.
Origin and distribution
Most FDI inflows into Nigeria are from the oil multinationals. There has been a modest surge in non-oil sector foreign investment in recent years, after it became clear that civilian democracy and macroeconomic stability had become established. Although much of the investment was by large multinational companies that were already operating in the country, South African companies strongly increased their presence, with Asian companies leading the next wave. However, the challenging market has seen some prominent withdrawals by South African firms, and the economic slowdown in China is also likely to have an impact on Asian inflows.
Determinants
The main factors attracting investment by oil firms are low production costs and high-quality crude oil, both of which offset economic problems and political instability. A number of gas projects have moved ahead, stimulated by abundant supplies, growing demand and the government's policy goal of eliminating gas flaring. So far, privatisation has been a stop-start process. However, the opening-up of the mobile-phone market has been a success. Otherwise, the main rationale for investment by multinationals is to establish a presence in Africa's largest market, which could be highly profitable despite the difficult operating environment.
Impact
The energy sector, which has received most foreign investment to date, provides the majority of government revenue and the vast majority of foreign-exchange earnings. However, it is also a capital-intensive sector with limited linkages to the rest of the economy and little effect on employment. One area in which FDI has had a high-profile impact is mobile-phone networks, led by MTN of South Africa. However, MTN fell foul of regulators over its failure to register SIM card users during 2015 and has had a large fine imposed. This is likely to make investors more wary.
Potential
With the largest economy and population in Africa, Nigeria is an important market, although the awkward business environment-characterised by impenetrable bureaucracy and idiosyncratic regulation-is likely to keep FDI inflows below potential. Established multinationals that have mastered operating in the complex and chaotic regulatory environment make substantial profits, despite the country's low income levels and the logistical difficulties caused by the almost non-existent infrastructure, which obliges companies to provide their own power and water supplies and to distribute goods on a road system that is in poor repair. The government will continue to promote Nigeria as a rewarding target for foreign investment, especially for the commercial exploitation of a range of minerals. The privatisation programme will have a relatively high profile over the next few years, but progress is likely to remain erratic. Parastatals are an important source of patronage, and privatisation faces considerable political opposition, as it is often associated with large-scale job losses. However, the failure of public enterprises to provide an adequate level of service, notably in the electricity and water sectors, and the success of the liberalisation of the telephone market make privatisation almost inevitable, even if this proves to be a protracted and convoluted process. There is considerable potential in the agricultural sector, especially in the production of food for domestic consumption.

Market potential is high, but the operating context will be unfavourable
With Africa's largest economy (or second largest, depending on the exchange rate) and highest population (the country accounts for 20% of the population of Sub-Saharan Africa), Nigeria will grow in importance as a market for many multinationals. Yet its attractiveness over the next five years should not be overstated. Extremely low income levels for the majority of the population will continue to mean that most people have little to spend on goods other than basic necessities. Furthermore, GDP per head in US dollar terms (at market exchange rates) will remain well below the peak reached in 2014 throughout the forecast period. This is due to the weaker context for the vital oil sector and expected further falls in the value of the currency, the naira. Never-theless, Nigeria's growing middle class and wealthy elite-the sizes of which dwarf those in most other African countries-will remain important markets. Nigeria is potentially a profitable market for multinational companies that know how to operate in its complex and chaotic regulatory environment and have over-come the logistical difficulties posed by the almost non-existent infrastructure, for example by providing their own (expensive) power and water supplies.
As the problems associated with working in Nigeria substantially push up the cost of operations, particularly given low productivity, competition from low-cost imports will remain an issue. Providing goods through imports may seem a more attractive option for many companies seeking to exploit the market. However, given the authorities' desire for control over the exchange rate, capital controls and import restrictions will continue to impede business operations.

There will be little shift in spending patterns amid economic hardship
Given the country's low level of income, consumer expenditure is dominated by the purchase of foodstuffs. Food, beverages and tobacco account for more than half of household expenditure. When spending on fuel, clothing and footwear is taken into account (and given that households also face emergency outlays, for example on healthcare), little disposable income is left for expenditure on other consumer goods, leisure or eating out. These trends will broadly continue into the forecast period. There will be some increase in spending on consumer goods, driven largely by the burgeoning middle class, but the poor will remain in the vast majority. The middle classes are almost exclusively located in urban areas, with a geographic concentration in the south-west of the country, around the commercial capital, Lagos.

Initial conditions: Although the oil sector of the economy accounts for less than 10% of GDP (and did so even before the end of the oil price boom), its performance has a major bearing on overall economic conditions given its domination of government and export revenue. Consequently, the lower price environment since late 2014 has severely weakened the local economy. The government's ability to spend what oil revenue it does still earn in a way that would benefit the majority of Nigerians is hugely constrained by the extremely weak civil service, high levels of corruption and the requirement that a large proportion of revenue be allocated to states, which are even less accountable than the federal government. Although there is more dynamism in certain parts of the non-oil private sector, such as trade, entertainment, banking and communications, a background of weak infrastructure and decades of under-investment in healthcare and education means that the initial conditions for the country to enter sustainable and diversified growth are poor.
Population changes bring opportunities, but also threats
Demographic trends: Despite the poor initial conditions, one factor in Nigeria's favour is its large and young population. However, most indicators of the health of the population are low, reflecting decades of underinvestment in healthcare facilities, which will take years to turn around even if the commitment is found. Increasing urbanisation will also put strain on service provision in the cities, as well as housing. An additional problem for the government is provision of education and training facilities for the rapidly growing population, as well as long-term employment opportunities. It is difficult to be optimistic about the outlook without a substantial improvement in economic governance and policy implementation. Over the time horizon to 2050, there is time to turn the situation around, but the precedent is not positive.
External conditions: There has been a structural shift in Nigeria's export markets in recent years, away from the US, which is steadily reducing its oil imports, and towards Asia, particularly India. Oil reserves will not be exhausted by 2050 but are likely to have peaked by then, which will present the additional challenge of finding external markets for the growing non-oil economy. The importance of Nigeria due to its size and influence on the African continent means that the international community will retain an interest in political developments in the country and will try to address the issues of insecurity, corruption and poverty, although Nigeria's oil and gas revenue means that any influence they have will be limited. Without a real commitment by the domestic leadership, Western countries will promote largely cosmetic changes rather than more fundamental reforms.
Institutions and policy trends: The real challenge for successive governments is to raise average incomes and living standards through a sustained period of economic reform and to deliver a real improvement in governance. However, the omens are not good. Nigeria remains one of the most corrupt and poorly governed countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, and given how engrained these problems are, they will be hard to resolve, even in a long-term timeframe. The gap between economic policy rhetoric and implementation will remain huge, and improvements will continue to be slow, given that the vast range of vested interests that benefit from the chaotic status quo remain opposed to change. In addition, policy formulation will continue to be hampered by the country's federal structure; even if a positive reform agenda is promoted at the national level, it is often not implemented or is openly contradicted at the state level.
Largely unsuccessful attempts to diversify economy will hinder prospects
Long-term performance: Nigeria's long-term economic performance will pick up during 2020-50, albeit at a slower pace in 2017-30 than in 2031-50, given the long-term nature of many of the challenges restricting the country's economic potential. Indeed, growth in real GDP per head will remain negative up until 2020, given the weak medium-term context. Although some non-oil sectors will perform well (agriculture has enormous potential, as do retail and communi-cations), others, such as manufacturing, are likely to struggle to become internationally competitive. Income levels will remain low. Moreover, Nigeria's exports and government revenue will continue to be dominated by the hydrocarbons sector. Once the next wave of new developments in the offshore oil and gas sector has run its course, Nigeria will face difficult choices in terms of economic development, and it remains unclear whether fundamental policy decisions can be made and implemented to ensure that the country is able to enter a longer period of sustained and more diversified growth.

Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines ten separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, and infrastructure. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 16 (infrastructure), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2012-16) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2017-21). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2012-16. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2017-21 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
The main sources used in the business rankings model include CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce; Freedom House, Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties; Heritage Foundation, Index of Economic Freedom; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; UN, Human Development Report; US Social Security Administration, Social Security Programs Throughout the World; World Bank, World Development Report; World Development Indicators; Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Report.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2012-16 ranges are then used to derive 2017-21 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2017-21, not to the likely situation in 2021 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2014 or 2019). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text:   Country forecast overview: Highlights
The Economist Intelligence Unit assigns a high risk to the grand coalition government of the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) and the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) not serving its full parliamentary term to 2018, despite the coalition parties' recent renewal of their agreement.
Political risks have risen since mid-2015, as public unease about the influx of migrants and dissatisfaction with the mainstream ruling parties has boosted support for the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPÖ) and heightened intra-coalition tensions amid still weak economic growth. Since late 2015 opinion polls have shown support for the FPÖ at about 32%-above both coalition parties.
The risk of an early election increased on May 10th, when Reinhold Mitterlehner, the vice-chancellor, minister of the economy and leader of the ÖVP, announced that he would be resigning from all his positions. This is likely to mean that the popular 30-year-old foreign affairs minister, Sebastian Kurz, will take over as ÖVP leader and could lead to an early election later this year.
Even if the government survives the latest upheaval, we expect little progress in most areas of its reform agenda. This policy paralysis will hamper efforts to improve competitiveness, which over recent years has deteriorated relative to Austria's regional peers. We expect this to be the case under any new government as well.
The government budget is forecast to remain in deficit, albeit well within the EU-mandated limit of 3% of GDP, throughout the forecast period (2017-21) as the fiscal consolidation process suffers under limited government cohesion and effectiveness. However, we expect the public debt/GDP ratio to fall gradually.
Economic growth in recent years has been tepid, as productivity has weakened and export market shares have declined. Real GDP grew by 0.8% in 2015 but accelerated to 1.6% in 2016, driven by domestic consumption and invest-ment demand. We expect a slight acceleration of growth in 2017, to 1.7%, reflecting mainly catch-up growth, and forecast average annual growth of 1.5% in 2018-21.
Structural factors, including higher unit wage costs and more regulated markets, will keep inflation higher than in regional peers; after 1% in 2016, we forecast 2.1% inflation in 2017 and 2% on average in 2018-21.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 18 countries: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK.
Austria's business environment score improves slightly between the historical period (2012-16) and the forecast period (2017-21). As a result, the country rises to 11th place in the regional ranking and to 18th in the global ranking. Austria's strengths as a business location include decent infrastructure, stable institutions and co-operative labour relations, but high taxes, limited market opportunities and restrictive regulations will persist.
Country forecast overview: Austria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Government works on reducing red tape, but progress is likely to be limited. Barriers to entry to network industries are likely to persist.
2019-21: Modest strengthening of the competition authority's powers. Administrative reform reduces red tape. More transparency in antitrust proceedings. Risk of political interference in private firms in which state owns substantial stakes.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Foreign investment is generally welcome, but underlying opposition to takeovers of "national champions" persists.
2019-21: Possible erosion of barriers against foreign takeovers as a result of commercial pressure and EU legislation.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: No exchange controls. Foreign trade, governed by EU rules, should remain liberal, but further liberalisation unlikely.
2019-21: EU likely to accelerate shift towards bilateral free-trade agreements as multilateral trade negotiations stagnate.
Taxes
2017-18: No significant changes to the tax system, owing in part to government ineffectiveness.
2019-21: Some tax reform is likely if a government including the Freedom Party (FPÖ) takes power. Vested interests will continue to hamper large-scale reform and the high tax burden will remain.
Financing
2017-18: Financial stability to improve amid tighter regulatory requirements. Credit conditions ease gradually as banks' profitability recovers. Downside risks from financial, legislative and macroeconomic risks in central and eastern Europe.
2019-21: Introduction of systemic risk buffer of banks' risk-weighted assets. Further uptake in corporate bond issuance.
The labour market
2017-18: Economy-wide minimum wage is introduced. More stringent requirements for early retirement and invalidity pensions. Labour market slowly improves as increase in labour supply moderates and unemployment starts to drop.
2019-21: Continued expansion of labour supply, primarily via net immigration, but concerns about shortage of skilled employees in certain sectors are likely to persist. Early retirement phased out.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Further take-up of broadband services. Gradual improvement of transport links with eastern Europe.
2019-21: Improved transport network connecting main urban centres and providing better access to the country's interior. Gradual transition to low-carbon economy entails significant changes to electricity transmission infrastructure.

a Actual.
Background: Austria became an important force in central Europe with the formation of the Habsburg empire in the 15th century and remained so until the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the first world war. The Republic of Austria emerged in 1918. In 1938 Austria was incorporated into the German Third Reich. With the departure of the victorious Allied forces in 1955, it regained independence as a neutral country. In the post-war period Austria took great strides to catch up economically with the rest of the developed world and is now one of the most advanced nations. It is a member of the EU and a participant in the economic and monetary union (EMU).
Political structure: Austria is a federal republic and the head of state is the federal president. The government is led by the federal chancellor. The national parliament has two houses: the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house), of 62 members appointed by state parliaments, and the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house), which has 183 members elected by proportional representation. The last general election was held in 2013; the next is due in 2018.
Policy issues: The government's stated priorities are to reduce the budget deficit and debt pile, improve labour market participation rates, strengthen competitiveness, increase expenditure on research and development, continue to reform healthcare expenditure, stabilise the financial sector and raise educational standards. Progress on these issues will be modest at best, as tensions surrounding immigration, security and border controls will remain elevated across Europe, diverting attention to security and migration-related policy areas.
Taxation: According to the European Commission, Austrian labour tax as a percentage of GDP is the second-highest in the EU. A 2016 tax reform lowered the tax burden for low- and middle-income earners, but raised the top personal income tax rate from 50% to 55%. Social security contributions, shared between employers and employees, are high. Corporation tax is levied at a rate of 25%. Dividend and investment income is subject to a withholding tax of 27.5%. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a standard rate of 20%, and a reduced rate of 13% (raised from 10% in 2016) applies for certain goods and services.
Foreign trade: In 2016 the value of exported goods was US$142.8bn and the goods import bill was US$143bn. The services surplus, traditionally boosted by tourism receipts, was US$11.3bn. Along with a significant primary income deficit and modest secondary income deficit, this yielded a current-account surplus equivalent to 1.7% of GDP.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
The Economist Intelligence Unit assigns a high risk to the grand coalition government of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) calling an early election before the end of its term in October 2018.
The outlook for the coalition surviving seemed to improve slightly after the two parties presented a new coalition agreement in late January 2017, which included a number of policy measures, including a new minimum wage and enhanced security measures. However, relations between the two parties remain tense, and there are serious questions as to whether it will be possible for the coalition to implement the announced reforms. Furthermore, even within the parties relations are tense, as demonstrated on May 10th by Reinhold Mitterlehner announcing his resignation from the positions of vice-chancellor, minister for the economy and leader of the ÖVP, citing frustration within his own party. Mr Mitterlehner was seen as a placeholder for the popular 30-year-old foreign affairs minister, Sebastian Kurz, who is now likely to take over the leadership of the party. On the closing date for this report it remained unclear whether he would trigger an early election to capitalise on his popularity and win a personal mandate, or take up the offer from the SPÖ chancellor, Christian Kern, to work on a reform programme together until the scheduled election in 2018.
A clear trend in recent state elections and in the presidential election in 2016 has been gains for the opposition far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) at the expense of the SPÖ and the ÖVP. Opinion polls continue to show support for the FPÖ at about 32%, ahead of the SPÖ (at 29%) and the ÖVP (at 21%)-although when the same question is asked assuming that Mr Kurz leads the ÖVP, it becomes a three-horse race. The FPÖ is the well-established party of protest, attracting support from voters who are dissatisfied with the current government. It is therefore not surprising that support for the FPÖ has increased at a time when there is a widespread perception of stalemate within the current coalition, along with concerns about immigration, stagnant economic growth and relatively high unemployment. The fraying of the decades-long dominance of the political scene by the SPÖ and the ÖVP will weigh heavily on political stability in the years ahead. The FPÖ candidate eventually lost the presidential election in December 2016, and by a larger margin the second time round when it was rerun following irregularities in the vote counting process. However, the fact that the FPÖ candidate, Norbert Hofer, managed to gain almost half of the vote both times, and on a high turnout, backs our view that support for the FPÖ has become entrenched to a significant degree.
The FPÖ is likely to win an early election or the next scheduled one, and subsequently to attempt to form a government, although it remains unclear which party it will choose to do this with. Even if the FPÖ only manages to come second, the difficult relationship between the SPÖ and the ÖVP means that they are unlikely to enter another grand coalition. Thus the FPÖ is likely to form part of any new government, as the other parties-including the Greens and the liberal NEOS-are unlikely to be large enough to help any of the three large parties to reach a majority. The FPÖ's proximity to power means that it tends to moderate its views slightly compared with far-right, populist parties in other European countries, such as France and the Netherlands. Mr Kern has been vocal in his disapproval of the FPÖ, but has been moving towards the party in terms of policy, for instance by pushing for curbs on intra-EU labour migration and by stating that his own party and the FPÖ were the only parties in Austria that wanted change. Regardless of which coalition emerges, we expect political stability to deteriorate further in the second half of our forecast period (2017-21). Relations with fellow EU member states will worsen in the event that the FPÖ enters government, putting pressure on the FPÖ's coalition partner, and we expect a government led by the party to be unstable, as it would struggle to implement its policies.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
The next general election is scheduled for September or October 2018. Whether it takes place then or earlier, we forecast that the FPÖ will become either the largest or the second-largest party and will then probably form a coalition with either the SPÖ or the ÖVP.
Elections for some state parliaments are planned for the first half of 2018. The next election for the primarily ceremonial post of federal president is in 2023.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Austria was severely affected by the European migrant crisis, and this has been the dominant issue in its international relations since 2015. The country has been at the centre of many of the intra-EU spats regarding the bloc's response to the large influx of migrants, owing in part to its unilateral actions. Domestic pressure on the government to be seen as acting against this influx, and thus often against other EU member states, will remain high owing to the rise of the FPÖ, and it seems to have driven the government to lower its annual cap on asylum applications. The government has repeatedly hinted that it wants to limit labour migration within the EU, or at least give preferential treatment to Austrian citizens on the labour market, which will exacerbate tensions with many EU member states.
The rerun of the presidential election in December 2016 demonstrated the relatively broad support for EU membership. Many voters cited as one of their main reasons for voting for Alexander Van der Bellen-the independent candidate running against Mr Hofer-suggestions by Mr Hofer of a possible membership referendum in Austria if the EU does not reform or if Turkey joins. This experience should moderate any further attempts by the FPÖ to use the EU as a divisive issue.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
Alongside the 2016 tax reform, which provided about EUR5bn in tax relief to households, government policy has focused on challenges facing the country's financial sector. These have included the clean-up and debt restructuring of Heta Asset Resolution, a "bad bank" that was created to deal with the toxic assets of Hypo Group Alpe Adria (HGAA). The uncertainty surrounding Heta was removed in October 2016 when creditors accepted a debt-restructuring deal. The government has also had to manage the banking sector's exposure to central and east European economies.
In its renegotiation of its coalition agreement in January 2017 the coalition decided on a number of measures that it hoped to implement before the end of its term, in 2018. These include a new annual minimum wage of EUR21,000, as opposed to only sector-specific negotiated minimum wages, and reducing red tape for employers, including more flexible rules on working hours. However, we are sceptical that tangible progress will be achieved in most of these areas, owing to a lack of cohesion within the grand coalition and within the parties themselves at the different levels of government. The next government, which is likely to include the FPÖ, will move integration and immigration policy further to the right, but we would expect it to struggle to implement significant structural reforms rapidly.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
In 2014 Austria's fiscal accounts deteriorated, mainly reflecting the govern-ment's decision to create a bad bank to deal with HGAA's toxic assets. The fiscal deficit widened to the equivalent of 2.7% of GDP, from 1.3% in 2013, and public debt rose to 84.4% of GDP. Mainly in response to steady direct revenue growth, the deficit narrowed to 1% of GDP in 2015 but widened again in 2016, to 1.5%, owing in part to fiscally expansionary tax reforms and higher migrant-related public spending.
We expect the budget to remain in deficit throughout the forecast period, albeit within 1% of GDP from 2018, as fiscal con-solidation will continue to be limited and growth relatively slow. The public debt stock as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline gradually, from 84.6% in 2016, following a positive contribu-tion from the Heta deal, to about 77% in 2021. In the context of the quanti-tative easing (QE) undertaken by the European Central Bank (ECB) and Austria's relatively strong fundamentals, funding risks are extremely low in our view.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
Amid heightened political risk the euro zone economy is showing increasing momentum, and we expect another healthy expansion in the region's economy this year, after growth of 1.8% on average in 2015-16. Nonetheless, the ECB is continuing to pursue an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero, a series of so-called targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) aimed at pushing banks to lend more money and a EUR60bn per month quantitative easing (QE) programme, which will run until the end of 2017.
The ECB's president, Mario Draghi, stressed that the reduction in the pace of QE (from EUR80bn per month in March) was designed to sustain the bank's presence in the market for a longer period and should not be viewed as "tapering", which would signify a winding down of the programme. We expect tapering to begin in 2018, but downside risks to global growth during that year, including our forecast for an economic slowdown in China and tighter monetary policy in the US, suggest that the pace at which the ECB unwinds its accommodative policy stance will be gradual. We maintain our forecast that the ECB will not tighten policy rates before the end of our forecast period, in 2021.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Austria's initial recovery from the global financial crisis was respectable in the euro zone context, but subsequently the economy largely stalled and under-performed in comparison with regional peers, notably Germany, which was particularly striking given the traditionally high level of synchronisation between the two countries' business cycles. Real GDP rose by a sluggish 0.8% in 2015, and although it accelerated in 2016, to 1.6%, this remained below growth of 1.8% in Germany.
The economy's relatively lacklustre performance in recent years reflects a number of factors. Austria's domestic reform process has faltered and, along with higher inflation compared with its regional peers, this has weakened productivity and competitiveness, admittedly from fairly high levels, in relation to countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, hindering export performance. This has depressed labour market prospects. In recent years the labour market has not been able to integrate the increased labour supply, caused in part by the influx of migrants last year, and this has pushed up the unemployment rate, even though employment has been growing. This in turn has weighed on consumer sentiment, meaning that much of the windfall for consumers from low oil prices since late 2014 has been saved instead of consumed. Although inflation has picked up recently following increasing global energy prices and positive base effects, we expect continued moderate consumption growth owing to a modestly improving labour market.
We expect the current phase of catch-up growth-following an underperformance even compared with fundamentals in recent years-to continue, and we expect real GDP growth of 1.7% in 2017. This still compares negatively with, for instance, the Netherlands, where catch-up growth in recent years has been about 2%. The lack of reform progress is likely to continue to weigh on growth throughout the forecast period. Domestic demand will be the main driver of growth, which is likely to converge towards potential growth in the coming years. We therefore expect average real GDP growth of just 1.5% in 2018-21.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
Annual consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) has been subdued in recent years, but higher than in most other euro zone countries. Inflation averaged 0.8% in 2015 and 1% in 2016-well above average inflation in Germany and the euro zone in both years. This largely reflects structural domestic factors, such as higher unit wage costs, more regulated markets and a period of faster increases in taxes and duties. Rising services prices, energy price base effects and the lagged feedthrough of euro weakness via import costs fostered a gradual rise in inflation from October 2016, and will continue to do so in the rest of 2017, when we forecast full-year average inflation of 2.1%. We expect inflation to stay above the euro zone average in 2018-21, at 2% on average, as similar structural factors as in previous years persist.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
The euro has moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1 since mid-2015 and averaged US$1.11:EUR1 in 2016, with a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1, reflecting the sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following Donald Trump's election victory in the US. We now forecast an annual average rate of US$1.06:EUR1 in 2017 and US$1.07:EUR1 in 2018, reflecting heightened political risk in Europe and strong growth in the US, with the euro then appreciating gradually in 2019-21.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
Low oil prices and subdued domestic demand compressing import values helped the trade balance to move into surplus in 2014-15, from a deficit in 2009-13. The recent recovery has pushed up imports and pushed the trade balance back into a small deficit in 2016. We expect further growth and higher oil prices to continue to weigh on the trade balance in the coming years. However, this will be compensated for by a healthy surplus on the services balance, driven in large part by robust tourism inflows. We therefore expect continued current-account surpluses in our forecast period of just below 2% on average.

Full text:   Country forecast overview: Highlights
Since the failed coup by parts of the military on July 15th 2016 there has been a rapid deterioration in Turkey's political outlook, and it looks set to continue. The president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) are steadily tightening their grip on power. This process is undermining Turkey's already fragile democratic institutions and governance structures and exacerbating the already deep social and political polarisation of the country. The approval in a referendum on April 16th 2017 of a set of constitutional changes designed to replace Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidency with few checks and balances moves the country one step closer to one-man rule by Mr Erdogan.
The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast is that Mr Erdogan and the AKP will win the next presidential and parliamentary elections, completing the transfer of executive powers to Mr Erdogan. The elections are not due to be held until late 2019, but they could be called earlier-once the institutions and instruments of the new presidential system are in place-if Mr Erdogan decides to accelerate the transfer of executive powers to the presidency. Emergency rule, which was introduced following the failed coup, will continue to be used to silence government critics and disable the pro-Kurdish opposition. Emergency rule will remain in place until at least late July 2017, and probably beyond.
Turkey is vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and jihadi extremists affiliated with Islamic State (IS). Turkey risks be-coming mired in the Syrian conflict, following the deployment of Turkish troops to Syria to combat IS and to halt the territorial expansion by Syrian Kurds.
With the government preoccupied with domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges, we expect little progress on economic reforms to improve the business and investor climate. Fiscal policy will be loosened to try to boost the economy, but we expect it to remain relatively tight during the forecast period.
We expect the Central Bank of Turkey to tighten monetary policy further in the short to medium term in order to re-assert its independence from political pressure to lower interest rates, and at the same time to prevent a further depreciation of the lira amid expectations of higher US interest rates.
We expect real GDP growth to accelerate slightly, from 3% in 2016 to 3.2% in 2017 and a still moderate 3.6% annual average in 2018-21. The current-account deficit has narrowed, but will still be difficult to fund, especially if global liquidity is tightened.

Our business environment score for Turkey deteriorates slightly in the forecast period (2017-21), but the country's global ranking deteriorates by 12 places. There is now uncertainty regarding the future direction of economic policies. Turkey lags most central and east European countries for foreign direct investment. The main shortcomings are a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Privatisations are likely to be delayed amid the post-coup upheaval in the state institutions. Some companies, notably those with media holdings or ties with the Gulenist movement, remain subject to heavy-handed state intervention.
2019-21: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in a wide range of sectors, although the opening-up of the energy market makes progress.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2019-21: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in key sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Capital controls are not considered. There is a boost to trade following the lifting of Russian sanctions. Possible increase in protectionism under the new US administration.
2019-21: Customs union with the EU might be extended, but negotiations are likely to be protracted given the deterioration in Turkish-EU relations. More free-trade agreements might come into force with the EU's trading partners.
Taxes
2017-18: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make some progress. Tax rates are largely unchanged.
2019-21: A broader income tax base as exemptions and exceptions are reduced. Possible tax cuts and increased incentives.
Financing
2017-18: Monetary policy remains cautious amid concern about a possible deterioration in credit quality. The Central Bank of Turkey and commercial banks remain under political pressure to keep interest rates low.
2019-21: The banking system remains stable, despite some weaknesses. Heavy reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2017-18: Labour market remains rigid, with relatively high costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment. A 30% minimum-wage rise in 2016 could damage competitiveness. Obstacles to employing foreigners ease.
2019-21: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Progress, albeit slow, continues on investment plans in energy, transport and communications.
2019-21: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. The construction of major airport and urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Gaps and bottlenecks might, nevertheless, persist.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates. b Actual.
Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then, Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West, becoming a member of the Council of Europe (1949) and NATO (1952), and signing an association agreement with the then European Community (1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western/EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened under the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but the coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey has a unicameral parliamentary system of government with parliament elected for a four-year term. To win seats parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Under the AKP Turkey is moving towards a presidential system of government, which will come into effect by late 2019. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability is Turkey's biggest policy challenge. Fiscal policy has remained prudent, but large external financing needs and changing global liquidity conditions will require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy relatively tight to attract adequate capital inflows. The Kurdish problem, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is one of Turkey's most pressing political issues, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015 and there has been a resurgence in violence. The failed coup has highlighted long-standing institutional weaknesses, which allowed, with the AKP's consent until 2013, the secretive Gulenist movement to infiltrate the state. Further politicisation of the judiciary is likely after the coup attempt. Corruption and patronage remain widespread.
Taxation: The basic rate of corporation tax is 20%. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Tax reform to reduce evasion was one of the main elements of previous IMF reform programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2016 goods exports (fob) came to US$150bn and imports (fob) to US$191bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$40.8bn-a contraction from US$48.1bn in 2015. The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
Since the failed coup by parts of the military in July 2016 there has been a rapid deterioration in Turkey's political outlook, and this looks set to continue. The president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) are steadily tightening their grip on power. This is undermining Turkey's already fragile democratic institutions and governance structures and exacerbating the already deep social and political polarisation of the country. In a referendum on April 16th a set of constitutional changes designed to replace Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidency were approved. This moves the country one step closer to one-man rule by Mr Erdogan. The president will not be deterred by the narrow margin of victory in the referendum or allegations of vote fraud by individuals close to the "yes" camp. Given the control that Mr Erdogan and his ruling AKP have over Turkey's institutions, it is highly unlikely that bids to nullify the referendum result will succeed. The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast is that Mr Erdogan and the AKP will win the next presidential and parliamentary elections, completing the transfer of executive powers with few checks and balances to Mr Erdogan. These elections are not due to be held until 2019, but they could be called earlier, once the institutions and instruments of the new presidential system are in place, if Mr Erdogan decides to accelerate the transfer of executive powers to the presidency.
Given the close referendum result and the allegations of vote fraud we expect political instability to persist in Turkey, which is likely to delay further economic reform efforts, hamper economic recovery and damage the country's already fragile relations with the EU. Immediately after the referendum the government announced the extension for another three months, to late July 2017, of the state of emergency law that was introduced in response to the failed coup. Emergency rule allows the president and the cabinet to pass laws without the approval of parliament and without recourse to the Constitutional Court, effectively allowing Mr Erdogan to govern as a president with executive powers until the new system of government is in place. Emergency rule was initially introduced to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of a US-based Islamic cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who is accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. However, the use of these powers has been extended to eliminate the pro-Kurdish political opposition, which the government accuses of having links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). More than 100,000 people, mainly in the judiciary, the military, the police, academic institutions and the media, have so far been suspended, dismissed or detained.
Security risk will remain high, with negative implications for the economy. The state is seeking to end an insurgency by the PKK in the south-east of Turkey, address the domestic security risk posed by terrorist attacks by Kurdish militants and Islamic State (IS) in cities across the country, and implement military operations in Syria and Iraq against both IS and the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds. The purge of the Turkish armed forces and the police since the attempted coup has created operational capacity problems and contributed to intelligence failures that have exacerbated Turkey's domestic security issues. In the short to medium term neither the government nor the PKK appears to be interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will intensify.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
The next parliamentary and presidential elections will be held in early November 2019 at the latest. We expect Mr Erdogan to win the presidential election and to remain in office, with enhanced powers, for at least one more five-year term, if not two (the maximum allowed), up to 2029. His popularity is unrivalled, while the opposition is fragmented and lacks candidates capable of challenging him. In 2014 Mr Erdogan won the presidential election in the first round with just over 50% of the vote, well ahead of a joint candidate presented by the two main opposition parties, the Republican People's Party (CHP) and the Nationalist Action Party (MHP). The MHP's support in parliament for the AKP's presidential reform makes it unlikely that either of the two parties would consider fielding a joint candidate at the next election.
The clampdown on the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) since mid-2015, the MHP leadership's decision to back the presidential reform, and the hardline nationalist stance adopted by Mr Erdogan and the AKP could have a considerable effect on voting patterns at the next parliamentary election. Both the MHP and the HDP have been weakened since the 2015 elections and run the risk of falling below the high 10% national vote threshold for representation in parliament, which would help to boost the AKP's share of seats. As a result of the constitutional changes approved in the presidential reform referendum, there will be 600 seats in a much weakened parliament from the next election, up from 550 currently.
The next local elections are scheduled to take place by March 2019.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Since the failed coup Turkish foreign policy has been heavily conditioned by Mr Erdogan's domestic political goals, notably his push to establish a presidential system of government. This approach, combined with ongoing political upheaval in Europe and the US, Turkey's traditional Western allies, has resulted in a marked deterioration in Turkey's international relations.
Tensions with the EU escalated to new highs during the presidential reform referendum campaign and are unlikely to ease in the near future given Mr Erdogan's narrow win and allegations of vote fraud. Neither Turkey nor the EU is genuinely interested in Turkish membership of the bloc any more, but neither has yet been willing to suspend negotiations unilaterally. If Turkey reintroduces the death penalty, as Mr Erdogan has suggested since the failed coup, the EU might not be able to avoid suspending the process. Our baseline forecast has been that the death penalty is unlikely to be reinstated, but this cannot be ruled out given the government's increasingly hardline nationalist stance. The suspension of accession negotiations would almost certainly prompt Tukey to end its collaboration with the EU to stem the inflow of migrants and refugees into Europe. An agreement on a solution to end the de facto division of Cyprus between the Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north could help to improve Turkey's relations with the EU, but we believe that a settlement is unlikely during the forecast period (2017-21).
The Turkish government's expectations of a reset of ties with the US under the administration of the new US president, Donald Trump, have so far proven unrealistic, causing growing frustration in the Turkish government. Although Mr Trump's administration is less concerned about Mr Erdogan's autocratic tendencies than its Democrat predecessor was, Mr Trump is unlikely to do much to address the two issues that are of most concern to Turkey: its request for Mr Gulen to be extradited from the US to face trial in Turkey for his alleged responsibility for the failed coup; and an end to US support for the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), which is fighting IS in Syria and is affiliated with the PKK.
Since mid-2016 Turkey has improved its ties with Russia, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly in relation to the conflict in Syria, where both countries are militarily involved but are pursuing contrasting goals. We expect relations to remain largely transactional and the risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
We expect political instability and fluctuations in global liquidity as a result of anticipated shifts in US monetary policy to pose an ongoing risk to foreign capital inflows to Turkey, especially in the first half of the forecast period. These are predominantly portfolio investments and short-term loans needed to meet the country's large external financing requirements, so tend to be highly volatile. Faltering capital inflows since November 2016 have put the lira under intense pressure, fuelling inflation expectations and highlighting the need for the Central Bank of Turkey to tighten monetary policy after a prolonged period of loosening. An abrupt tightening of policy could strangle Turkey's already fragile economic growth.
The economy has shown considerable resilience during past bouts of volatility in global liquidity, owing largely to the country's solid public finances and well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector. However, Turkey's medium-term economic policy outlook remains a cause for concern. The AKP government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
Major upward revisions to Turkey's national accounts in December 2016 have helped to improve the country's budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios. The public finances are in good shape and our baseline forecast remains that fiscal policy will be kept relatively tight to maintain a low level of public debt, and to try to avoid fuelling another surge in domestic demand and a further expansion of the still large current-account deficit. Reflecting the impact of the economy's weakness and increased public spending since the failed coup, we expect the central government deficit to widen moderately, from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to an average of 1.9% of GDP per year in 2017-21. The government debt/GDP ratio is low, but it edged up slightly, to 29.4% in 2016, from 29.1% in 2015. We expect a further moderate increase in 2017-19, before it declines to about 30% in 2021. However, the risk of a larger deterioration in the public finances cannot be ruled out. The government's decision to transfer Turkey's major state assets to a sovereign wealth fund set up in 2016 to help to finance major infrastructure projects could bring to a halt the government's privatisation programme and increase political control over state companies, and the fund could become a vehicle for increased off-budget spending.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
We expect that in the coming months the central bank will have to tighten monetary policy further in order to re-assert its independence from political pressure to lower interest rates to revive economic activity, and at the same time to prevent a further depreciation of the lira amid expectations of higher US interest rates. We expect the bank to use a mix of interest-rate rises, macroprudential measures and other policies. Having steadily lowered interest rates in May-September 2016, the central bank has raised most of its main policy rates since November 2016 and has increasingly provided funding to the banking sector at its previously little-used "late liquidity window" overnight lending rate, which was raised by a total of 200 basis points, to 11.75%, in mid-March. Since November 2016 the weighted average cost of the central bank's funds to the banking system has risen from 7.8% to about 11.5% in the first half of April 2017.
The central bank is seeking gradually to normalise its monetary policy frame-work to establish a single policy interest rate, the one-week repurchase lending rate, which would help to improve transparency regarding monetary policy de-cisions. However, it is unlikely that the corridor will be eliminated until inflation is more firmly on a downward path towards its medium-term target of 5% and domestic political uncertainty eases. From 2017 the bank will hold only eight regular Monetary Policy Committee meetings annually rather than 12.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Domestic political instability, perceived security risks from terrorist attacks and uncertainty about the global economic outlook will have negative effects on the economy in the short and medium term. We expect real GDP growth to pick up only modestly, from 3% in 2016 to 3.2% in 2017. In 2018-21 we expect real GDP growth to average 3.6% per year, assuming that there is a gradual stabilisation of domestic conditions. By far the biggest risk to our growth forecast is the possibility of a severe disruption to capital inflows to Turkey.
We expect moderate private consumption growth in 2017-21 as domestic political uncertainty, a weaker lira and high unemployment will partially offset the impact of the 30% minimum wage rise in 2016, government pressure on banks to ease lending conditions for households and government incentives to support demand for certain household durable goods.
After expanding by 7.7% in 2016, we expect government spending to increase by just under 8% per year on average in 2017-19 as the government seeks to revive the economy and boost support ahead of the 2019 elections. From 2020 we expect more moderate-but still solid-growth.
The deterioration in the business environment since the attempted coup will continue to dampen fixed investment growth in 2017-18, as weakened business sentiment and a more cautious approach by foreign investors will offset government plans to invest heavily in infrastructure projects. In 2019-21 we forecast an acceleration to average annual growth of 4.9%, assuming a less volatile domestic and global environment.
After contracting by 1.9% in 2016 as a result of the impact of Russian sanctions and domestic security concerns, especially on the tourism sector, we expect exports of goods and services gradually to return to growth, reflecting the lifting of sanctions and the impact of a weaker lira on export competitiveness. However, we expect the perception of security risks to persist for some time, which will continue to deter visitors to Turkey. Our expectation is that a sharp slowdown in the Chinese economy in 2018 and a cyclical downturn in the US in 2019 will dampen external demand growth in those years.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
Consumer price inflation has remained stubbornly high-well above the official 5% medium-term target-as a weaker lira has, for the most part, offset the disinflationary effects of plunging global oil prices since mid-2014. We expect further currency weakness and a partial recovery in oil and other commodity prices from 2017 to keep consumer price inflation well above the official target during the first half of the forecast period. Assuming that the central bank tightens monetary policy and does not loosen it too soon, we see inflation gradually easing, achieving the 5% target by end-2021.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
The Turkish lira has been highly volatile and generally on a depreciating path against all major currencies since September 2016. Amid further bouts of volatility we expect the lira to depreciate against the US dollar to an annual average of TL3.73:US$1 in 2017, a fall of 19%. In 2018-21 we forecast that the exchange rate will remain broadly stable in real terms, depreciating in nominal terms to an average of TL4.07:US$1 in 2021. The lira will also depreciate sharply against the euro in 2017-21. There are substantial risks to our exchange-rate forecast, arising from uncertainty about the outlook for global financial flows, and the impact on investor confidence of domestic political instability and geopolitical turmoil in the region surrounding Turkey.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
GDP revisions, moderate domestic demand growth, sharply lower global oil prices and a weaker lira have helped to reduce Turkey's current-account deficit in recent years. However, we expect it to widen moderately and remain sufficiently large-at a forecast average of 5% of GDP per year in 2017-21-to make it difficult for Turkey to meet its external financing needs if global liquidity is constrained and the loss of investor confidence since the failed coup persists. Although a weaker lira will boost Turkey's main export sectors, we expect this to be largely offset by the higher cost of imported energy and inputs for manufactured import-intensive exports. In addition, the tourism sector is likely to take several years to recover to 2015 pre-crisis levels-before the resurgence of terrorist attacks and the imposition of Russian sanctions.

Full text:   Country forecast overview: Highlights
Donald Trump, the new US president, has expressed a desire to improve relations with Russia. However, the likelihood of a significant rapprochement has declined following a US strike on a Syrian airbase in early April.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects US and EU sectoral sanctions on the Russian defence, energy and financial sectors to remain in place in the medium term. Russian counter sanctions on Western food imports will also remain in place indefinitely.
Despite a reduction in fighting in Ukraine, we do not expect the Minsk II deal to lead to a comprehensive political settlement. Ukraine will not regain full control of its border with Russia.
Russia is likely to remain a mobilisation economy, characterised by high spending on the defence sector, a cautious approach to foreign investment in many sectors, protectionism and a large role for the state in the economy.
Formal political opposition to the regime will remain marginal. Vladimir Putin, the president, is likely to run again for president in March 2018 and win with a large majority in the first round. The principal concern for the authorities will be to maintain a high turnout in the absence of a meaningful contest.
The government is unlikely to implement disruptive market reforms. Minority stakes in some major state enterprises will be sold off. Chinese companies are likely to take a bigger role in the economy, including in the extractive sector.
Despite pressure to maintain defence and welfare spending, the government will cut public expenditure in 2017-19 to keep the budget deficit under control. The budget deficit will narrow to under 2% of GDP by 2019, from 3.5% of GDP in 2016.
The economy contracted by 0.2% in 2016. We have revised up our forecast for growth in 2017, and now project it will expand by 1.8%, supported by higher oil prices and improving consumer confidence. Investment will remain relatively weak, and public spending will be tightened further.
The medium-term growth outlook will be constrained by structural weaknesses, including a lack of competition, high state involvement in the economy, an ageing and declining workforce, and weak rule of law. We forecast average annual GDP growth of 1.7% per year in 2017-21.

Russia falls by two places in our regional ranking in the forecast period (2017-21), to 15th out of 16 countries. This reflects manifold institutional weaknesses, poor rule of law, high levels of corruption and extensive state involvement in the economy. It falls to 69th out of 82 countries in our global ranking.
Country forecast overview: Russia's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Privatisation plans will proceed slowly, despite the announcement in 2016 of a new privatisation drive.
2019-21: Overall state involvement in the economy remains high. Government interference in private companies remains arbitrary. Rent-seeking officials remain a burden on business. Protection of intellectual property rights may weaken.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: International sanctions and low energy prices discourage major new investment in the oil and gas sectors.
2019-21: The "pivot to the east" will lead to further moderate growth in investment from Asia.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Some US sanctions may be relaxed. Membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is effectively suspended. The Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) internal market is undermined by exemptions and weak enforcement.
2019-21: The difficulty of trading across borders continues to be a weakness. The Russian ban on Western agricultural imports is likely to remain in force.
Taxes
2017-18: The resources tax on gas and the tax on tobacco rise. The freeze on the tax on vodka is extended. Direct taxes on in-dividuals and value-added tax (VAT) will not be raised, and the government may issue VAT concessions to selected sectors.
2019-21: A progressive consumption tax may be introduced. Tax inspections remain a burden on business. The time that it takes to pay taxes approximates to international norms. There are some specific improvements in the corporate tax regime.
Financing
2017-18: International sanctions limit access to external capital markets, significantly raising the cost of financing.
2019-21: International financial integration proceeds slowly. The banking system remains weak and state dominated. The government maintains its commitment to bail out systemically important institutions.
The labour market
2017-18: Spending on education is cut further. The incidence of strikes increases slightly, although the labour movement remains weak.
2019-21: The indigenous labour force will steadily decline, however the impact will be offset in some sectors by continued substantial immigration from the Commonwealth of Independent States, much of it unskilled.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Budget constraints curb investment in infrastructure. Politically important projects are prioritised, but even here cuts are made. Russia struggles to obtain international funding for its infrastructure projects. Roads are starved of funding.
2019-21: It remains difficult to secure foreign finance. China provides only a limited alternative to Western funding.

a Actual. b Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: The transition to a market economy in the early 1990s was accompanied by a collapse in industrial production and a sharp drop in living standards. A contested privatisation process led to a highly concentrated ownership structure. Executive weakness and bureaucratic dysfunction contributed to a sharp decentralisation of power. After becoming president in 2000, Vladimir Putin sought to restore central control over the regions and tame independent corporate interests. Mr Putin presided over a period of strong economic growth in his first two terms. His re-election as president in 2012 has heralded the development of a more authoritarian domestic environment.
Political structure: Boris Yeltsin won the first democratic presidential election in June 1991 and was re-elected in July 1996. Repeated confrontations with the legislature culminated in the dissolution of parliament in September 1993 and a violent showdown the following month. The powers of the executive were greatly increased by a new constitution, adopted in 1993. Mr Putin was elected in March 2000 and re-elected for a second term in March 2004. Mr Putin's second term in office was characterised by increasing centralisation of the state. A loyal ally, Dmitry Medvedev, won the presidential election in March 2008 and took over in May of that year. Mr Putin returned to the presidency for a third term in May 2012. Following a constitutional change, his term will last six years, to 2018.
Policy issues: Mr Putin's third term as president has seen a greater emphasis on "conservative cultural values", anti-Westernism and great-power nationalism. The stand-off with the West is leading to a rollback of Russia's integration into the world economy. This is likely to strengthen further the state's role in the economy. Tit-for-tat sanctions have encouraged the government to focus on import substitution. The focus on curbing "foreign influence" on domestic politics is likely to endure, along with close controls on civil society, the internet and media.
Taxation: Reforms since 2000 have aimed to rationalise the tax system and cut the number of taxes and the corporate tax burden. Changes to the tax regime in January 2001 included the introduction of a flat rate of personal income tax of 13% and a simplification of the administration of social security contributions. In 2004 the basic rate of value-added tax (VAT) was reduced from 20% to 18% and a regional 5% sales tax was abolished. The corporate tax rate was cut from 24% to 20% at the beginning of 2009. The government has pledged not to raise personal or consumption taxes before 2018.
Foreign trade: Mainly because of high international oil prices, export revenue has soared since 2000. Import growth picked up over the same period as a result of rising real incomes and real rouble appreciation. Merchandise exports totalled just over US$280bn in 2016 and imports were just over US$190bn. Oil and gas account for over two-thirds of Russia's exports, with metals contributing around one-tenth.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
Vladimir Putin's third presidential term, which began in 2012, has seen a shift towards "conservative cultural values", a more authoritarian political culture and more overt anti­Westernism. This has been further consolidated by Russia's confrontation with the West over Ukraine. Despite some pro-market rhetoric, economic policy has grown more statist and protectionist. The leadership is preoccupied by the need to insulate the economy and society from foreign-in particular Western-influence and the perceived threat of externally sponsored regime change. However, the regime is characterised by ideological flexibility and is more adaptable than many observers acknowledge. If the external environment allows (a major caveat), it is possible that the leadership will devote greater attention to domestic issues and welfare after the 2018 presidential election and attempt to implement a more liberal economic agenda. Concern about political stability is likely to hold the government back from pursuing radical reform.
The forecast period (2017-21) is likely to be characterised by relatively slow growth in living standards, following a major decline in 2015-16, and further cuts in public expenditure in many areas. This contrasts sharply with the rapid growth achieved in Mr Putin's first decade in power and could have unpredict-able effects on stability in the medium term. However, there currently seems to be little desire for disruptive reform among the broader population, and the potential for mass protest or major political change from below appears to be low. Social controls have been tightened since 2012, and the opposition has been marginalised and demoralised. Protests regularly occur across the country, but these tend to be focused on single issues; the cost for individuals and activists of collective action focused on broader political change remains high. The government tends to respond constructively when confronted with specific economic grievances. A mixture of state support and administrative pressure will keep major enterprises operating in provincial industrial towns.
The political system leans heavily on the charismatic leadership and popularity of Mr Putin. The weakness of most political and legal institutions, as well as the personalised, opaque governance system around Mr Putin, could present difficulties in managing an eventual presidential transition. Any successor is likely to come from the team around Mr Putin and will not herald a sharp change in the policy agenda. However, it may be difficult for any successor to build popular legitimacy given the weak economic outlook. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect a political transition in the forecast period. Speculation about an eventual succession strategy is likely to intensify soon after the 2018 presidential election, however, and this will further depress business confidence and raise political uncertainty.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
The next presidential election will take place in March 2018. We expect Mr Putin to contest the election and win by a wide margin in the first round. Aleksei Navalny, an anti-corruption blogger and nationalist opposition politician, will be barred from participating in the presidential election following a second conviction for defrauding Kirovles, a timber company. This suggests that the authorities intend to run a tightly controlled contest, offering voters no meaningful alternatives to Mr Putin. The main challenge for the authorities will be to prevent a sharp fall in turnout, which would throw doubt on the legitimacy of Mr Putin's popular mandate. This is one of the reasons behind the efforts to revitalise the regional leadership with the replacement of poorly performing governors.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
The Ukraine conflict has led to a sharp deterioration in Russia's relations with the West since 2014. In response to the conflict in Ukraine, the US and the EU have imposed sanctions on senior Russian officials and the Russian financial, energy and defence sectors. Russia has responded with a ban on almost all Western food imports.
The Minsk II ceasefire agreement, signed in February 2015, is highly unlikely to lead to a comprehensive political resolution of the conflict in Ukraine. The constitutional reform mandated by the agreement, which could formally embed Russia's proxies within Ukraine's political system, is politically toxic in Ukraine. In the highly unlikely event that it is passed, there is little chance that Russia will allow Ukraine to re-establish control of its side of the international border. Russia sees Ukrainian integration with the EU and NATO as a direct threat to its national interests, even though the second of these remains unlikely. Russia will not step back from its long-term objective of preventing a pro-Western govern-ment from consolidating in Ukraine. The current status quo, of a regularly breached ceasefire with contained levels of fighting, appears likely to endure for several years.
Donald Trump, the new US president, has voiced scepticism about US alliances in Europe, expressed his admiration for Mr Putin and appears more amenable to forming an anti-terrorist coalition with Russia. However, it now appears unlikely that Mr Trump's plans to reconfigure relations with Russia will be realised. As anticipated, Mr Trump's stated desire for rapprochement with Russia has encountered strong resistance from the US security establishment. The links between senior figures close to Mr Trump and Russian officials have been the subject of intense media scrutiny, making it difficult for the administration to take measures perceived as offering concessions to Russia. Moreover, Mr Trump's decision to launch a strike on a Syrian airbase in early April has again set Russian and US policy on Syria-an area where Mr Trump's advisers had hoped to build co-operation-on divergent paths. We now believe it likely that US and EU sanctions will be retained in the medium term, throughout most, if not all, of the forecast period. Russian counter sanctions on Western food imports are also likely to remain in place indefinitely.
Regardless of Mr Trump's stance, Russia's broader foreign policy will remain vehemently opposed to Western integration with the countries of the former Soviet Union. Russia's policy towards its neighbours, and towards Ukraine in particular, will be an enduring source of tension with the West. Regime change in any country in Russia's immediate neighbourhood, particularly via popular uprising, would be likely to trigger a crisis in relations between Russia and the West.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
With the economy set to return to growth in 2017, the constraints on macro-economic policy will ease. However, the fiscal position remains precarious. We expect the government to remain committed to a relatively tight fiscal and monetary policy to keep borrowing and inflation in check.
Economic reform will be subordinated to the imperatives of political stability and regime survival. We do not expect the government to move substantively towards liberalisation of the economy, and certainly not before the presidential election in March 2018, although some reform is possible.
A more likely scenario is that the government will seek incrementally to improve the efficiency of the system by replacing failing officials and bureau-crats, and cracking down selectively on corruption. Following the presidential election, the government is likely to extend the pension age and conduct a limited tax reform. Progress in strengthening the rule of law and protecting property rights is likely to be limited. The government will continue to sell minority stakes in some major state-controlled assets. However, as with the sale in December 2016 of a 19.5% stake in Rosneft, a Russian oil giant, the govern-ment's focus is on raising short-term budget revenue rather than increasing the level of competition in the economy or reducing state influence over it.
Russia's stand-off with the West has strengthened statist and protectionist trends within the government. Economic sovereignty-understood as insulating the economy from external shocks-will remain a strategic priority. The main elements of this strategy include a large positive sovereign external asset position (low public debt combined with substantial foreign-exchange reserves), protectionist measures to encourage import substitution and support domestic manufacturing, and a cautious approach to globalisation and foreign investment (which in "strategic sectors", such as the extractive sector, is likely to be permitted only in partnership with state-controlled companies).
Some policymakers have urged a further increase in state intervention in the economy, along with capital controls, expansionist monetary policy and a return to a fixed exchange rate. We believe that the government will continue to pursue a mixed approach, observing the broad tenets of a market economy and avoiding disruptive reforms and excessive market-distorting behaviour (such as capital controls) while maintaining a large state role in the economy.
We expect the government to remain committed to its import substitution policy, and formal and informal barriers to external trade will remain significant.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
The government faces tight budget constraints as a result of international sanctions, low commodity prices and the reluctance of Western banks to handle international bond issuances (although Russia succeeded in placing two Eurobonds in 2016). The deficit in 2016 was the equivalent of 3.5% of GDP; however, this included extraordinary income from the sale of a stake in Rosneft in December last year. Without this, the deficit would have been 4.4% of GDP.
Under the government's budget for 2017, spending will fall from Rb16.4trn (US$276bn) in 2016 to Rb16.2trn. This is broadly in line with the Ministry of Finance's proposal in July that spending be frozen for the next three years in nominal terms (which was based on the original expenditure target for 2016 of Rb16.1trn). Based on an average oil price of US$40/barrel in 2017, the govern-ment expects revenue to rise by 1.8%.
We forecast a higher oil price than set out in the budget, of US$56/b. This should boost revenue from the hydrocarbon sector. However, in early February the finance ministry announced that it intended to accumulate the extra tax revenue as foreign-exchange reserves, rather than transferring it directly to the budget. Overall, we forecast a deficit of 2.8% of GDP. We expect the finance ministry to continue to trim the deficit in 2018-19, but the fiscal adjustment is likely to be less radical than planned, particularly given the forthcoming presidential election. We believe that the government is unlikely to hold expenditure fixed in nominal terms in 2018-19 as planned. We forecast that the deficit will narrow to 1% of GDP by 2021.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
At its meeting in March the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) cut its policy rate by 25 basis points, to 9.75%, having held the rate unchanged since September last year. The strong rouble, driven by higher oil prices and the carry trade, has helped to push disinflation ahead of the CBR's expectations. At its mid-April meeting, the central bank indicated that a further cut in its policy rate was possible on April 28th. We expect the CBR to reduce its policy rate to 8-8.5% by the end of the year. We expect further loosening of monetary policy in 2018. Once inflation reaches the 4% target-a goal that we expect to be achieved before the end of this year-the CBR governor, Elvira Nabiullina, has suggested that an appropriate level for the real interest rate would be about 2.5-3%.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Russia's growth was decelerating even before 2014, as it ran into structural constraints. The economy experienced a sharp recession in 2015 as result of the fall in the oil price. The impact of this was masked in the headline numbers by sharp import contraction, but real household incomes declined by almost 20%. The Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) now estimates that the economy contracted by 2.8% in 2015 and 0.2% in 2016.
We have revised up our forecast for 2017 growth to 1.8%, from 0.9% previously. Surveys suggest that consumer confidence is at its highest level since the second half of 2014, helped by the appreciation of the rouble and slowing inflation. Retail sales volumes grew by 2.4% quarter on quarter in January-March-the first quarterly increase since October-December 2014. Leading indicators for services and manufacturing have also reached levels last recorded prior to the 2015-16 recession.
Fiscal consolidation will continue to constrain public consumption and infrastructure spending. We expect a weak recovery in investment, after three years of contraction. Corporate deleveraging will slow and external financing conditions are likely to improve marginally. A relaxation of Western sanctions-not our core forecast-would provide a modest boost to investment. However, perceptions of political risk would remain high, limiting foreign direct investment (FDI) outside the commodities sector.
The stabilisation of the economy should see continued growth in investment in 2018, although it will remain relatively weak. A forecast slowdown in China will hit Russia's terms of trade, and we expect Russia's growth rate to moderate to 1.6%. The public sector will remain a drag on domestic demand.
In the medium term, outdated capital stock, a declining workforce, dependence on natural-resource sectors, institutional weaknesses, low investment and statist policies will limit real GDP growth. We forecast that real GDP growth will average about 1.7% per year in 2018-21, in line with CBR estimates of Russia's trend growth under the current institutional and macroeconomic framework. There currently seems to be little prospect of far-reaching domestic institutional reform. High political risk and the poor business environment will continue to depress investment below the level needed to develop a higher trend growth rate. The declining work force will also be a constraint on headline growth, although in some sectors this will be offset by continued high immigration from the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
The CBR is aiming to reach its inflation target of 4% by the end of the year. It has a firm commitment to a relatively tight monetary policy as it aims to reach this inflation target. Inflation stood at 5.4% year on year in December 2016, but had slowed to 4.3% by March 2017. Disinflation has been assisted by a strong harvest last year and by the appreciation of the rouble. Both factors could prove to be temporary, and inflation expectations remain elevated. We forecast that consumer price inflation will average 4% in 2017 and that the CBR will more than meet its year-end target. The slowdown in China will lead to a depre-ciation of the rouble in 2018, but external inflationary pressures are likely to be relatively low. Tax changes in 2019 are expected to push up inflation slightly in that year. Overall we expect inflation to remain close to-but slightly above-target in the medium term.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
Higher oil prices and relatively tight monetary policy, which has boosted the carry trade, has led to a significant appreciation of the rouble against the US dollar. It reached Rb55:8:US$1 in late April-the strongest level for almost two years. We expect the rouble to depreciate from this level in 2017 as the CBR gradually loosens monetary policy. The rouble is highly correlated with the oil price, and any rapid fall in the oil price could lead to renewed exchange-rate volatility. We forecast an average full-year rate of just under Rb60:US$1. Our forecast growth slowdown in China in 2018 will hit Russia's terms of trade, and we expect the rouble to depreciate by about 6% against the dollar on average in that year. Oil prices are forecast to be stable in 2019-21, and we therefore do not expect significant movements in the rouble-dollar rate.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
We forecast an increased current-account surplus in 2017 as higher oil prices boost the value of exports. This will be tempered by higher imports as domestic demand and investment pick up, alongside increased outflows on the primary and secondary account. We expect the current account to remain in surplus throughout the forecast period, but a further recovery in imports will gradually reduce the size as a share of GDP. International sanctions and political uncertainty will depress FDI and portfolio inflows, although we expect these to recover in 2018-21.

Full text:   Country forecast overview: Highlights
The president, Mauricio Macri of the centre-right Propuesta Republicana (Pro), is pressing ahead with a programme of economic policy adjustment in an effort to eliminate distortions and return the economy to sustainable growth. The adjustment process is proving difficult, involving politically unpopular austerity measures, and the risk of social unrest will therefore remain significant for much of the forecast period.
Given the president's minority position in Congress, and the priority given to urgent macroeconomic reforms, there is likely to be only limited progress on the pursuit of legislation that would successfully address longstanding institutional weaknesses and structural constraints to growth. Comprehensive reforms to strengthen bureaucracy, reduce corruption or enhance the effectiveness and independence of the judiciary will be slow. Furthermore, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect meaningful advances-at least in the short term-on a structural reform agenda (incorporating tax and labour market reform) that could improve long-term potential growth rates.
After a contraction in real GDP in 2016, reflecting macroeconomic policy tightening and currency depreciation, we are forecasting a pick-up in exports, investment and private consumption in the medium term. There will be a boost in business confidence from policy tightening. Combined with macroeconomic adjustment, and a gradual removal of foreign-exchange and import controls, these policies should set the economy on a more solid long-term footing. However, some aspects of the policymaking environment will remain suboptimal, with labour-market reform and a comprehensive fiscal reform remaining low on the agenda.
Currency adjustment should gradually bolster the current account as a weaker peso starts to boost goods and services exports and rein in imports. On this basis, we expect the current-account deficit to narrow in 2017-21 from the 2016 peak. We also expect the country's ability to finance moderate current-account deficits to improve over the forecast period, assuming that capital inflows pick up as investor confidence in the Macri administration grows.
Argentina's GDP per head is still among the highest in the region and, combined with improved access to credit, moderate rates of economic growth in the medium term will boost purchasing power and create market opportunities. Still-high poverty rates and income inequality will restrict the pool of consumers, but to a lesser extent than in many other countries in the region.

Argentina's global business environment score improves substantially in 2017-21, and the country jumps 20 places in our global ranking. A period of economic policy adjustment is under way as the centre-right government works to tighten macroeconomic policy, reduce state intervention in the private sector and encourage private investment. However, in many areas improve-ments will take time to materialise.
Country forecast overview: Argentina's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: The administration of Mauricio Macri works to address key weaknesses, including weak competition policy, the heavy burden of red tape and restrictive price controls.
2019-21: Continued work to build confidence in legal and regulatory framework. State participation in key sectors continues.
Policy toward foreign investment
2017-18: Efforts to resolve any remaining disputes with international creditors and investors as the government seeks fresh sources of US dollar inflows.
2019-21: Foreign direct investment is welcome. Improvement made in investment dispute settlement and availability of investment-protection schemes.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Any remaining foreign-exchange controls likely to be removed. Continued efforts to improve the workings of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union) and develop closer relations with the Pacific Alliance.
2019-21: Possibility that free-trade agreements make better progress.
Taxes
2017-18: Further gradual reductions of export taxes to encourage domestic supply. Tax system remains complex and burdensome.
2019-21: Comprehensive tax reform to improve federal-provincial revenue a possibility, but obstacles to reform persist.
Financing
2017-18: Banking penetration remains weak and long-term credit restricted, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, owing to weak long-term deposit base.
2019-21: Non-bank financing grows, but is constrained by a relatively small pool of institutional investors.
The labour market
2017-18: Tension with unions, owing to inflation. Political and bargaining power of the unions will remain strong.
2019-21: Progress on labour reform unlikely. Continued potential for conflicts with unions. Some skills shortages.
Infrastructure
2017-18: The Macri administration works to address weak contract rights and deficient regulatory regimes, which keep private investment below potential. Financing constraints hamper public investment in the short term.
2019-21: Some public and private investment set to improve energy supply and upgrade export infrastructure, but the risk of energy shortages will persist as demand grows.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates. b Actual.
Background: Economic liberalisation in the 1990s resulted in firm growth, but an inflexible exchange-rate mechanism and failure to deepen structural reform left the economy vulnerable to shocks, contributing to the collapse in 2001 of Fernando de la Rúa's centre-left government. An interim government took power until Néstor Kirchner of the Peronist party began a term in 2003. He presided over an economic rebound, which enabled his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, to win the presidency in 2007 and secure re-election in 2011. Economic policy mismanagement drove a change of government in 2015, with a centre-right candidate, Mauricio Macri, taking office in December 2015.
Political structure: Democracy was restored to Argentina in 1983 after 50 years of instability and military regimes. A strong presidential system is in theory checked by a bicameral Congress, comprising a 257-member Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and a 72-member Senate (the upper house); in practice, however, the presidency dominates. The presidential term is four years. There are 23 provinces and the Buenos Aires federal district, each with its own government.
Policy issues: Pro-cyclical expansionary policies contributed to GDP growth of an annual average 6.6% in 2005-11. But expansionary policy also produced significant imbalances in the economy in the form of double-digit inflation, real peso appreciation and a deterioration of the balance of payments. Amid currency pressures, the Fernández government resorted to foreign-exchange, import and capital controls, as well as ad hoc interventionism, to the detriment of the business environment. These policies did not reduce devaluation speculation, and left the economy extremely vulnerable to currency crisis. Macroeconomic adjustments to reduce economic distortions and set the economy on a more solid long-term footing are taking place under Mr Macri; these include peso devaluation, and fiscal and monetary tightening. Microeconomic reforms to boost domestic supply are also getting under way.
Taxation: The value-added tax (VAT) rate is 21%, although VAT on some goods and services is charged at a lower rate of 10.5%, and some services are taxed at a higher rate of 27%. Corporate income tax is levied at 35%, and personal income tax at progressive rates between 9% and 35%. There is a 0.6% tax on financial transactions (deposits and withdrawals). Taxes on exports were reintroduced in 2002, and have since been expanded to account for around 20% of total revenue.
Foreign trade: The current account shifted from surplus to deficit in 2010. Despite comprehensive controls, there was a current-account deficit of 2.7% of GDP in 2015.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
The political scene is becoming more complicated as voter fatigue with austerity measures increases and patience with adjustment measures wears thin. Increase obstructionism on the part of public-sector unions in recent weeks is unsur-prising amid annual wage bargaining negotiations that are taking place in the run-up to mid-term legislative elections in October. More of a concern for the president, Mauricio Macri of the centre-right Propuesta Republicana (Pro), is the continued perception of voters that adjustment is not bringing about obvious rapid improvements in the economy. Various economic indicat-ors suggest that the economy is indeed emerging from recession, but consumers are not yet feeling the benefit in terms of higher real wages or increased employment.
We do not expect Mr Macri to change course and abandon the adjustment process that he has pursued since taking office for a four-year term in late 2015. This process has involved devaluation, fiscal and monetary tightening, and sharp tariff adjustments. In this environment, voter weariness with austerity, combined with the approach of mid-term legislative elections in October, will in the short term complicate relations with Congress, where the president lacks a majority. The ruling Cambiemos alliance, which includes the Pro and the centre-left Unión Cívica Radical, has to negotiate support for its legislative agenda in both houses of Congress on an ad hoc basis with the various factions of the large Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party). So far this support has mainly been forthcoming, not least because the largest opposition force, the leftist-populist faction of the Peronist party, known as the Frente para la Victoria (FV), has been weakened by a series of damaging corruption scandals.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects obstructionism to increase amid election-related politicking ahead of the October 2017 mid-terms, and as the October 2019 presidential election approaches. But mutual interest will ensure some co-operation between Cambiemos and moderate Peronists. A strong executive branch (the president has substantial powers to rule by decree) should also provide Mr Macri with room for manoeuvre, even assuming that Congress becomes less co-operative. The president will retain influence with powerful provincial governors, who largely control the Senate agenda but are in turn deeply reliant on central government transfers, some of which are discretionary. As a result, we expect some continued progress on the govern-ment agenda.
However, we assume that with electoral considerations coming into play, there will be limited progress on legislation that would successfully address long-standing institutional weaknesses and structural constraints to growth. Compre-hensive efforts to strengthen bureaucracy, reduce corruption, or enhance the effectiveness and independence of the judiciary will be slow. We do not expect meaningful advances on a structural reform agenda.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
Mr Macri's Pro party is small but increasingly influential. Apart from the presidency, it now controls the governments of Buenos Aires city and province, which together account for almost half of the population. However, the Pro is in a minority position in both houses of Congress, and although it may make some gains in mid-term legislative elections in October 2017, it is likely to remain in a minority position throughout the forecast period, given the dominance of the Peronist party in national politics and its strong grassroots presence. However, the Peronist party is split into various competing factions. Having lost the powers of patronage bestowed on it by the presidency, and amid its struggles with corruption allegations, the leftist-populist FV wing of the party will lose influence and the position of the traditional Peronist wing will improve, leaving it well placed to make gains at the expense of the FV in the 2017 mid-term elections.
The next presidential election is due in October 2019. Based on our assumption of moderate GDP growth and a return to single-digit inflation by then, we currently expect Mr Macri to win a second four-year term. There are substantial risks to this forecast, given the challenging external environment and the government's minority position in Congress. Reflecting the difficulties faced by minority governments in Argentina, no non-Peronist government has ever won a second consecutive term since the end of the military dictatorship in the 1980s. In this context, the emergence of a strong challenger from the moderate wing of the Peronist party is a strong possibility and the election will be closely fought.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Efforts by the Macri administration to repair relations with trade and investment partners have achieved rapid results, and we expect relations with key trade partners in the region and elsewhere to remain strong, with the possible exception of the US. Like most other governments in Latin America, the Macri administration was wrong-footed by the victory of Donald Trump in the US presidential election in November 2016. After cultivating increasingly strong ties with the previous US administration, led by Barack Obama, Mr Macri is likely to abandon recent efforts to secure preferential trade ties with the US with a view to an eventual free-trade agreement. The Argentinian government will remain keen to seek trade deals under the auspices of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay; Venezuela was suspended from the group in 2016). The problem for Argentina and its Mercosur partners is that, just as the grouping has started to reverse its own protectionist tendencies, free trade has shifted off the political agenda not only in the US but also in Europe. Mr Macri recently visited Spain in an effort to drum up support for the deal, and negotiations are continuing. Our forecasts do not currently assume a successful conclusion of free-trade talks with the EU, but the workings of intra-Mercosur trade are, at least, likely to improve in the forecast period. Efforts at joining the Pacific Alliance, a regional trading bloc that includes Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico, may also make progress, although this is not currently reflected in our five-year economic forecasts.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
The Macri administration has made good initial progress on a pro-gramme of adjustment intended to put the economy on a sounder footing, having devalued the peso, reduced agricultural export duties and energy subsidies, and secured a deal with holdout creditors (allowing Argentina to exit default). However, macroeconomic adjustment remains incomplete, and policy efforts to reduce inflation, which remained substantially over 30% in March, will continue, in the form of tight fiscal and monetary policy and restraint in nominal wage growth. The latter in particular is proving a difficult political challenge, and has encountered stiff union resistance. Some slippage on the government's goal of limiting nominal wage growth to 20% this year appears likely, but we do continue to expect nominal wages to trend downward steadily from levels of above 30% in recent years. All these measures should gradually engender price stability and ultimately boost investor confidence, although we do not expect inflation to fall to single-digit levels until 2019.
With macroeconomic adjustment measures proceeding apace, the government is gradually turning its attention to the structural reform agenda and to reforms to improve the business environment, and we expect a growing policy emphasis on these areas. The government has already passed new public-private partnership framework legislation that should facilitate an increase in infrastructure investment, along with reforms to reduce red tape financing for small and medium-sized enterprises. The development of longer-term finance and the deepening of Argentina's currently shallow capital markets will be a priority going forward. However, other aspects of the policymaking environ-ment will remain suboptimal, with progress on labour market reform (to improve flexibility) or comprehensive fiscal and tax reform (to reduce costs and complexity) unlikely in the medium term amid political obstruction.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
Higher-than-expected revenue from a tax amnesty on undeclared foreign assets will bolster the fiscal accounts and bring the government closer to meeting its fiscal targets. We expect the overall fiscal deficit to come in at 4.2% of GDP in 2017, slightly below the 4.5% of GDP registered in 2016. We expect the government's gradualist approach to fiscal tightening to continue in subsequent years, bringing the fiscal deficit down to a more manageable level of around 2% of GDP by the end of the forecast period, and eliminating the primary deficit by 2021. To date, the govern-ment has taken some important steps to try to narrow the deficit, particularly by reducing costly subsidies and the public-sector payroll. Even so, in the light of recently announced income-tax breaks and increased transfers (to expand the social safety net), deficit reduction will be slow. There are also downside risks to our forecasts, which rest on two key assumptions: that expenditure as a share of GDP will fall by slightly over 1 percentage point (reflecting a smaller public-sector workforce, a further drop in subsidies and a reduction in the deficits of state companies); and that revenue will increase by around 1 percentage point in the same period (assuming that recent tax cuts are more than offset by a pick-up in revenue from trade and increased economic activity).
In the aftermath of the holdout deal, and assuming that there is progress on deficit reduction, the government's ability to finance moderate deficits without resorting to inflationary money printing will be much improved. A moderate public debt/GDP ratio (and low levels of external indebtedness), combined with the attractiveness of Argentina's still-high yields, should facilitate international bond issuance in 2017-21, following Argentina's exit from default earlier this year. In January the sovereign issued US$7bn in five- and ten-year global bonds. As a percentage of GDP, the public debt will stabilise at slightly under 50% in 2017-21.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
Notwithstanding a recent policy reversal, which saw the Banco Central de la República Argentina (BCRA, the central bank) lift the policy rate from 24.75% to 26.25% in April, we continue to expect fairly substantial rate cuts in the second half of 2017 and beyond. The policy rate is well down on the year-earlier peak of 38%, but inflation has been slow to come down amid a series of tariff increases, and inflation expectations have been rising as a result, to slightly over 21% at end-2017, well above the central bank's 12-17% target range for this year. The BCRA has responded with what we expect to be a one-off rate rise to make its commitment to the newly implemented inflation-targeting framework clear. Assuming that monthly inflation starts to fall towards 1% on a consistent basis, we expect ample scope for renewed monetary easing from later this year.
The Bank has made clear that it will prioritise monetary policy that is consistent with a reduction of inflation, and our forecasts assume moderately positive real interest rates in the medium term, consistent with a deepening of credit and the development of long-term lending. This forecast is supported by the shift to an inflation-targeting regime (with the target due to be lowered to 8-12% in 2018 and to 5% in 2019), and assumes reduced political interference after a period of politicisation under the previous administration.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
After a contraction in real GDP of 2.3% in 2016, we expect real GDP to return to positive territory in 2017. But with Brazil likely to post barely positive growth in 2017, manufacturing activity in Argentina will recover only moderately, limiting GDP growth to 2.7%. We currently expect the recovery to peak in 2018, with growth of 3.6%. However, the annual growth rate for that year masks an expected sequential deceleration in the second half of 2018, resulting from a projected weakening of Chinese import demand. By 2019, when we project a cyclical downturn in the US economy, real GDP growth in Argentina will slide back below 3%, before a modest recovery takes hold again in 2020-21.
Our forecast for a still relatively robust recovery in the medium term is based on the assumption that a combination of macroeconomic adjustment and improvements to the business environment will eventually have some beneficial impact on both export activity and domestic demand. An easing of inflation, combined with efforts by the Macri government to address the problem of legal and regulatory uncertainty and reduce red tape, should set the stage for renewed strong growth in fixed investment and private consumption, supporting an acceleration of GDP growth.
There are downside risks to our GDP forecasts, as attempts by the government to reduce economic distortions and engineer a smooth adjustment to a lower-inflation environment could prove extremely challenging, keeping both con-sump-tion and investment subdued for longer than we expect. However, there is also some upside risk, as investment could overtake expectations from 2017 once the gains from macro-economic adjustment materialise and depending on the success of efforts to improve the framework for doing business. However, even in this scenario, in the absence of deeper structural reform efforts than we currently envisage, the potential growth rate will remain closer to 3% than 4%.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
The Macri administration introduced a new consumer price index in May 2016 to address widespread concerns about the quality of official data. However, because of a lack of historical data to provide a full picture of 12-month inflation trends, for the time being we are continuing to use the Buenos Aires city consumer price index as a proxy for inflation at the national level. This showed 12-month inflation of 35% in March 2017. Although high, this does represent a steep fall from a peak of 44.4% in May 2016, which resulted from currency and tariff adjust-ments by the new administration. Assuming tight monetary and fiscal policy (spending will remain negative in real terms until 2018), the inflationary spike will prove transitory, and we expect gradual disinflation in the medium term, provided domestic demand remains subdued relative to the boom years of 2004-11 and domestic supply strengthens on the back of an improved regulatory environ-ment for agricultural producers. The main risks to this forecast stem from possible failure to tighten fiscal policy as projected, a weaker than expected peso and the difficult process of reining in nominal wage growth. However, if the government is able to tackle the high level of wage indexation (a key obstacle to the reduction of inflation towards OECD levels), there is also the potential for inflation to slow more than we currently project.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
Owing mainly to increased portfolio inflows, the peso has appreciated in 2017, standing at around Ps15.2:US$1 in late April. We expect renewed modest weakening in 2017-21, particularly in the first half of the forecast period as domestic interest rates continue to decline and the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) continues a monetary tightening cycle. However, the positive outlook for portfolio and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows will be supportive of the currency, which will dampen depreciation pressure and produce some periods of real currency appreciation (as has occurred in recent months). In nominal terms, we expect the peso to end 2017 at Ps17.78US$1 and 2021 at Ps23.61US$1.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
As the terms of trade improve and a weaker peso gradually boosts goods and services exports, improvements in the trade and services accounts will cause the current-account deficit to narrow. From 2.6% of GDP in 2016, we expect the deficit to fall to an annual average 1.2% of GDP in 2017-21. We also expect the country's ability to finance moderate current-account deficits to improve, assuming that portfolio and FDI inflows pick up as investor confidence in the Macri administration grows. The result will be a rise in foreign reserves in nominal terms. Our forecasts currently assume FDI inflows averaging 2% of GDP in 2017-21, with foreign reserves equivalent to an annual average 8.1 months of import cover in the same period.

Full text:   Country forecast overview: Highlights
The struggle between an opposition-dominated legislature and a government with control of key institutions will keep tension high and sustain uncertainty regarding The Economist Intelligence Unit's political and economic forecasts. Despite the unpopularity of the administration led by the president, Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), and the persistent risk of economic collapse, we believe that the government will muddle through until the next elections are held in December 2018, after which we expect the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática coalition to take office. That said, a risk exists that the PSUV will seek non-democratic ways to cling to power.
A fundamental rebalancing of the economy is needed to avoid default and economic collapse, but there has been no sign of significant economic reform. Policy mismanagement will persist while Mr Maduro remains in office. Key problems include extremely expansionary macroeconomic policy, soaring inflation and a business climate that discourages investment. A new government will begin a gradual process of adjustment from 2019.
Sweeping reforms are required to restore confidence in contract and property rights, and thereby promote a recovery in investment. The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. From 2019 a new government will encourage private investment, re-establish market mechanisms for price stability and attempt to undo the constraints imposed by the PSUV on private firms.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and triple-digit inflation will hit private consumption, while the increasingly difficult operating environment will deepen the fall in fixed investment. After a deep recession in 2016, GDP will contract further in 2017 and will not return to growth until 2020. Our forecast for a weak recovery in 2020-21 rests on the assumption of an increase in oil prices and a new government that implements macroeconomic adjustment alongside institutional and structural reform. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, and our forecasts imply only a partial recovery.
At almost 300bn barrels, Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves, but its oil sector has suffered from disinvestment and mismanagement owing to political interference. The government claims that rising investment in the energy sector will lift oil production significantly in the medium term, but we foresee a continued fall in production in 2017, and only a very minor increase from 2018 as economic conditions stabilise.

Venezuela is in 79th position globally in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings for 2017-21, out of 82 countries covered. It is therefore one of the least attractive investment locations. This reflects state interventionism, highly heterodox macroeconomic policies, a lack of legal security and weak institutions. Regionally, Venezuela moves ahead of Cuba to 11th place of the 12 countries covered, assuming improvements after 2019.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Government persists with bias against free markets and ad hoc recourse to heterodox measures. Nationalisation poses a diminished threat, given fiscal weaknesses. Property rights remain weak. Price fixing undermines profitability.
2019-21: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Access to project financing is difficult and uncertainty over contractual rights persists.
2019-21: Efforts to attract foreign investment gather pace under a new government, but actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection remains weak.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2017-18: Frequent ad hoc adjustments to the unorthodox exchange-rate policy framework add to uncertainty. The state continues to exercise tight control over access to official-rate US dollars. Private firms must use a much weaker rate.
2019-21: Efforts to remove trade and exchange controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves gradually, after a political transition takes place.
Taxes
2017-18: Risk of tax increases diminishes, given the depressed state of public consumption. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2019-21: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2017-18: Credit growth remains firm, but sectoral allocation is distorted by administrative interventions. Banks remain highly profitable, although unpredictable enforcement and a weak regulatory framework heighten instability.
2019-21: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance is in short supply.
Labour market
2017-18: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. An ongoing freeze on redundancies, combined with a large informal sector and skill shortages, makes the labour market exceptionally rigid.
2019-21: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Access to water and electricity supplies remains precarious. Underinvestment in power transmission ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2019-21: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued electricity rationing.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed 1992 coup. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez was diagnosed with cancer in 2011 but, after declaring in July 2012 that he had fully recovered, won a fourth presidential term in October 2012. However, his health quickly deteriorated and he died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has since plummeted.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is a federal republic, successive administrations have proven reluctant to devolve political authority, with the transfer of financial resources from federal to local level highly dependent on the central government. The legislature is unicameral, and elections for the National Assembly take place every five years. In December 2015 the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática took control of the legislature, but has since met fierce opposition from other branches of government dominated by the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela.
Policy issues: Political radicalisation has been reflected in increasingly heterodox economic policymaking, with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus, and the nationalisation of industries deemed strategically important. Distortions created by this approach have become evident, with inflation rising sharply in spite of price controls, and with capital controls spawning a rampant black market for foreign exchange. Failure to invest part of the oil windfall has led to a startling decline in physical infrastructure. Non-oil production has in effect ground to a halt, leaving the economy entirely dependent on the energy sector. With large oil shipments going to China to repay loans, and (on subsidised terms) to regional neighbours via the PetroCaribe oil-financing scheme, the country is running very short of US dollars, forcing cuts in import spending.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 60% for oil firms. Since 2011 a maximum royalty of 95% has applied to oil extraction. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the merchandise trade surplus fell from US$27.2bn in 2014 to US$768m in 2015. The current-account balance is estimated to have turned negative in 2015, posting a 4.3% of GDP deficit. The deficit is estimated to have narrowed to 2% of GDP in 2016, owing to import compression.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
Amid the most severe economic crisis in the country's history, Venezuela's political scene will remain dominated by a volatile power struggle between the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) government, led by the president, Nicolás Maduro, and the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD), which won a majority in the National Assembly in late 2015. Opposition efforts to unseat Mr Maduro by legal means and through negotiations mediated by the Vatican before the next elections, which are due to be held in December 2018, have floundered amid tight government control of key institutions, including the government-controlled judiciary, which has effectively eliminated the National Assembly's powers. In addition, an increased role for the military in economic policymaking will bolster Mr Maduro's position, even if it comes at the expense of his own influence in government. Mr Maduro has handed substantial policymaking powers to the vice-president, Tareck El Aissami, a PSUV hardliner who is seen as being close to the army.
There remains a risk of an early (and chaotic) transition, which would be triggered if default occurs and/or hyperinflation takes hold, and intensifying social unrest causes military support for the PSUV to wane. But The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to muddle through until the December 2018 elections, in which the opposition MUD would be the clear favourite. However, there is a high risk that the PSUV, with the backing of the allied armed forces, will cling to power by non-democratic means, for instance by declaring an economic emergency as a justification for preventing the holding of presidential elections. Recent developments suggest this risk is growing-the Supreme Court recently issued a ruling that formally took over the powers of the National Assembly. Although it partially backtracked, this episode and others indicate that the government has little regard for democratic procedures. However, our current forecasts are based on the assumption that the December 2018 elections will go ahead, and that the MUD will win, taking power in 2019. A MUD-led government will implement economic adjustments to reduce the role of the state in the economy, and unravel the many macroeconomic and monetary distortions that the PSUV has implemented since it came to power in 1999. It will also begin the difficult task of reforming deeply politicised institutions. Given the scale of the economic distortion and institutional destruction that have taken place in Venezuela, there is a risk that this process will go less smoothly than we are currently forecasting.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
The electoral authorities are obligating political parties that secured less than 1% of the popular vote in at least 12 states in the December 2015 legislative election to re-register-in effect, all parties (59) aside from the ruling PSUV will have to do so. To remain in existence, opposition parties are required to secure the signatures of at least 0.5% of the electoral roll in at least 12 states, a criterion that is likely to force many small parties to fold. Some members and politicians will join other parties in the opposition MUD coalition, which is a broad church of anti-PSUV parties. But the process will cause some tension and the MUD may well emerge as a weakened political force. The opposition Primero Justicia has announced that Henrique Capriles-twice a defeated presidential candidate and the current governor of Miranda state-will seek to contest the December 2018 presidential election. Given that the MUD coalition is likely to select its candidate through a primary election, Mr Capriles's candidacy is not assured, but he currently is the frontrunner. The PSUV is unlikely to be re-elected, but there is a risk that it will use non-democratic means (requiring the backing of the military) to remain in power. We assume that the MUD will form the next government and retain control of the legislature, allowing it to pass its agenda, although weak institutional capacity and high political tension will persist.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Venezuela's relations with its neighbours will remain strained while the PSUV is in office, and the election of Donald Trump as US president will sustain underlying bilateral tensions. PSUV governments have periodically stoked animosity towards the US in order to drum up nationalist support, but the Trump administration is more likely than any of its recent predecessors to react to this with economic measures such as a cut in oil imports, which would hit Venezuela hard. This appears to have encouraged Mr Maduro to tone down his anti-US rhetoric so far, but tension would escalate if the PSUV government were to cling to power by suspending the December 2018 elections, which is a risk. Mr Maduro will seek closer ties with China, but further financial support is unlikely to be forthcoming in the short term. Reflecting its external financing difficulties, Venezuela will continue to scale back-and possibly end-oil shipments to beneficiaries of PetroCaribe, an agreement that provides cheap financing for oil exports to regional allies. Relations with Cuba, the closest of these allies, will become more distant as Venezuela's ability to provide economic assistance is eroded. Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) suspended Venezuela in December 2016 and members of the Organisation of American States are likely to suspend Venezuela too, highlighting a growing international consensus over the need to reprimand the government. Nevertheless, relations with Colombia have improved; Venezuela has recently permitted passage through some border crossings to allow its citizens to buy food and medicine in Colombia.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
It seems increasingly unlikely that the government will be able to manage the build-up of inflationary and currency depreciation pressures without some sort of policy adjustment between now and the presidential election. In the absence of other alternatives, we assume that the Maduro government will be forced to weaken the currency more substantially in 2017 and 2018 than it did last year. However, other much-needed reforms are unlikely to be addressed by a government that has proved unwilling or unable to adjust policy sufficiently to move Venezuela's economy away from the brink of collapse. Fiscal and monetary policy will remain expansionary, and ad hoc policy interventionism and heavy state control of the economy will persist. Slightly higher oil prices will bring some relief, but import compression will remain necessary, as other sources of foreign exchange will be hard to find. At US$10.4bn in early April, international reserves remain far below historical levels, and are only about two-thirds of their end-2015 total. Even after a 2016 restructuring of debt owed by PDVSA, the state-owned oil firm, substantial external debt payments are falling due in 2017-the next one being a US$2.1bn coupon payment on April 12th. We currently expect Venezuela to meet its 2017 obligations, which are mostly owed by PDVSA. However, given the extremely thin reserves cushion, the risk of default remains high, and would have dramatic economic and political consequences in the form of a sharp decrease in oil production, reduced import capacity, hyperinflation and probable political turmoil.
We expect the opposition to take power in 2019, ushering in much-needed market-driven adjustments designed to correct currency distortions, alleviate shortages of basic goods, tighten expansionary fiscal policy and rebuild institutional capacity after years of deterioration under PSUV rule. It is probable, given the scale of the challenge, that the new government will seek a financing agreement with the IMF to support the adjustment process; we have factored in accumulated lending of over US$16bn in 2019-21. Efforts to secure increased inflows of foreign direct investment would also be likely under a new government, and would help to improve the balance-of-payments dynamics, although we expect direct investors to remain cautious for some time with regards to Venezuela, with the possible exception of the oil sector.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
The authorities' failure to publish data on the non-financial public sector since 2012 demonstrates the opacity of the public finances and complicates accurate forecasting of the size of the deficit. After ballooning to an estimated 24.3% of GDP in 2016, we expect the deficit to stand at a still-large 19.6% of GDP in 2017 and remain in double digits in 2018. The election of a new government should help to ease the deficit to 5.9% of GDP by 2021. The large deficits of the present are mostly being financed by printing money; the money supply, as measured by M2, rose by 198% year on year in March, the highest rate on record. Meanwhile, high inflation and an overvalued currency are eroding the relative value of domestic and external debt, making debt/GDP ratios unreliable indicators of fiscal stability.
There is considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing, mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA. As these items are excluded from the public debt statistics, the true size of total public liabilities is understated. In October 2016 the government undertook a bond swap that sees around US$2.8bn of PDVSA debt due in 2017 (of US$10bn in total PDVSA and sovereign debt) pushed out to 2020. This will alleviate some pressure, but does not resolve the country's external financing difficulties; we continue to see an extremely high risk of default. Despite this, the government has emphasised its commitment to pay, and we expect the next administration to follow through with its debt-servicing and repayment obligations.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
Monetary policy under the Banco Central de Venezuela (the central bank) will continue to be driven by the government's desire to keep real interest rates negative and to print money to finance large fiscal deficits. Amid extremely high inflation, we expect real rates to remain deeply negative in 2017-18. From 2019 our forecast of substantial currency and fiscal adjustment under a new government also implies a substantial tightening of monetary policy. We expect interest rates to rise sharply that year, declining only moderately thereafter.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Ongoing disruption to Venezuela's productive base and a collapse in consumer spending mean that, after a massive contraction in GDP in 2016 (estimated at 14%), we project a further contraction, of 5.5%, in 2017. We do not expect the government to make the necessary adjustments to bring about a proper economic recovery, and we thus forecast that recession will persist into 2019. Even after this, recovery will be relatively weak, given the depth and length of the downturn. Our forecast for a recovery in 2020-21 rests on our assumption of slightly higher oil prices, alongside a political transition that produces a combination of macroeconomic adjustment, and institutional and structural reform. However, reform will take time to bear fruit, given the scale of the recession, and our forecasts therefore imply only a partial rebound; overall we expect real GDP to have declined by nearly 30% in 2014-19.
After dropping by an estimated 20% in 2016, private consumption will contract further in 2017-18, reflecting the impact of soaring inflation on real wages and disposable incomes, as well as government compression of imports. Imports account for a large share of consumer goods, owing to Venezuela's weak manufacturing base, which has been further eroded by currency distortions. Fixed investment will continue to contract sharply, reflecting the difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange, and remitting profits. Our forecast for a recovery in investment in 2019-21 is based on expectations of a political transition, progress on long­delayed joint projects with Chinese firms in the energy sector and-towards the end of the forecast period-a pick-up in public-sector investment. Exports will continue to shrink in 2017-18 as oil production falls further, but will pick up in 2019-21, reflecting increased investment under a new government, and a removal of constraints to domestic production. Import demand will rise faster than exports, in line with an alleviation of basic goods shortages and the release of pent-up demand from the recession years. Even after the change in government, however, dependence on oil will persist, and the next government will have to begin a process of economic diversification to produce a more robust domestic economy and promote non-oil exports.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
A decimation of domestic supply and severe shortages of foreign-exchange reserves have caused inflation to soar for much of the past two years. It will remain very high in the medium term, but we expect a disinflation process later in the forecast period, assuming a change of government. No new official inflation data have been released since end-2015. However, according to unofficial data from Cenda, a local think-tank, the price of a basic basket of goods increased by 9.9% month on month in January, bringing 12-month inflation to an estimated 508%. Money supply (M2) growth accelerated to 198% in late March, up from 159% in December. Assuming that price pressures remain high in the first half of 2017 at least, we expect average inflation to be higher this year, at 555%, than in 2016. However, we continue to forecast a decline in inflation over time, reflecting moderately higher oil prices, which will bring in the necessary foreign exchange to help to alleviate scarcity of goods and the impact of persistent recession on demand. From 2019 fiscal and monetary policy adjustment will also be supportive of a gradual reduction in inflation towards double-digit levels (in year-on-year terms). However, before this happens, the lack of funds available for importing basic goods suggests that shortages will be rife, and the risk of hyperinflation (which we define as monthly inflation of more than 50%) will remain substantial.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
The authorities manage a dual exchange-rate system composed of an official peg, known as the Dipro, which is limited to priority public-sector imports and set at BsF10:US$1, and a heavily managed rate known as the Dicom. The Dicom rate weakened by 70% in nominal terms in 2016 and stands at BsF710:US$1 currently, but it accounts for less than 10% of all official transactions. In real terms, the average exchange rate (weighted by volume of transactions) continued to appreciate substantially in 2016, creating ever greater pressure for currency adjustment, the need for which is evident in the black-market rate (BsF4,100:US$1 in early April).
In March the government announced that it was planning changes to the Dicom but gave few details. The pegged Dipro rate appears increasingly unsustainable, and we assume that the government will devalue the rate to BsF25:US$1 this year and again in 2018 (to BsF500:US$1). We currently assume that the government will increase the share of Dicom in foreign-currency transactions to 50% by 2018, up from a current level of about 8%. This would effectively constitute a maxi-devaluation, as distortions to the exchange rate would otherwise become unsustainable. Further major currency adjustment under a new government in 2019 will involve immediate exchange-rate unification. In the meantime, given existing distortions in the foreign-exchange market, there is an extremely high risk of a debilitating currency crisis in the short term. If confidence in the bolívar collapses amid hyperinflation, dollarisation-or the launch of a new domestic currency-could occur.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
The current-account deficit will narrow further in 2017-18, reflecting severe import compression and a moderate recovery in oil prices, which will outweigh a continued gradual decline in oil output. The deficit will widen thereafter on the assumption that economic recovery draws in imports on a large scale after years of pent-up demand and in line with an easing of external financing constraints. Nevertheless, risks to the balance of payments will persist, although our assumption of economic adjustment in the medium term suggests some recovery in capital inflows, particularly into the oil sector. This should help to rebuild reserves coverage, although our forecasts assume that even by the end of the forecast period in 2021, reserves will cover only slightly more than three months of goods and services imports.

Full text:   Country forecast overview: Highlights
The Economist Intelligence Unit assigns a high risk to the grand coalition government of the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) and the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) not serving its full parliamentary term to 2018, despite the coalition parties' recent renewal of their agreement.
Political risks have risen since mid-2015, as public unease about the influx of migrants and dissatisfaction with the mainstream ruling parties has boosted support for the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPÖ) and heightened intra-coalition tensions amid still weak economic growth. Since late 2015 opinion polls have shown support for the FPÖ at about 32%, above both coalition parties.
Following several years of policy paralysis, in January 2017 the coalition parties announced a renewed coalition agreement. However, we expect im-plementation of the announced measures to be troublesome. If the government faces significant difficulties in delivery, we would expect the federal chancellor, Christian Kern (SPÖ), to push for early elections. He already seemed to be doing so during the recent negotiations and he may want to cash in on his continued popularity before a failed reform attempt sullies this.
Little progress is expected in most areas of the government's reform agenda. This policy paralysis will hamper efforts to improve competitiveness, which over recent years has deteriorated relative to Austria's regional peers.
The government budget is forecast to remain in deficit, albeit well within the EU-mandated limit of 3% of GDP, throughout the forecast period (2017-21) as the fiscal consolidation process suffers under limited government cohesion and effectiveness. However, we expect the public debt/GDP ratio to fall gradually.
Economic growth in recent years has been tepid as productivity has weakened and export market shares have declined. Real GDP grew by 0.8% in 2015 but accelerated to 1.5% in 2016, driven by domestic consumption and invest-ment demand. We expect a slight acceleration of growth in 2017, to 1.8%, reflecting mainly catch-up growth, and forecast average annual growth of 1.5% in 2018-21.
Structural factors, including higher unit wage costs and more regulated markets, will keep inflation higher than in regional peers; after 1% in 2016, we forecast 2.1% inflation in 2017 and 2% on average in 2018-21.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 18 countries: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK.
Austria's business environment score improves slightly between the historical period (2012-16) and the forecast period (2017-21). As a result, the country rises to 11th place in the regional ranking and to 18th in the global ranking. Austria's strengths as a business location include decent infrastructure, stable institutions and co-operative labour relations, but high taxes, limited market opportunities and restrictive regulations will persist.
Country forecast overview: Austria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Government works on reducing red tape, but progress is likely to be limited. Barriers to entry to network industries are likely to persist.
2019-21: Modest strengthening of the competition authority's powers. Administrative reform reduces red tape. More transparency in antitrust proceedings. Risk of political interference in private firms in which state owns substantial stakes.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Foreign investment is generally welcome, but underlying opposition to takeovers of "national champions" persists.
2019-21: Possible erosion of barriers against foreign takeovers as a result of commercial pressure and EU legislation.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: No exchange controls. Foreign trade, governed by EU rules, should remain liberal, but further liberalisation unlikely.
2019-21: EU likely to accelerate shift towards bilateral free-trade agreements as multilateral trade negotiations stagnate.
Taxes
2017-18: No significant changes to the tax system, owing in part to government ineffectiveness.
2019-21: Some tax reform is likely if a government including the Freedom Party (FPÖ) takes power. Vested interests will continue to hamper large-scale reform and the high tax burden will remain.
Financing
2017-18: Financial stability to improve amid tighter regulatory requirements. Credit conditions ease gradually as banks' profitability recovers. Downside risks from financial, legislative and macroeconomic risks in central and eastern Europe.
2019-21: Introduction of systemic risk buffer of banks' risk-weighted assets. Further uptake in corporate bond issuance.
The labour market
2017-18: Economy-wide minimum wage is introduced. More stringent requirements for early retirement and invalidity pensions. Labour market slowly improves as increase in labour supply moderates and unemployment starts to drop.
2019-21: Continued expansion of labour supply, primarily via net immigration, but concerns about shortage of skilled employees in certain sectors are likely to persist. Early retirement phased out.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Further take-up of broadband services. Gradual improvement of transport links with eastern Europe.
2019-21: Improved transport network connecting main urban centres and providing better access to the country's interior. Gradual transition to low-carbon economy entails significant changes to electricity transmission infrastructure.

Background: Austria became an important force in central Europe with the formation of the Habsburg empire in the 15th century and remained so until the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the first world war. The Republic of Austria emerged in 1918. In 1938 Austria was incorporated into the German Third Reich. With the departure of the victorious Allied forces in 1955, it regained independence as a neutral country. In the post-war period Austria took great strides to catch up economically with the rest of the developed world and is now one of the most advanced nations. It is a member of the EU and a participant in the economic and monetary union (EMU).
Political structure: Austria is a federal republic and the head of state is the federal president. The government is led by the federal chancellor. The national parliament has two houses: the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house), of 62 members appointed by state parliaments, and the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house), which has 183 members elected by proportional representation. The last general election was held in 2013; the next is due in 2018.
Policy issues: The government's stated priorities are to reduce the budget deficit and debt pile, improve labour market participation rates, strengthen competitiveness, increase expenditure on research and development, continue to reform healthcare expenditure, stabilise the financial sector and raise educational standards. Progress on these issues will be modest at best as tensions surrounding immigration, security and border controls will remain elevated across Europe, diverting attention to security and migration-related policy areas.
Taxation: According to the European Commission, Austrian labour tax as a percentage of GDP is the second-highest in the EU. A 2016 tax reform lowered the tax burden for low- and middle-income earners, but raised the top personal income tax rate from 50% to 55%. Social security contributions, shared between employers and employees, are high. Corporation tax is levied at a rate of 25%. Dividend and investment income is subject to a withholding tax of 27.5%. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a standard rate of 20%, and a reduced rate of 13% (raised from 10% in 2016) applies for certain goods and services.
Foreign trade: In 2015 the value of exported goods was US$142.1bn and the goods import bill was US$140.4bn. The services surplus, traditionally boosted by tourism receipts, was US$11.2bn. Along with a significant primary income deficit and modest secondary income deficit, this yielded a current-account surplus equivalent to 1.9% of GDP.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
The Economist Intelligence Unit assigns a high risk to the grand coalition government of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) calling an early election before the end of its term in October 2018. In May 2016 Werner Faymann (SPÖ), the then chancellor, resigned and was succeeded by Christian Kern (also SPÖ), then the head of the state railway firm.
A clear trend in recent state elections and in the presidential election in 2016 has been gains for the opposition far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) at the expense of the SPÖ and the ÖVP. Opinion polls continue to show support for the FPÖ at about 32%, well ahead of the SPÖ (at 29%) and the ÖVP (at 19%). The FPÖ is the well-established party of protest, attracting support from voters who are dissatisfied with the current government. It is therefore not surprising that support for the FPÖ has increased at a time when there is a widespread perception of stalemate within the current coalition, along with concerns about immigration, stagnant economic growth and rising unemployment. The fraying of the decades-long dominance of the political scene by the SPÖ and the ÖVP will weigh heavily on political stability in the years ahead. The FPÖ candidate eventually lost the presidential election, and by a larger margin the second time round, after it was rerun following irregularities in the vote counting process. However, that the FPÖ candidate, Norbert Hofer, twice managed to gain almost half of the vote, and on a high turnout, endorses our view that support for the FPÖ has become entrenched.
Recently, the outlook for the coalition surviving has improved slightly, after the two parties presented a new coalition agreement in late January 2017. In this they presented a number of measures, including a new minimum wage and en-hanced security measures. However, relations between the two parties remain tense, and there are serious questions over whether it will be possible for the coalition to implement the announced reforms. In particular, it is uncertain whether Mr Kern and Reinhold Mitterlehner, the leader of the ÖVP, have a sufficient hold over their parties (and over the social partners and provincial governments, both of which are vital to implementation) to deliver the agree-ment in full and to the agreed timetable. If the government does face significant difficulties in delivery, we would expect Mr Kern to push for early elections. He already seemed to be doing so during the recent negotiations, and may want to cash in on his continued popularity before a failed reform attempt sullies this. The same is likely to be the case for the ÖVP, which will want to profit from the popularity of Sebastian Kurz, the minister of foreign affairs and most likely candidate to lead the party in the next election; some polls suggest that the ÖVP would win the election should Mr Kurz lead it instead of Mr Mitterlehner. We continue to believe that an early election is a likely scenario.
The FPÖ is likely to win either an early election or the next scheduled one and subsequently to attempt to form a government, although it remains unclear with which party it will choose to do so. The FPÖ's proximity to power means that it tends to moderate its views slightly compared with far-right, populist parties in other European countries, such as France and the Netherlands. Mr Kern has been vocal in his disapproval of the FPÖ, but has been moving towards the party in terms of policy, including by pushing for curbs on intra-EU labour migration and by recently stating that his own party and the FPÖ were the only parties in Austria that wanted change. Regardless of which coalition emerges, we expect political stability to deteriorate further in the second half of our forecast period (2017-21). Relations with fellow EU member states will worsen in the event that the FPÖ enters government, putting pressure on the FPÖ's coalition partner, and we expect a government led by the party to be unstable, as it would struggle to implement its policies.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
The next general election is scheduled for September or October 2018. Whether it takes place then or earlier, we forecast that the FPÖ will become either the largest or the second-largest party and will then probably form a coalition with either the SPÖ or the ÖVP.
Elections for some state parliaments are planned for the first half of 2018. The next election for the primarily ceremonial post of federal president is in 2023.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Austria was severely affected by the European migrant crisis, and this has been the dominant issue in its international relations since 2015. The country has been at the centre of many of the intra-EU spats regarding the bloc's response to the large influx of migrants, owing in part to its unilateral actions. Domestic pressure on the government to be seen as acting against this influx, and thus often against other EU member states, will remain high owing to the rise of the FPÖ, and it seems to have driven the government to lower its annual cap on asylum applications. The government has repeatedly hinted that it wants to limit labour migration within the EU, or at least give preferential treatment to Austrian citizens on the labour market, which will exacerbate tensions with many EU member states.
The rerun of the presidential election in December 2016 demonstrated the relatively broad support for EU membership. Many voters cited as one of their main reasons for voting for Alexander Van der Bellen-the independent candidate running against Mr Hofer-suggestions by Mr Hofer of a possible membership referendum in Austria if the EU did not reform or if Turkey joined. This experience should moderate any further attempts by the FPÖ to use the EU as a divisive issue.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
Alongside the 2016 tax reform, which provided about EUR5bn in tax relief to households, government policy has focused on challenges facing the country's financial sector. These have included the clean-up and debt restructuring of Heta Asset Resolution (Heta), a "bad bank" that was created to deal with the toxic assets of Hypo Group Alpe Adria (HGAA). The uncertainty surrounding Heta was removed in October 2016 when creditors accepted a debt-restructuring deal. The government has also had to manage the banking sector's exposure to central and east European economies.
In its renegotiation of its coalition agreement in January 2017, the coalition decided on a number of measures that it hoped to implement before the end of its term, in 2018. These include a new annual minimum wage of EUR21,000, as opposed to only sector-specific negotiated minimum wages, and reducing red tape for employers, including more flexible rules on working hours. However, we are sceptical that tangible progress will be achieved in most of these areas, owing to a lack of cohesion within the grand coalition and within the parties themselves at the different levels of government. The same is true for a coherent policy response to relatively high unemployment, despite continued (albeit weak) growth, and the sustainability of the pension system, despite a widely shared belief in the need for reform. The next government, which is likely to include the FPÖ, will move integration and immigration policy further to the right, but we would expect it to struggle to implement significant structural reforms rapidly.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
In 2014 Austria's fiscal accounts deteriorated, mainly reflecting the govern-ment's decision to create a bad bank to deal with HGAA's toxic assets. The fiscal deficit widened to the equivalent of 2.7% of GDP, from 1.3% in 2013, and public debt rose to 84.4% of GDP. Mainly in response to steady direct revenue growth, the deficit narrowed to 1% of GDP in 2015, although the public debt/GDP ratio increased further, to 85.6%.
We estimate that the deficit widened in 2016, to 1.4% of GDP, owing in part to fiscally expansionary tax reforms and higher migrant-related public spending. We expect the budget to remain in deficit throughout the forecast period, albeit within 1% of GDP from 2018, as fiscal con-solidation will continue to be limited and growth relatively slow. The public debt stock as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline gradually, from an estimated 84.6% in 2016, following a positive contribution from the Heta deal, to just above 76% in 2021. In the context of the quantitative easing (QE) undertaken by the European Central Bank (ECB) and Austria's relatively strong fundamentals funding risks are extremely low in our view.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
Amid heightened political risk the euro zone economy is showing increasing growth momentum and we expect another healthy expansion in the region's economy this year, after growth of 1.8% on average in 2015-16. Nonetheless, the ECB is continuing to pursue an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero, a series of so-called targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) aimed at pushing banks to lend more money and an EUR80bn per month QE programme, which will fall to EUR60bn per month from April until the end of 2017.
The ECB's president, Mario Draghi, has emphasised that the reduction in the pace of QE was designed to sustain the bank's presence in the market for a longer period than if purchases continued at the current rate, and should not be viewed as "tapering", which would signify a winding down of the programme. We expect tapering to begin in 2018, but downside risks to global growth during that year, including our forecast for an economic slowdown in China and tighter monetary policy in the US, suggest that the pace at which the ECB unwinds its accommodative policy stance will be gradual. We maintain our forecast that the ECB will not tighten policy rates before the end of our forecast period, in 2021.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Austria's initial recovery from the global financial crisis was respectable in the euro zone context, but subsequently the economy largely stalled and under-performed in comparison with regional peers, notably with Germany, which was particularly striking given the traditionally high level of synchronisation between the two countries' business cycles. Real GDP rose by a sluggish 0.8% in 2015, and although it accelerated in 2016, to 1.5%, this remained below growth of 1.8% in Germany.
The economy's relatively lacklustre performance in recent years reflects a number of factors. Austria's domestic reform process has faltered, and along with higher inflation compared with its regional peers this has weakened productivity and competitiveness, admittedly from fairly high levels, in relation to countries such as France, Germany and the Netherlands, hindering export performance. This has depressed labour market prospects. In recent years the labour market has not been able to integrate the increased labour supply, caused in part by the influx of migrants last year, and this has pushed up the unemployment rate, even though employment has been growing. This, in turn, has weighed on consumer sentiment, meaning that much of the windfall for consumers from low oil prices since late 2014 has been saved instead of consumed. Although inflation has picked up recently following increasing global energy prices and positive base effects, we expect continued moderate consumption growth owing to a modestly improving labour market.
We expect the current phase of catch-up growth, following an underperformance even compared with fundamentals in recent years, to continue and we have made an upward adjustment to our real GDP growth forecast for 2017, to 1.8%. This still compares negatively with, for instance, the Netherlands, where catch-up growth in recent years has been around 2%. We expect the lack of reform progress to continue to weigh on growth throughout the forecast period and expect domestic demand to be the main driver of growth, which is likely to converge towards potential growth in the coming years. We therefore expect average real GDP growth of just 1.5% in 2018-21.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
Annual consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) has been subdued in recent years, but higher than in most other euro zone countries. Inflation averaged 0.8% in 2015 and 1% in 2016, well above average inflation in Germany and the euro zone in both years. This largely reflects structural domestic factors, such as higher unit wage costs, more regulated markets and a period of faster increases in taxes and duties. Rising services prices, energy price base effects and the lagged feedthrough of euro weakness via import costs fostered a gradual rise in inflation in the final months of 2016 and January-February 2017, and will con-tinue to do so in the rest of 2017, when we forecast full-year average inflation of 2.1%. We expect inflation to stay above the euro zone average in 2018-21, at 2% on average, as similar structural factors as in previous years persist.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
The euro has moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1 since mid-2015 and averaged US$1.11:EUR1 in 2016, with a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1, reflecting the sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following Donald Trump's election victory in the US. We now forecast an annual average rate of US$1.06:EUR1 in 2017 and US$1.07:EUR1 in 2018, reflecting heightened political risk in Europe and strong growth in the US, with the euro then appreciating gradually in 2019-21.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
Low oil prices and subdued domestic demand compressing import values helped the trade balance to move into surplus in 2014-15, from a deficit in 2009-13. The recent recovery has pushed up imports and is estimated to have pushed the trade balance back into deficit in 2016. We expect further growth and higher oil prices to continue to weigh on the trade balance in the coming years. However, this will be compensated for by a healthy surplus on the services balance, driven in large part by robust tourism inflows. We therefore expect continued current-account surpluses in our forecast period of just below 2% on average.

Background: The political geography of Europe has been defined by two world wars and the legacy of the cold war, during which Europe was divided into two blocs. The ending of Soviet control over central and eastern Europe from 1989, followed by the collapse in 1991 of the Soviet Union, provided an opportunity to expand the EU eastwards. Ten new member states (eight from the former communist bloc) were admitted to the EU in 2004, followed by a further two in 2007, and Croatia in 2013. In June 2016 the UK electorate voted in a referendum to withdraw from the EU. The economic transition of the Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) has proceeded more smoothly than that of other east European countries. The effects of war in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and a slower pace of reform have shaped developments in south-east Europe.
Political structure: All 28 EU member states are parliamentary democracies, although in some of the newer, former communist members in particular the substance of democracy-including a political culture based on trust and healthy levels of political participation-is often absent. The communist period lasted much longer in the former Soviet Union, and political developments in most parts of that region have been characterised by a drift towards authoritarianism.
Policy issues: Many aspects of domestic policy for EU member states-in particular those relating to the single market-are decided collectively at the level of the EU. Nineteen EU member states share the euro as their currency. These countries are subject to a single monetary policy administered by the European Central Bank (ECB). They are supposed to comply with common fiscal rules, although these have often been ignored. During the euro zone debt crisis several member states (Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain) ceded varying degrees of policy control to the EU and the IMF in exchange for receiving financial support. Although the euro zone crisis has passed its peak, normalisation remains a long way off. The Economist Intelligence Unit continues to attach a 60% probability to Greece leaving the euro zone during its medium-term forecast period. Outside the EU, the speed and extent of reform and of institutional change vary widely. Countries with proximity to Western markets and with stable political outlooks have proceeded faster and more successfully with economic stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation. Institutional problems, such as weakness in the rule of law and widespread corruption, plague much of non-EU Europe.
Taxation: Individual tax regimes operate in all countries. All EU member states must operate a system of value-added tax (VAT), with a minimum of 15% as the standard rate.
Foreign trade: If intra-EU trade is included, the EU accounts for about half of all global trade. Around 60% of trade conducted by EU member states is intra-regional.

Summary
Political stability
It is a time of increasing political fragmentation across much of the region. This makes it more difficult to form stable governments and implement policy.
The UK got a new prime minister and cabinet in swift succession following the EU referendum in June 2016, helping to bolster stability at a time of uncertainty.
The rejection of constitutional reforms in a referendum in Italy in December 2016 has resulted in the formation of an interim government. It is vulnerable to party manoeuvring ahead of the next general election, due in early 2018.
Electoral risk remains high in the EU, as populist forces will challenge mainstream parties in elections in several major countries in 2017.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects EU sanctions on Russia to be extended again in mid-2017, but there is a risk they will be eased over the medium term.
Economic policy
We forecast big changes in the UK's economic policy mix following the Brexit vote. Monetary policy has already been loosened and the government is prioritising long-term investment, as fiscal projections have worsened.
We expect the monetary stance to remain exceptionally loose across much of the rest of the region. We do not expect the European Central Bank (ECB) or the Bank of England (BoE, the UK's central bank) to increase policy rates by 2021.
We expect some rebalancing of the mix between monetary and fiscal policy in the euro zone as governments seek to respond to voter dissatisfaction. However, the bloc's rigid fiscal rules could make this a contentious process.
Economic reform has progressed well in certain countries, notably the Baltics, Spain and Ireland, but for most the main challenges lie ahead. With political fragmentation on the rise, policymaking is becoming more difficult.
Economic growth
We expect a growth slowdown in the UK in 2017-18 as the start of Brexit negotiations heightens uncertainty, hitting investment and private consumption.
The short-term economic fallout from Brexit will be modest for Europe, but the UK's departure will exacerbate weaknesses that have been holding back the region's economic recovery in recent years.
Business environment rankings
The business environment has improved in most European countries as they have eased into a weak recovery phase. However, fragilities remain.

Political outlook: Political stability
The UK has returned to a situation of relative political stability following an initial period of chaos triggered by the country's referendum vote on June 23rd 2016 to leave the EU. Nevertheless, the outcome of the referendum will on occasion test stability and will be decisive in shaping politics in The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecast period (2017-21). The Conservative Party prime minister, Theresa May, will trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty on March 29th 2017, beginning the formal, two-year process of the country's withdrawal from the EU. In a speech on January 17th Mrs May confirmed that the UK would leave the EU's single market, in line with the government's intention to honour the Brexit vote by establishing control over EU migration and ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK.
Given the government's intention to negotiate trade deals with other countries outside the EU, the UK might also have to leave the EU customs union (which allows goods to move freely without customs checks). Mrs May has said that she would like the UK to have tariff-free access to EU markets, but full customs union membership would mean a common external tariff and, crucially, would prevent the UK from negotiating trade deals with other countries. An alternative option would be a customs agreement with the EU, implying partial or associate membership. If the UK does leave the customs union, the govern-ment is likely to pursue a free-trade agreement. Whether or not the UK stays in the customs union, UK-EU trade ties are likely to remain close. The government will aim to reach a deal on the new UK-EU trading relationship by the close of the two-year negotiating period, in March 2019. At that stage the UK will formally leave the single market, and the terms of the new relationship, which could contain sector-specific arrangements, will be phased in gradually. There are risks to this forecast. If negotiations fail and no extension of the deadline is agreed by all 27 EU members, the UK will leave the EU in 2019 without any deal in place and revert to World Trade Organisation (WTO) trade rules.
Depending on how successfully Mrs May can navigate the Brexit process and implement her domestic policy agenda, she could potentially remain in power beyond the next general election, due in 2020. However, the possibility of an early election cannot be ruled out, especially if the government encounters significant obstacles in parliament to the terms of its Brexit deal. Either way, with the main centre-left opposition Labour Party likely to struggle to prove itself to be a credible alternative government, we forecast that the Conservative Party will enjoy an extended period in government. The Brexit vote and its aftermath have confirmed that the mainstream political parties are out of touch with large swathes of the electorate, but the UK's first-past-the-post electoral system makes it difficult for smaller parties to translate an increased national vote share into parliamentary seats.
The UK's decision marks another phase of Europe's institutional crisis
The UK's vote to leave the EU represents a further stage in a rolling regional political and economic crisis that began in 2010. This crisis has been defined by a failure of the region's institutions to provide effective governance and leadership in response to political and economic challenges. The early stages of the crisis were characterised by challenges to the survival of the single currency. We believe that the threat to stability in the region is much wider-this has been demonstrated by the events of the past two years. The euro crisis has not gone away, and the intra-bloc tensions that it has engendered have been compounded by the 2014-15 migration crisis, the rise of anti-establishment and anti-EU political parties, and now by the first-ever decision by a member state to break away from the bloc.
In managing its multiple crises since 2010, the region has had to resort to "muddling through". This policy approach has been moderately successful so far, certainly when compared with some of the disastrous outcomes that could have transpired. However, muddling through, by definition, does not offer a long-term strategy for addressing the region's problems and it has eroded the political capital of the policymakers involved. The region faces major unanswered questions-not least about its dire economic growth performance and whether further integration in the euro zone is (i) economically necessary and (ii) politically feasible. The resistance of policymakers to confronting these questions head on should not be underestimated. However, if Europe's leaders continue with this muddle-through policy, the political and economic costs may prove to be their undoing-as the tumultuous events of the past year illustrate.
We expect Mr Macron, an independent, to win the French presidential election
The 2012-17 presidency of François Hollande, of the centre-left Parti socialiste (PS), has been widely seen as a disaster. Mr Hollande will leave office in a few months as the most unpopular president in France's recent history and will not run for a second term. The slump in his ratings reflects his failure to deliver solid economic growth, to prevent a series of fatal terrorist attacks and even, at times, to act in a sufficiently presidential way. Public disappointment and frustration has spilled over from Mr Hollande to the political class in general, with polls and primary election results in 2016-17 indicating a keen desire to break with the status quo and force a change of political personnel. Polls suggest that the country is now in the unprecedented position, six weeks before the first round of the presidential election on April 23rd, of seeing both of the mainstream party candidates-from the PS and from the centre-right Les Républicains-eliminated before the second-round run-off, on May 7th. Fragmentation on the left has reduced the chances of the PS's presidential candidate, Benoît Hamon, who is a rebel from the far left of the party, getting into the second round, while François Fillon-who was chosen as Les Républicains' candidate in November-is mired in a public-funding scandal that emerged in late January.
Our core forecast is that Emmanuel Macron, a centrist independent and political newcomer, who started his own movement, En Marche!, in April 2016, will face Marine Le Pen, of the far-right Front national (FN), in the second round. We expect Mr Macron to win the presidency; however, his movement is unlikely to gain a majority in parliament in the legislative elections on July 11th and 18th. This means that gaining parliamentary support for his proposals will be unusually difficult, requiring far more inter-party negotiation than is typical in the highly presidential French political system. Political instability is therefore likely to be higher over our forecast period than in the recent past.
We expect Angela Merkel to remain in power after the 2017 election
Despite a marked increase in political volatility in Germany since 2015-largely as a result of the unprecedented surge of migrants entering the country-the country is likely to remain, in comparative terms, a source of political stability in Europe. Nevertheless, we expect the German political scene to be less stable over the forecast period than it has been over the past decade. Germany's current government-comprising a grand coalition of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD)-is led by Angela Merkel, who is in her third term as chancellor. Our baseline forecast is that the CDU/CSU will win the largest share of the vote in the September election and that Ms Merkel will continue as chancellor. However, a recent rise in support for the SPD, led by the former president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, since late January 2017, means that we now expect the election to be a close race between the mainstream parties.
Germany is not completely immune to the appeal of populism, as illustrated by the sharp rise in support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) over the past two years. In the 2013 election the AfD, running at the time on a mainly anti-euro platform, did not manage to breach the 5% threshold to gain representation in parliament. Its rise since then has been driven mainly by the inflow of migrants in 2015 and early 2016. The party managed to attract 24.2% of the vote in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt in state elections in March 2016, at the height of the outcry in Europe over the migration issue. Its support has waned in recent months, seemingly in part owing to support moving back to the SPD following the arrival of Mr Schulz; however, the AfD looks all but certain to win seats in parliament. This would be a significant moment for German politics, in which a party to the right of the CSU has long been taboo.
Germany remains an outlier, as, mainly for historical reasons, there is deep antipathy towards populist movements, especially those on the right. At the same time, this antipathy is far stronger in the west of the country than in the east, which remained under communist rule in the post-war period, until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The legacy of fascism will continue to shape German attitudes for years to come, but the recent rise in support for the AfD suggests that the country might merely be lagging behind others in the development of a populist movement. With the uncontrolled inflow of migrants having ended, we do not expect the AfD to make significant further inroads ahead of the election in September 2017, although our base case is that it will become the third-largest party. There is, however, no chance of any party forming a coalition with the AfD.
Election result puts to rest speculation about a Dutch exit from the euro or EU
The parliamentary election in the Netherlands on March 15th 2017 led to a fragmented result, with the centre-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) winning the most seats in the 150-seat parliament, with 33, down from 41 in 2012. The right-wing, populist Party for Freedom (PVV), led by Geert Wilders, which is the main outlet for public frustration with much of the traditional political mainstream, came second, albeit with 13 seats fewer than the VVD. Given the fragmented result and the peculiarities of the Dutch political system the formation of the next government might take anywhere from a few weeks to several months, or even longer. The PVV will not be part of the government, which we expect to include the VVD, the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and Democrats 66 (D66), with GreenLeft (GL) or the Christian Union (CU). The main political uncertainty over the longer term is whether populist parties-such as 50Plus, which represents older voters, and the PVV-will encounter limits to their support or not, and therefore whether they will ever be able to form a government. For now we do not expect this to happen, but if the next government struggles there is a small risk that disenchantment will grow to a level high enough to elevate someone like Mr Wilders into government.
Italy remains a particular pressure point within the euro zone. The overwhelming rejection of the flagship constitutional reform of the then prime minister and leader of the Partito Democratico (PD), Matteo Renzi, in a referendum in December 2016 has increased political instability, which will hinder prospects for political and economic reform in Italy. The government crisis triggered by Mr Renzi's resignation as premier was short-lived, but the government formed by Paolo Gentiloni, previously the minister of foreign affairs under Mr Renzi and a member of the PD, is weak and especially vulnerable to the political manoeuvrings within the divided PD and the wider coalition. In February 2017 Mr Renzi resigned as PD secretary to confront his critics in a leadership election due to take place on April 30th; however, this failed to prevent the breakaway of a large group of leftists. We expect Mr Renzi to be re-elected as PD leader, but given his abrasive leadership style this is unlikely to put an end to the party's internal turmoil. The PD leadership contest and the need to harmonise the electoral laws for the two houses of parliament before the next election have now all but ruled out the possibility of a snap general election in the coming months. We continue to expect the next election to be held at, or close to, the end of the current parliamentary term, in early 2018. We expect the next election to take place using a highly proportional voting system, which will increase political fragmentation further, complicating government formation after the election.
Against this unstable backdrop Mr Gentiloni's government has a difficult policy remit, including trying to keep the economic recovery on track while controlling the public finances, managing mounting problems in Italy's banking sector, dealing with a renewed inflow of migrants and tackling the aftermath of a series of deadly earthquakes.
In recent months the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) has ridden the wave of global populist sentiment. Even though its credibility has been dented by a series of political blunders and local-level scandals, most notably in Rome's city government, M5S is still likely to emerge as the largest party at the next election given very low levels of public satisfaction with the government and the political establishment. Nevertheless, we expect that M5S will fail to obtain a majority of parliamentary seats and that mainstream parties will coalesce to keep it out of office after the election. This is likely to exacerbate public frustration with the political process and further boost support for M5S.
Following the attempted coup in Turkey by parts of the military on July 15th 2016, there has been a sharp deterioration in the country's political outlook, which we expect to have lasting negative effects on its social stability as well as its international relations and economic prospects. Under the state of emergency rule that was introduced in late July 2016, there has been a government clampdown on suspected coup-plotters, political opponents and critics that has seen over 100,000 people, mainly in the judiciary, the military, the police, academic institutions and the media, suspended, dismissed or detained. The political scene will continue to be dominated by the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). Mr Erdogan's plan to establish a presidential system of government with few checks and balances on the executive powers of the presidency faces its final hurdle in a divisive national referendum, to be held on April 16th 2017. Most opinion polls, including polls commissioned by the AKP, suggest that the "no" camp has a narrow lead. However, we expect that a majority of voters will approve the reforms. The vote will take place under the state of emergency rule, which has created a climate of fear that could deter people from supporting the "no" campaign and from voting against the reforms. Nevertheless, the risk of the reforms being rejected cannot be overlooked, as Turkey's security and economic outlook has deteriorated. The reforms would not come into effect until after the parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled to take place in late 2019. Beyond the referendum, it is unclear what strategy Mr Erdogan and the AKP will adopt. We believe it is unlikely that there will be a rapid return to stability, regardless of the result.
Tensions between Russia and the West will persist during the forecast period
The conflict between Russia and the West will continue to shape the politics and economics of much of the region. NATO members placed the security threat posed by Russia at the heart of a landmark summit in July 2016, agreeing to deploy troops permanently in the Baltic States and Poland as an explicit deterrence to Russian aggression. However, the summit belied signifi-cant divisions within both NATO and the EU on Russia policy. These have become more pronounced following the election of Donald Trump as US president. Mr Trump has made clear his desire for an improvement in bilateral relations with Russia, and has cast doubt on US security guarantees to Europe. Eastern Europe has become the arena in which East-West tensions are being expressed. The expansion of the NATO alliance to include Montenegro has put the tiny western Balkan country in the eye of a political storm. Russia, which was accused by the Montenegrin authorities of being behind an alleged coup attempt on election day in October 2016, regards NATO expansion in the region as a provocation and a security threat. NATO meanwhile views Montenegro's accession as a way of countering Russian meddling and influence in the Balkans. The US is the only NATO member not to have approved Montenegro's NATO membership, agreed in principle in May 2016, after a vote on the matter was twice blocked by US senators opposed to further NATO expansion. The matter has the potential to inflame tensions between Russia and the West and between the US and its European allies. We expect a number of European NATO members to increase spending on defence in 2017-21.
Despite Mr Trump's election, we expect the tensions between the West and Russia, which have been exacerbated by the Ukraine crisis, to persist throughout the forecast period. The situation on the ground in eastern Ukraine is now broadly stable, but the "line of contact" between territory controlled by the Ukrainian government and Russian-backed separatists is highly militarised. Ceasefire breaches and fatalities are a regular occurrence. The ceasefire agreement signed in February 2015 in Minsk, the Belarusian capital, is unlikely to lead to a comprehensive political settlement. The constitutional reforms mandated by the agreement are politically toxic in Ukraine, and, as popular support for the government is low, the reforms are unlikely to be brought to a vote. Even if Ukraine passes the relevant laws, it is highly unlikely that Russia will allow the country to regain control of its international border and therefore re-establish full sovereignty over the territories that are currently controlled by Russian-backed militias. As a result, we expect the conflict between the Ukrainian state and the Russian-backed forces to remain effectively frozen. However, the status quo is unstable. The risk of a return to all-out war appears low, but cannot be entirely ruled out.
A thaw in Russia-US relations could exacerbate splits within the EU
The election in November 2016 of Mr Trump as US president has the potential to lead to an improvement in US-Russia relations. However, any rapprochement may be short-lived. Like Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, Mr Trump's leadership style depends on projecting an image of machismo and uncompromising strength. The two men could quickly come into conflict when the next international crisis emerges. Much of the political and security establishment in the US remains highly opposed to a rapprochement, and Russian officialdom will also remain strongly anti-American. A thaw in relations between Russia and the US could exacerbate splits within the EU on Russia policy. Senior figures in a number of countries, notably Italy, Greece and Hungary, have publicly attacked the EU's sanctions regime on Russia.
Recent developments in Kazakhstan suggest that planning for a transition of power is firmly under way. Nursultan Nazarbayev, who turns 77 in July, has ruled Kazakhstan since before independence in 1991. The political system concentrates a high degree of power within the presidential system; this has prevented the emergence of strong institutions, an independent media, and other checks and balances. In January Mr Nazarbayev announced a range of constitutional reforms that will notionally shift power from the presidency to the government and parliament. In practice, the impact on the political system is likely to be limited. Party politics is not competitive in Kazakhstan, and the parliament is dominated by Nur Otan, the "party of power" that supports the president. Political decision-making is therefore likely to remain highly non-transparent and informal.
We expect that Mr Nazarbayev will serve out his full term to 2020
Nevertheless, the announcement of the constitutional reform is a clear signal that succession planning is under way. At the same time, the frequency of reshuffles and purges of senior figures within the elite has risen. This is also likely to be linked to the succession process. Our core forecast is that Mr Nazarbayev will serve out his full term to 2020; however, the likelihood that he will depart sooner, as part of a managed transition, has risen. There is currently no clear successor, and any future leader may struggle to maintain elite coherence. There is a risk that the transition could lead to increased and more public conflict between the elite, which could prove destabilising. However, we believe all parties will have an interest in a managed process. Intense political uncertainty is likely to depress investment in the coming years and may reduce government effectiveness, as officials become more risk averse.
Political outlook: Le Pen win remains a risk in France
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right Front national (FN) and its candidate in the presidential election, has substantial popular support. She claims to speak to, and for, the "France of the forgotten", in particular former industrial workers in the rust belt north of the country who feel left behind by globalisation, as well as those in the south of the country concerned by questions of immigration and assimilation. She promises to "bring back the nation-state" by reclaiming sovereignty from the EU and putting a stop to uncontrolled immigration and the alleged Islamification of French society. Ms Le Pen has made significant progress in the "de-demonisation" of her party, which under the previous leadership of her father (Jean-Marie) was beyond the political pale, in the light of the pro-Vichy, pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic proclivities of its founders.
However, the FN nevertheless remains anathema to many voters because of these roots, as well as its anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant views. Ms Le Pen's desire to take France out of the euro zone also prompts significant concern among savers and pensioners. In addition, the structure of the electoral system works against her: the two-round vote means that she would have to gain more than 50% of the vote to win (almost double her current share of support). Moreover, centre-left and centre-right voters typically unite around the non-FN candidate in the second round to keep the far right out of power, and polls suggest that this will happen again this year, with Ms Le Pen losing by a large margin to whoever she faces.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a closer race than the polls imply, with a high rate of abstention posing the most serious risk, as this could boost Ms Le Pen's share of the vote. Our core forecast is that she will face Mr Macron in the second round; should his support drop sharply before the first-round vote, then François Fillon, the candidate for the centre-right party, Les Républicains, could face Ms Le Pen in the second round, and we would expect him to win instead. In the event that Ms Le Pen did win the presidency, she would struggle to implement legislation, especially on issues where her party holds a minority view, as she would have to work with a hostile parliament. For this reason, even if she were elected, we would not expect France to leave the EU or the euro zone.
Political outlook: Election watch
We expect political risk to remain high in Europe throughout the forecast period. In the euro zone, in particular, the negative political fallout from the financial crisis, coming on top of the long-term erosion of the post-war political party system, is proving to be electorally disruptive. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that fragmentation and difficulties forming a government occur even in countries that are registering solid rates of growth, such as Spain and Ireland.
In Ireland, a government was formed following the February 2016 election, but it is a precarious minority coalition administration and we expect it to fall in 2017. In Spain, the political dysfunction has been more pronounced. Following two inconclusive general elections and ten months of political gridlock, in early November 2016 the conservative Popular Party (PP) formed a minority coalition government led by the incumbent prime minister, Mariano Rajoy. It will be one of the weakest in Spain's democratic history. It can rely on just 170 votes-those of the PP (137 seats), Ciudadanos (Citizens; 32 seats) and the Canary Island Coalition (CC; one seat)-in the 350-seat Congress of Deputies (the lower house of parliament). The abstention of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) was necessary to unblock the political impasse. However, the PSOE will remain in opposition and will not support the PP government's legislation or its 2017 budget proposal. Mr Rajoy will therefore have to seek an ad hoc majority for each bill, with few options but to build coalitions with smaller, regional nationalist parties, like the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV; five seats). We do not expect the Spanish government to serve a full four-year term in office, with another early election being the most likely scenario. The political scene will remain fluid and fragmented.
We expect a more stable government in Croatia under Andrej Plenkovic
The Croatian parliamentary election on September 11th 2016 produced a more stable outcome than the previous election. The centre-right Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and its partners won a plurality of the vote, defeating the Social Democratic Party (SDP)-led coalition. The HDZ re-entered a coalition with Most (Bridge). The new government received the votes of 91 parliamentarians, a clear majority in the 151-seat parliament. We expect a more stable government under the leadership of Andrej Plenkovic, the new centrist leader of the HDZ and prime minister-the government has already passed a large tax reform package. However, there are signs that Mr Plenkovic will struggle to appease the vocal right wing of his party while maintaining a centrist policy orientation, and progress on reform in other areas, such as the public administration, and the pension and healthcare systems, will probably be slow in the face of powerful interest groups. Although Mr Plenkovic faces pressure from the HDZ's right wing, we do not expect him to be as aggressive in his nationalist stance as his predecessor as HDZ leader, Tomislav Karamarko. It is unlikely that Croatia's relations with Bosnia and Hercegovina (BiH) or Serbia will improve significantly over the forecast period. Relations between these countries typically fluctuate between hostile at worst and correct at best, and will continue to do so. We do not expect relations to break down completely, nor do we expect a return to violent conflict.
In the parliamentary election in Georgia on October 8th 2016 the ruling Georgian Dream-Democratic Georgia (GD-DG) won 48.68% of the proportional vote. The United National Movement (UNM) came a distant second, with 27.11%. On October 30th GD-DG won run-off elections in 47 out of 49 constituencies, bringing its total seats in parliament to 115 out of 150, a constitutional majority. Only three other parties secured seats in parliament: the UNM won 27 seats, the pro-Russian Alliance of Patriots of Georgia secured six seats and Industry Will Save Georgia just one. However, in a row over the continuing influence of the former president, Mikheil Saakashvili, in January 2017 the UNM split, with the bulk of the party's leadership, or 21 of its 27 members of parliament (MPs), forming a new parliamentary faction, European Georgia. Mr Saakashvili retains control of the rump UNM, now represented by just six MPs. GD-DG now controls most local governments, and with its overwhelming majority in parliament it can determine judicial appointments and amend the powers of the presidency. GD-DG has mentioned a plan to abolish direct presidential elections, with the president instead appointed by parliament. This would ensure a GD-DG president. Giorgi Kvirikashvili, the returning prime minister, has said that constitutional reform will be enacted, but has promised not to amend the constitution without engagement from a full range of stakeholders. We expect that GD-DG will undertake some moves to consolidate power, as was also the case when the UNM swept to a constitutional majority after the 2008 parliamentary election. However, close ties with the West remain important for much of the Georgian establishment, and international criticism may act as a moderating influence on any potential anti-democratic tendencies of the new government.
A presidential election will take place in Russia in March 2018. Suggestions that Mr Putin, who has dominated the political scene since 2000, was contemplating withdrawing from politics appear to have been misplaced. We expect Mr Putin to run for a fourth term (until 2024) and to win with a large majority in the first round. In January Aleksei Navalny, an anti-corruption campaigner and one of the most dynamic of the "non-systemic" opposition leaders, was found guilty for a second time of defrauding Kirovles, a timber company. His previous conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court following a judgment by the European Court of Human Rights. Mr Navalny's conviction prevents him from standing in the presidential election, and suggests that the authorities intend to run a tightly controlled contest, with little meaningful competition. The main challenge for the regime will be to secure a respectable turnout in the context of a relatively weak recovery in household incomes following two years of recession.
Populist forces will challenge main-stream parties in elections in 2017
There is a growing populist challenge to mainstream parties that is evident across Europe. The populists have shown themselves to be more prepared than the mainstream parties to debate the big political issues of the day, such as the impact of globalisation on income equality and national identity, and they are mobilising people to become engaged in the political process and to vote. In some cases the ruling elite has responded by dismissing the insurgent parties and their voters as deluded, manipulated or simply beyond the pale, and in other cases by shifting on to similar ground.
Important parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place in France in April/May and in Germany in September. In both of these contests anti-establishment movements and parties will be challenging mainstream political forces, albeit to differing degrees. Our core forecast is not for a surge of populist parties getting into power this year (although this is undoubtedly a risk). However, we expect strong support for these parties to give them an increasing influence on the topics of domestic political debate. We also anticipate growing difficulties with coalition-building as increasingly disparate mainstream parties try to find common ground to work together in order to keep the populists out.
SPD leadership change alters dynamic of the German election
Our baseline forecast for Germany is that Ms Merkel will remain in office until the 2017 election, will lead the centre-right CDU to victory, and will still be chancellor following the election, at the head of another grand coalition between the CDU, the CSU and the centre-left SPD. However, the SPD's change of leadership in late January 2017, with the former president of the European Parliament, Mr Schulz, replacing Sigmar Gabriel as party chairman, has significantly altered the political dynamic. Support for the SPD had hovered mostly around 2% in the polls since the 2013 federal election, well below that for the CDU/CSU. Mr Schulz, who benefits from a "novelty effect", has seemingly been able to tap into long-simmering frustrations over issues such as the flexible labour market by taking a traditional social-democratic stance in his first weeks as SPD leader, pledging to fight for social justice and combat inequality. As a consequence, the party's support has risen by about 10 percentage points since the start of the year, to just over 30%-neck and neck with the CDU/CSU. Ms Merkel remains a formidable opponent, however, with a reputation as a steady hand and a thoughtful decision-maker. After shooting up sharply, support for the SPD now seems to have stabilised. Ms Merkel's popularity was damaged in 2015-16 by her reaction to the migrant crisis, with her broadly welcoming response to a surge of migrant arrivals proving out of step with majority public opinion. However, a sharp drop in the number of arrivals last year-to 280,000, from 900,000 (equivalent to 1% of the population) in 2015-combined with a hardening of the government's stance on the issue, has reduced the political salience of the topic and eased the pressure on Ms Merkel. Together with the rise of Mr Schulz, this has caused the far-right, populist AfD to lose some of its support, which had picked up in the polls in 2015-16, as the party's anti-immigration message chimed with voters' concerns during the migrant crisis. The recent rise in support for the SPD has encouraged talk of a "red-red-green" coalition-comprising the SPD, the Left Party and The Greens-potentially unseating Ms Merkel and the CDU/CSU in September. However, we consider this fairly unlikely. Our view is instead that the improvement in the SPD's support makes another grand coalition with the CDU more likely-in part because it narrows both parties' options. Over the medium term, questions about who might succeed Ms Merkel as the dominant figure on the centre right will become more pressing, and the threat posed by the AfD will remain present.

Political outlook: Czech Republic: Andrej Babis set to dominate next government
The ANO movement led by Andrej Babis, a billionaire businessman and the current finance minister, has opened up a large lead in the polls over its coalition partner, the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD). This supports The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecast that Mr Babis will become the next Czech prime minister after the October 2017 parliamentary election, and that ANO could emerge as the dominant force in the next government. Mr Babis has been compared to populist nationalists such the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, and businessmen-turned-politicians such as the US president, Donald Trump. However, we see important differences here, as well as similarities. We would expect an ANO-led administration to focus on pro-business and anti-corruption reforms, with the Czech Republic unlikely to follow Hungary and Poland in the direction of illiberal democracy.
Since early 2014 ANO has consistently topped Czech opinion polls. Its nearest rival is its senior partner in government, the CSSD, which is led by the prime minister, Bohuslav Sobotka. The CSSD narrowly won the 2013 general election, but has since seen its support soften. Opinion polls now suggest that ANO opened up a decisive lead over the CSSD in the wake of the October 2016 regional elections, in which Mr Babis's movement performed unexpectedly well. A poll released on January 26th by STEM, a polling agency, projected a 29.9% vote for ANO in the October 2017 election, compared with 14.6% for the second-placed CSSD, in an electoral model assuming a turnout of just under 60%. Polling by another research institute, CVVM, published a day later, projected 32% of the vote for ANO and 19% for the CSSD.
If reproduced in the general election, this vote share would mean that ANO could potentially govern with the support of just one smaller party, such as the current junior coalition partner, the Christian Democratic Union (KDU-CSL). A less likely alternative is that the CSSD will revive its electoral support sufficiently to close the gap that has opened up with ANO, and force a continuation of the current three-party ANO-CSSD-KDU coalition, albeit with ANO taking over as senior partner and Mr Babis becoming prime minister.
A Czech Trump?
Some commentators have seen Mr Babis as a central European strongman with similarities to Hungary's populist prime minister, Mr Orban, or Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party in Poland. Others have compared him to former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, or Mr Trump.
There are parallels. Like Mr Trump, Mr Babis is a very wealthy business insider, who rebranded himself as a political outsider and successfully ran against the establishment. Mr Babis owns the Agrofert agro-food conglomerate, the fourth-largest firm in the Czech Republic by revenue, and has a net personal worth of around US$3.3bn. Like Mr Berlusconi, he has used his private wealth and company infrastructures to develop his own party. ANO was launched as an anti-corruption initiative in 2011 and rose from obscurity in the 2013 election to become the second-largest party in parliament. Mr Babis has also supported his political ambitions through media holdings, acquiring the MAFRA group, which publishes two of the five big Czech national daily newspapers, in 2013.
Although he presents himself as a non-ideological results-oriented reformer, some of Mr Babis's public pronouncements have had authoritarian overtones. He has suggested on several occasions that the Czech Republic should be run like a company or a family firm, and has shown an obvious impatience with democratic procedures, repeatedly expressing frustration at the slowness of cabinet and parliamentary debates. In an accidentally recorded conversation, he told the Hungarian ambassador that he envied Mr Orban's freedom to make rapid, unchallenged decisions.
Mr Babis's position has led to a unique concentration of political, economic and media power-already evident in numerous conflict of interest scandals during his tenure as finance minister, which political opponents have sought to capitalise on. Mr Babis appears for now to have side-stepped the conflict of interest law passed in November by an ad hoc alliance of government and opposition parties, in the teeth of ANO opposition. The legislation, which bars ministers from holding a stake of over 40% in a company or any stake in a media outlet, has forced Mr Babis to transfer his assets into a trust fund. The lesson that he is likely to draw from this is that he needs to take a tougher stance against the established parties to pre-empt further measures being taken against him. In a future government ANO might therefore seek to exert stronger party-political control over key ministries, including the Ministry of the Interior, and sponsor counter-reforms targeting, for example, the financing of established parties (which tend to be more reliant on donations and public funding than ANO).
Limits to Babis
Mr Babis is, however, no populist nationalist, and even if the election in October delivers him a big win, there will be limits to his power. Born in Slovakia, and with a family and professional background that include close ties to the former communist regime, Mr Babis would be implausible in the role of a Czech nationalist. His politics, and those of his movement-although ill-defined-are broadly centrist, technocratic and pro-business. Mr Babis's picks for the cabinet posts held by ANO in the current government have consisted of middle-of-the-road technocrats and businesspeople (sometime recruited from Agrofert), not figures from the political fringes.
Moreover, ANO draws its support from a broad swathe of Czech society with surprisingly little differentiation by income, region or age. Research suggests that such middling voters are not particularly poor, angry or frustrated, but see ANO pragmatically as the "least bad" option, preferable to the older, established parties, which have had a patchy record in government and eventually succumbed to behind-the-scenes corruption scandals. Such voters value the buoyant economy that Mr Babis can claim to have delivered as finance minister. Many seem prepared to overlook Mr Babis's conflicts of interest on the grounds that he is a what-you-see-is-what-you-get politician, whose vast business empire is at least largely in plain sight. However, it is questionable whether such voters would continue to support Mr Babis-or the other ANO parliamentarians-if they launched a direct assault on the Czech Republic's liberal institutions.
ANO is also likely to find its power restricted in practice by its coalition partner or partners; its weak position in the Senate (which will remain controlled by other parties); and, if Milos Zeman loses (or does not contest) the presidential election in January 2018, the possibility of a new head of state who is less favourably disposed towards Mr Babis and ANO than the incumbent.
Policy outlook
The policy outlook for an ANO-led government remains for the moment unclear, with the movement planning to publish an electoral programme mid-year. As ANO's policymaking structures are comparatively weak, this programme is likely to reflect Mr Babis's own personal preferences.
The indications so far are that, as in 2013, Mr Babis will present ANO as a competent team of non-politicians focused on improving the public administration and fighting corruption-although, as at present, reforms will focus only on sectors that do not affect his political or business interests, and will ignore his own conflicts of interest. Czech media commentary suggest that ANO is likely to offer personal tax cuts and measures to support middle-income earners, especially in the public sector.
Both ANO and its leader have traditionally had a low profile in foreign and European affairs, preferring to focus on domestic reform. In the past Mr Babis has made inconsistent on-the-hoof pronouncements on issues such as euro adoption and EU refugee policy, designed primarily to play to Czech public opinion. An ANO-led government would be likely to follow a foreign policy focusing on Czech (economic) interests within the EU, but without developing any broader vision of Europe.
Political outlook: Intra-regional tensions
Political tensions in the region are at their highest since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In March 2014 Russia annexed Crimea and has since been providing military support to pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. In July 2014 the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, killing hundreds of EU citizens on board, was a decisive factor in the EU's decision to impose sector-wide sanctions on Russia's financial, defence and energy sectors. These sanctions may have discouraged Russia from significantly expanding the scope of the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The Minsk ceasefire agreement has led to a decline in the intensity of the conflict, but the line of contact between the government forces and Russian-backed military remains militarised. We think that EU sanctions against Russia will be renewed again in July 2017, but they may be eased over the medium term.
Russia is steadfastly opposed to EU and NATO expansion in the post-Soviet space (although the prospects for further enlargement of either bloc currently look very low). Unexpected political change in any country of the former Soviet Union has the potential to lead to an international crisis.
Policy-related tensions remain high within the euro zone, but the risk of their prompting a breakdown in inter-governmental relations has fallen sharply over the past year, as economic growth has picked up across the bloc. The European Central Bank (ECB) has successfully overcome objections in a number of countries-notably in Germany-to its use of unconventional policy instruments. However, the breathing space created by the ECB's programme of sovereign quantitative easing is not being used by political leaders to bolster the economic recovery with a strong united position on fiscal policy and structural reform. This has led to a potentially destabilising escalation of anti-establishment political sentiment across much of the bloc. This trend is generating increased pressure for economic policymaking that is focused on national considerations rather than on the integrity of the euro zone, creating new centrifugal forces at a time when policymakers are already struggling to remedy the institutional shortcomings of the single currency. Huge political capital has been invested in keeping the euro zone together in recent years. This should ensure its survival in the short term, but the risk of a partial break-up in the medium term remains significant. We attach a 60% probability to Greece leaving the euro zone during our five-year forecast period.
Tension between Turkey and the EU will remain high
Just weeks before the failed military coup in Turkey the AKP government had initiated efforts to mend badly damaged relations with Israel and Russia, as part of what appeared to be a broader push to reduce Turkey's growing international isolation brought on by years of assertive partisan foreign policy. But the failed military coup and the government's uncompromising response have further complicated Turkey's relations with other countries in the region, especially the EU. Following the failed coup, tensions erupted with the EU over the bloc's perceived lack of solidarity with Turkey and its rush to criticise the measures taken by the Turkish government to restore stability. Relations have deteriorated even further in recent months.
Since January 2017 tensions with Greece have escalated over Cyprus, disputed islands in the Aegean and the Greek courts' rejection of Turkey's application for the extradition of Turkish military officers who fled to Greece after the July 2016 coup attempt. In the first half of March 2017 a war of words erupted with the Netherlands and Germany over their refusal to allow Turkish government ministers to hold rallies in their countries in favour of Turkey's presidential reform referendum. The deterioration could eventually lead to the formal suspension of Turkey's EU accession negotiations and an end to Turkey's collab-oration with the EU to stem the inflow of migrants and refugees into Europe.
Neither Turkey nor the EU is genuinely interested in Turkish membership of the EU anymore, but we believe that Turkey is unlikely to suspend negotiations unilaterally. If Turkey reintroduces the death penalty, as Mr Erdogan has suggested since the failed coup, it may become unavoidable for the EU to suspend the process. Our baseline forecast has been that the death penalty is unlikely to be reinstated, but this cannot be ruled out given the government's increasingly hardline nationalist stance. An agreement on a solution to end the de facto division of Cyprus between the Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north could help to improve Turkey's relations with the EU, but we believe that a settlement is unlikely during the forecast period. The EU needs to continue working with Turkey, albeit on a transactional basis, to prevent the country from walking away from the migrant deal signed in March 2016. For his part, Mr Erdogan will continue to benefit domestically by demonising the EU. Condemnation of the bloc helps to stir up nationalist sentiment and increase his political standing with voters.
Turkey's hopes of a reset of relations with the US are misplaced
Under the administration of Mr Trump, we expect that US-Turkey ties will be strained and typified by numerous breakdowns, disappointing the Turkish government's expectations of closer collaboration. Mr Trump's relationship with Mr Erdogan will be largely transactional, with a weakly defined approach to achieving the shared goal of defeating Islamic State (IS). Mr Trump is unlikely to prioritise Turkey's two main concerns: opposition to US support for Syrian Kurdish groups also fighting IS and Turkey's request for the extradition from the US of Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric whose supporters are accused of masterminding the failed military coup in July 2016. Anti-US sentiment remains strong in Turkey but has been kept at bay by the silence of the Turkish government and media, in spite of Mr Trump's so-called Muslim ban and his use of terminology such as "radical Islamist terrorists" as a justification for the ban. This restraint is unlikely to last long if Mr Erdogan feels that Turkey's concerns are not being addressed adequately.
Political outlook: Will the US relax sanctions on Russia?
Donald Trump, the newly inaugurated president of the US, has spoken on several occasions of his desire to improve relations with Russia. This has raised the prospect that he might relax the sectoral sanctions imposed on Russia in response to its annexation of Crimea and military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Mr Trump does not require congressional approval to lift sanctions; however, there are significant impediments to such a move. The security and political establishment is overwhelmingly against the relaxation of sanctions on Russia, and some cabinet appointees have taken a hawkish line in their congressional confirmation hearings. However, Mr Trump's early days in office suggest that the president might be willing to make radical and controversial foreign policy moves.
The final months of Barack Obama's presidency were marked by a further deterioration in relations with Russia. In late December 2016 the US intelligence agencies released a report suggesting that Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, had directed Russian hacking of the US presidential election, reportedly initially to discredit the process and subsequently to help Mr Trump. On December 29th, in the wake of the intelligence report, Mr Obama ordered wide-ranging measures against Russian diplomats and intelligence officers in the US. He ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomatic personnel based in Washington DC and San Francisco, as well as the closure of two compounds used by the Russian embassy, in New York state and Maryland, and he put sanctions on Russian foreign military intelligence (GRU) and the Federal Security Service (FSB), as well as four GRU officers and three companies suspected of supporting the GRU's cyber operations.
Russia hopes for improved relations
Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs drew up a list of reciprocal sanctions that envisaged expelling 35 US diplomats and closing two facilities used by the US embassy; however, on December 30th Mr Putin declined to follow the recommendation in the hope that relations could improve under Mr Trump. Mr Trump's "America First" approach to international affairs could imply a major shift in US policy vis-à-vis Russia and eastern Europe. Mr Trump has expressed scepticism about the value of US alliances in Europe, described NATO as an "obsolete" organisation, and appeared to downplay Russia's military intervention in Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea.
Mr Trump's isolationist rhetoric has been welcomed by the Russian government. The Russian president has done little to discourage hopes of a fundamentally new relationship with the US under Mr Trump. In his customary year-end press conference Mr Putin expressed confidence that the two men could put bilateral relations on a more positive footing and noted that many Americans saw the world in similar terms to Russians, which was why (he claimed) Mr Trump had won the election. Senior parliamentarians have expressed similar expectations, although the president's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on December 21st that Russia did not expect any rapid change of US position on NATO's push eastward or sanctions on Russia. On January 22nd Dmitry Medvedev, the prime minister, said that he did not expect sanctions to be lifted soon.
Can a deal be done?
Mr Trump's desire to improve relations with Russia has raised the prospect that he might relax sanctions on the country. He has the option of eradicating most of the Ukraine-related sanctions at the stroke of a pen, because they were established by executive order. However, the new president likes to characterise himself as a deal-maker and to project an image of uncompromising strength. It therefore appears unlikely that he will relax sanctions unless he can present it as part of a broader bilateral deal that offers clear benefits to the US.
On January 15th Mr Trump suggested that he would consider relaxing sanctions on Russia in exchange for co-operation in fighting terrorism and achieving other goals. However, he also stated that the sanctions would remain in place "at least for a period of time". Mr Trump held his first telephone call as president with Mr Putin on January 28th. The readout from these calls did not directly refer to sanctions, but the Russian statement noted that both parties "stressed the importance of rebuilding mutually beneficial trade".
Mr Trump has signalled the possibility of a broad-ranging deal with Russia to end the dispute over Ukraine, scale back NATO and abandon US efforts to oust the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, in order to focus jointly with Russia on exterminating Islamic State (IS) in Syria and Iraq. However, the impediments to such a grand bilateral deal remain substantial. Although the two leaders seem to be in broad agreement on Syria, they are at odds regarding the Iran nuclear deal and North Korea's efforts to extend its nuclear-strike capability. It is also unclear whether closer co-operation between the US and Russia would be sufficient to secure a resolution of the intractable conflict in Syria or to deliver meaningful additional progress in tackling international terrorism.
Constraining factors?
Any move to undermine NATO or reduce US security engagement in Europe-two of the biggest concerns for Russia-will be strongly opposed by large parts of the US security establishment and Congress. There also appears to be no unity of opinion on Russia within Mr Trump's team. Rex Tillerson, Mr Trump's secretary of state, and James Mattis, the new secretary of defence, were both critical of Russia in their congressional confirmation hearings. Shortly after his appointment Mr Mattis told other members of the alliance that the US had an "unshakeable commitment to NATO".
The publication on January 10th of an uncorroborated dossier compiled by a former British intelligence agent has drawn attention to allegations of close ties between Mr Trump and some of his advisers and Russian officials. Mr Trump has strongly refuted the claims set out in the dossier, but at a press conference on January 11th he conceded that Russia was probably responsible for the hacking of the Democratic National Committee during the election campaign. In February Mr Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced to resign after revelations emerged that he had lied about discussions he held with the Russian ambassador before being appointed to the national security post. The heads of the US security services are due to testify to Congress over links between Russia and Mr Trump's election campaign. The controversy surrounding the issue may limit Mr Trump's room for manoeuvre and make it more difficult for him to improve relations with Russia-in the light of the controversy, any concession on sanctions could be viewed as being driven by personal rather than national interests.
Outlook
The likelihood of a relaxation of US sectoral sanctions on Russia has undoubtedly risen since Mr Trump's election. The outlook is now finely balanced and complicated by the contradictory policy views held by various members of Mr Trump's team. We now believe that Mr Trump is likely to relax some sanctions on Russia over the course of his presidency, although in the first instance this might be limited to a lifting of measures on some individuals or a reversal of the measures taken against the GRU and FSB by Mr Obama in the final days of his presidency.
We continue to believe there remains a significant risk that, following a brief period of thaw, bilateral relations could again worsen. The institutional basis for an improvement in relations is shaky and the countries share few common interests. Mr Trump is not the first president to seek to improve ties with Russia-Mr Obama and George Bush, another former US president, also tried to reset relations at the start of their administrations. In both cases relations had deteriorated significantly by the end of their terms in office. If the new president were to lift sanctions, it cannot be entirely excluded that the legislature might impose its own.
Political outlook: Economic policy
With a conservative fiscal bias prevailing across most of the region, policy-makers continue to rely on interest rates and unconventional monetary policy tools as the main levers with which to manage their economies. This creates a significant degree of exposure to the impact of the monetary policy cycle in the US, where The Economist Intelligence Unit expects further tightening over the forecast period (2017-21). The current reliance on monetary policy will also continue to exacerbate strains between monetary and fiscal policymakers, with the European Central Bank (ECB) in particular continuing to express concerns about the lack of heavy lifting in fiscal policy.
The UK has begun to alter its policy framework following its EU referendum
The UK faces particularly stark economic policy challenges following its decision in a referendum on June 23rd to withdraw from the EU. Leaving the EU will represent a break with decades of settled policy and, depending on how negotiations with the remaining member states proceed, may require a major reconfiguration of the country's regional and global trade, investment and migration ties. Monetary policy in the UK has already been loosened in response to the referendum result, and the government has taken some steps to address structural weaknesses, such as poor productivity growth, which have held the UK economy back in recent years. Such policy action seeks to pre-empt the risk that the UK's structural deficiencies might worsen either as a result of the economic fallout from the Brexit vote, or as a result of its implications for future trade and immigration.
Another country in which the overall economic policy framework is clouded by uncertainty is Turkey, where long-standing concerns about the policy-making implications of political instability have deepened following the failed coup attempt on July 15th and subsequent government crackdown. Structural reforms needed to improve Turkey's competitiveness have been on the government agenda but have yet to materialise. The failed coup has increased uncertainty further, leaving the Central Bank of Turkey-led by the governor, Murat Cetinkaya-and the deputy prime minister with responsibility for economic affairs, Mehmet Simsek, to try to reassure investors that macro-economic stability will be maintained. Domestic political instability and the prospect of tighter global liquidity as a result of expectations of higher US interest rates following the election of Donald Trump as US president has put the Turkish lira under severe pressure. A modest interest-rate rise by the Central Bank of Turkey in November, followed by the government's announcement of a package of measures to boost flagging economic growth, has had a limited impact on the Turkish currency. If it continues to depreciate at its current pace, the Central Bank may have to raise rates much more sharply. An abrupt tightening of policy could strangle Turkey's already fragile economic growth.
In Russia, the fall in oil prices, which led to a significant contraction in real GDP and household consumption, has underlined the imperative for reforms to encourage investment and diversification away from commodity exports. Two competing centres of expertise, one under Aleksei Kudrin, a former minister of finance, and the other centred around the Stolypin Group, headed by Boris Titov, the business ombudsman, have put forward contrasting proposals for structural reforms. We do not expect significant reforms to be undertaken before the presidential election in 2018. Following the re-election of Vladimir Putin, the incumbent, economic policy will continue to prioritise social and political stability, and we expect state involvement in the economy to remain substantial. Reform of the tax system and a gradual rise in the pension age appear likely. Institutional reform to strengthen the rule of law and protection for businesses looks much more difficult to achieve.

Data based on national definitions.
We expect fiscal consolidation to exert a much less powerful drag on growth over the forecast period compared with the preceding five years. Most governments in the region have completed the majority of the fiscal repair that they embarked upon in response to the financial crisis. Almost all European countries improved their fiscal positions in 2009-15, with the star performers being Ireland (+11.9 percentage points of GDP), Iceland and Lithuania (+8.9), and Greece (+7.6). However, significant fiscal loosening remains off the cards for most, owing to the rigidity of the rules agreed by EU members at the height of the euro zone crisis. Although fiscal retrenchment has been painful and severe in much of the continent, many countries have little to show for it. Years of gaping deficits, weak or negative nominal GDP growth and (in some cases) expensive bank bail-outs have seen public debt/GDP ratios spike in a large number of states. Hefty public debt loads will remain a challenge for much of the euro zone for many years, although the cost of debt servicing has fallen owing to the exceptionally low interest rates that currently prevail across the bloc.
The UK's vote to leave the EU has transformed the fiscal outlook
Downward revisions to economic growth forecasts since the Brexit vote have made the UK government's previous target of achieving a budget surplus by the end of the current parliament (2020) even less feasible than before. Official projections released in March 2017 show the general government deficit widening marginally in the current fiscal year (2017/18) before narrowing throughout the forecast period, but remaining in deficit in 2021/22. The chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, aims to return the budget to balance "as early as possible" in the next parliament. This new target leaves some fiscal room for manoeuvre, although this will be undermined in the event that the economic fallout from Brexit is more severe than expected. We forecast that the deficit will widen to 4% of GDP in 2017, from an estimated 3.7% in 2016, as automatic stabilisers push up spending on social transfers as unemployment increases. However, revenue will still be rising, and in 2018-21 the government will aim to nudge down discretionary spending as a proportion of GDP. We expect the deficit to have narrowed to about 2% of GDP by 2021. We estimate that the public debt burden reached 91% of GDP in 2016, and will peak at about 95% by 2019, before falling thereafter.
Within the EU, over the past year a number of national governments have shown signs of pushing back against centralised fiscal constraints, which have become significantly more rigorous as a result of changes introduced in response to the crisis. Renewed tension between member states and the European Commission, which enforces the EU's budgetary rules, are now coming to a head. In early July 2016 the Commission proposed that Spain and Portugal should be fined for their failure to meet deficit targets in 2015. Although the Commission ultimately stepped back from this position, the episode highlighted the growing tension between the strict fiscal rules agreed at the height of the crisis and the mounting political and economic arguments within member states for a greater degree of fiscal flexibility.
The fiscal position has deteriorated across the former Soviet Union
The steep fall in commodity prices and the sharp reduction in export demand and remittance inflows from Russia caused a significant deterioration in economic conditions across the former Soviet Union in 2015-16. This has contributed to a general deterioration in the fiscal picture across the region. The three major former Soviet Union oil exporters-Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Russia-were particularly hard hit and drew down on reserves in their sovereign wealth funds to cover wider budget deficits and/or maintain investment as bank lending fell. All three countries have announced privatisation programmes to plug funding gaps, but we remain sceptical about the scope and pace of these plans. Russia completed the sale of a 19.5% stake in Rosneft, a major oil producer, in December 2016; however, the terms of the deal remain unclear and the state retains control of the company. Russia's financing challenges are acute, as international sanctions make it difficult for the country to increase foreign borrowing. The Russian Ministry of Finance has put forward ambitious austerity measures that, if implemented in full, would decrease spending by the equivalent of 2-3% of GDP in three years. We do not expect the ministry to succeed in holding expenditure steady in nominal terms in 2017-19, as it intends, in part owing to the presidential election in 2018. However, revenue planning has been set on the basis of a conservative oil price, and we therefore expect the budget deficit to gradually narrow to less than 2% of GDP by 2020.
Weak institutional structures, high inflation and rapid currency depreciation have limited the ability of many countries in the region to respond to the economic slowdown with an expansive fiscal policy. Tajikistan, which has experienced a serious banking crisis, is likely either to seek funding from the IMF or further bilateral support from China or Russia (the Russian-backed Eurasian Bank released the first of two US$20m tranches of financial support in August 2016, with the second due in the fourth quarter of this year). The most notable exception in Central Asia is Kazakhstan, which is drawing on its substantial reserves to implement an ambitious counter-cyclical spending programme to offset the impact of falling household demand. The country avoided recession in 2016, recording real GDP growth of 1.3%. This is nevertheless significantly below the average growth rate of the past ten years.
Political outlook: The spring budget: the chancellor's U-turn
In the UK's final spring budget, delivered by the chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, on March 8th the government restated its aim of preparing the country for its future outside the EU. Addressing weak productivity and promoting "fairness" are major objectives, to which end there will be a new effort to improve vocational skills.
As expected, additional funding was allocated to social care and there was targeted relief for businesses facing higher business rates. However, the chancellor was forced to make a swift U-turn on his proposal to fund these measures through an increase in national insurance contributions (NICs) from the self-employed, after this met with staunch opposition.
Compared with its previous forecast, in November, the UK's independent fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), expects real GDP to grow at a faster pace in 2017, but at a slower pace in 2018-20.
Fiscal projections from the OBR see lower public-sector net borrowing in fiscal year 2016/17, but as this is down to one-off factors the public borrowing profile is broadly the same thereafter. Public-sector net debt will begin to fall as a share of GDP from 2018/19.
The budget was short of ground-breaking measures, with the chancellor likely to wait until the autumn budget-now the centrepiece of the fiscal year-to deliver bigger reforms, particularly as some uncertainty related to the Brexit process should have receded by then.
Mr Hammond's rhetoric was more forceful than the measures that he announced in the budget, partly because the government had already made more sizeable spending commitments in the autumn statement last November, as part of its strategy to boost the economy's resilience to Brexit. The chancellor reiterated that the government was aiming to build a "stronger, fairer and more global Britain" in order to prepare the country for "a global future" outside the EU. This strategy begins with tackling the causes of low productivity growth, which have held back the UK's economic recovery since the global financial crisis.
Renewed focus on vocational skills, but no big surprises
Having announced a National Productivity Investment Fund worth £23bn (US$28bn) last November, which was mainly directed at greater spending on infrastructure and innovation, there was a renewed focus on the need for investment in skills and education in this budget, with the chancellor noting that too many young people lack the skills that they need for the modern labour market. This will be addressed with a £260m (US$316m) investment in existing schools over the next three years, an extension of the free schools programme, the introduction of "T-Levels", which will provide focused routes to technical careers (as compared with "A-levels" in academia), and free transport for children travelling far to attend selective schools. Mr Hammond said that changes in this area were designed not only to boost productivity but also to promote fairness.
Most of the remaining measures announced in the budget were widely anticipated. Over the next three years, £2.4bn of additional funding will be provided for social care and £510m for the National Health Service (NHS). Mr Hammond responded to pressure from businesses and backbench members of parliament (MPs) to provide targeted relief for those facing an increase in business rates when these are revalued in April: a £305m fund will be provided for local councils to offer discretionary relief for hard-hit cases, there will be additional support for those in receipt of small business rate relief and in 2017/18 small pubs will get a £1,000 (US$1,216) discount on the business rates bill.
A forced U-turn on rise in self-employed NICs
In order to fund these measures, Mr Hammond proposed to level the playing field across different forms of employment, by reducing the "unfair discrepancy" between the total tax paid by an employed worker and that paid by those who set up their own companies. However, by proposing to raise NICs for the self-employed, by 1% in both 2018/19 and 2019/20, taking the rate to 11% (still below the employee rate of 12%), he broke a Conservative Party manifesto promise, causing uproar among Conservative MPs and supporters. Forced to make a swift U-turn, Mr Hammond will have to find alternative revenue of £2bn for social spending increases through to 2021/22. Headline tax increases are not politically feasible, but the sum is rather modest, and a combination of a spending squeeze and stealth tax rises would probably suffice.
Mr Hammond plans to raise £820m over this period through new measures to tackle tax non-compliance and a further £2.6bn through a reduction in the tax-free dividend allowance for directors and shareholders, to £2,000, from £5,000, in 2018/19-another measure aimed at promoting fairness. Mr Hammond announced that the government's "sugar tax" was raising less than expected in revenue because producers had responded by reducing the amount of sugar in their drinks, so a new minimum excise duty will be placed on cigarettes.
For consumers, set to see real incomes eroded by rising inflation in 2017-18, Mr Hammond noted that in April the personal allowance would be rising for the seventh consecutive year, to £11,500, with the higher-rate threshold rising to £45,000, and said that the government would meet its manifesto promise to increase these thresholds to £12,500 and £50,000 respectively by the end of the current parliament. The government will be publishing a green paper on consumer protection to help "ordinary working people".
Finally, Mr Hammond said that he had reached a deal with the mayor of London on further devolution, and announced £350m in additional funds for the Scottish government, £200m for the Welsh government and almost £120m for an incoming Northern Ireland executive, adding that the country was "stronger together".
Lower borrowing, briefly
The economy gathered momentum in the second half of 2016, and in response the OBR revised up its forecast for real GDP growth in 2017, to 2%, from 1.4% forecast after the autumn statement in November. Mr Hammond said that the resilience in the economy last year had been reflected in the labour market, and that the positive employment trend was set to continue over the OBR's forecast period. However, the OBR's new growth profile sags from 2018 onwards, when the pace of real GDP growth is forecast to slow to 1.6%, before picking up to 1.7% in 2019 and 1.9% in 2020. This compares with a previous OBR forecast of 1.7% real GDP growth in 2018 and 2.1% on average in 2019-20.
Stronger than expected growth in tax receipts in 2016 mean that the government is on course to undershoot its fiscal target for 2016/17, set in November, and so it has been revised down by £16.4bn, to £51.7bn. However, the OBR assessed that this revision reflected short-term factors that would not lead to a fundamental improvement in the public finances, and as a result the borrowing profile returns to its previous projection in 2017/18, with a slightly faster decline forecast in 2018/19 and 2019/20. This occurs despite the downward revision to growth in these years, owing to the net impact of measures announced in the budget. As before, however, big spending cuts in the final two fiscal years of the forecast period-largely reflecting departmental spending limits but also lower spending on welfare-pull the borrowing total down to just below £19bn on average.
The OBR still forecasts that public-sector net debt will begin to fall as a share of GDP from 2018/19, after peaking at 88.8% in 2017/18, although this is slightly lower than the 90.2% peak forecast in November. The debt/GDP ratio also ends the forecast period at just below 80% in 2021/22, a downward revision from 81.6% previously. This largely reflects lower cumulative borrowing during the forecast period, but also changes to the way that the OBR has modelled the accounting effect of future asset purchases made under the Asset Purchase Facility of the Bank of England (BoE, the central bank), because as maturing government bonds are rolled over the new purchases tend to have lower coupons than the ones that they replace.
Small steps in the right direction
The budget was unsurprisingly cautious. The government will trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty on March 29th-giving formal notification of the UK's intention to withdraw from the EU-and so is taking a cautious approach to the public finances, making only small tweaks to taxes and spending plans that are broadly fiscally neutral. The chancellor may be holding back on announcing big reforms until late 2017, when the autumn statement will be replaced by a full autumn budget, which will serve as the big fiscal event of the year. Some uncertainty about the UK's future relationship with the EU may have receded by then, encouraging the chancellor to make bolder changes.
Nevertheless, further steps were taken to address the root causes of weak productivity in this budget, with the government switching its focus to the UK's vocational skills deficit. However, as with the National Productivity Investment Fund, although the measures represent steps in the right direction they are probably too modest in size and scope to invigorate the weak recovery in productivity and close the UK's productivity gap with its peers. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), in 2014 output per hour in the UK was 18 percentage points below the average for the rest of the G7 economies. The risk also remains that a deterioration in the public finances as the UK withdraws from the EU will constrain the government's ability to extend this plan in the future, although Mr Hammond's aim to reach a budget surplus "as early as possible" after the next election will provide some flexibility.

In most of Europe monetary policy remains exceptionally accommodative and will continue to do so throughout the forecast period. This is particularly the case in the EU, where the bloc's bias towards tight fiscal policy puts an unusual degree of pressure on the monetary authorities. We do not expect either the ECB or the Bank of England (BoE, the UK central bank) to increase rates in 2017-21.
We expect tapering of the ECB's QE programme to begin in 2018
Amid heightened political risk, the euro zone economy is showing increasing momentum, and we expect another healthy expansion in the region's economy this year, after growth of 1.8% on average in 2015-16. Nonetheless, the ECB is continuing to pursue an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero, a series of so-called targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) aimed at pushing banks to lend more money and an EUR80bn (US$85bn) per month quantitative easing (QE) programme, which will fall to EUR60bn per month from April until end-2017.
The ECB's president, Mario Draghi, emphasised that the reduction in the pace of QE was designed to sustain the bank's presence in the market for a longer period than if purchases continued at the current rate, and should not be viewed as "tapering", which would signify a winding down of the programme. We expect tapering to begin in 2018, but downside risks to global growth during that year, including our forecast for an economic slowdown in China and tighter monetary policy in the US, suggest that the pace at which the ECB unwinds its accommodative policy stance will be gradual. We maintain our forecast that the ECB will not tighten policy rates before the end of our five-year forecast period, in 2021.
The Bank of England has loosened policy following the EU referendum
The BoE took several steps in 2016 to limit the financial and economic fallout from the Brexit vote. First, the bank's financial policy committee reduced the countercyclical buffer rate from 0.5% of banks' UK exposures to zero and made additional funds available to support market functioning. In August 2016 the bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) announced a package of stimulus measures designed to forestall a deterioration in economic conditions. The package of measures included four main changes:
a 25-basis-point cut to the policy rate, from 0.5% to 0.25%;
a £60bn (US$75bn) increase in the BoE's holding of government bonds under its QE programme, which will now total £435bn;
a £10bn purchase of corporate bonds; and
a new Term Funding Scheme (TFS), which is designed to boost commercial banks' lending.
A rapid depreciation of the pound has exacerbated inflationary pressure, and inflation is likely to overshoot its 2% target in 2017. At its meeting on March 16th 2017 the BoE's MPC kept policy unchanged, with the main interest rate at 0.25% and the stock of government bond purchases at £435bn. One member of the eight-member MPC voted to increase the policy rate by 25 basis points. Some MPC members said that "it would take relatively little further upside news" to prompt them to support a rate increase. However, with the economy set to lose some momentum in the second half of this year, unanimous support for a rate rise is still likely to be some way off.
Amid bouts of volatility, sterling has been on a generally depreciating trend since the Brexit vote in June 2016, reflecting investor unease about the implications of the vote. Financial market uncertainty is likely to persist, and we forecast that sterling will depreciate further against the US dollar and the euro this year. The depreciation against the dollar will be larger than against the euro (at about 11% and 8% respectively), as the dollar is supported by rapid economic growth in the US and monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank). However, we expect the pound to make a gradual recovery against the dollar in the final years of the forecast period, owing to our forecast of a recession in the US and monetary easing by the Fed in 2019.
Policy to be kept tight to support the Turkish lira and lower inflation
We expect that in the coming months the Central Bank of Turkey will have to tighten monetary policy further to re-assert its independence from political pressure to lower interest rates to revive economic activity, and at the same time to prevent a further depreciation of the lira amid expectations of higher US interest rates. We expect the bank to use a mix of interest-rate rises, macro-prudential measures and other policies. Having steadily lowered interest rates in May-September 2016, the Central Bank has raised most of its main policy rates since November 2016 and has increasingly provided funding to the banking sector at its previously little-used "late liquidity window" overnight lending rate, which has been raised by a total of 200 basis points, to 11.75% in mid-March. Since November 2016, the weighted average cost of the Central Bank's funds to the banking system has risen from 7.8%, to 11.3% in mid-March 2017.
The Central Bank is seeking gradually to normalise its monetary policy frame-work to establish a single policy interest rate, the one-week repurchase lending rate, which would help to improve transparency regarding monetary policy decisions. However, it is unlikely that the corridor of interest rates that the bank has been using to vary the cost of funds to the banking system will be eliminated until inflation is more firmly on a downward path towards its medium-term target of 5% and domestic political uncertainty eases. From 2017 the bank will hold only eight regular MPC meetings annually rather than 12.
The Turkish lira has been highly volatile and on a sharply depreciating path against all major currencies since September 2016. Amid further bouts of volatility, we expect the lira to depreciate against the US dollar to an annual average of TL3.84:US$1 in 2017, a fall of 21%. In 2018-21 we forecast that the exchange rate will remain broadly stable in real terms, depreciating in nominal terms to an average of TL4.08:US$1 in 2021.
Inflationary pressures have weakened in Russia in early 2016
In Russia, inflation averaged 15.5% in 2015, as the sharp depreciation of the rouble in the final quarter of 2014 fed through into high import prices. A combination of weak demand and relatively tight monetary policy by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) led to significant disinflation in 2016; over the year as a whole, inflation averaged 7%.
The CBR has been relatively successful in overcoming the impact of cost-push inflation linked to depreciation of the rouble, helped by a strong harvest in 2016 and rouble appreciation in the second half of the year. In the medium term, however, the major role played by the oil price in determining the terms of trade and inflation expectations will continue to complicate monetary policy. In addition, the CBR's job is made more difficult by rigidities in the labour market, low competition in some sectors and the limited size of the financial sector. These factors may make it harder to maintain stable and low inflation (particularly in the case of a poor domestic harvest, given the restrictions on food imports from many Western states). Administratively-controlled prices for many services and the rate of indexation of transfers play a large role in shaping inflation expectations, and lie beyond the control of the CBR. The CBR may resume monetary loosening as early as June 2017, but real interest rates are likely to remain positive throughout the forecast period. We forecast that the policy rate will be cut to 8.5-9% by end-2017. The CBR governor, Elvira Nabiullina, has suggested that an appropriate level for the real interest rate would be about 2.5-3% when inflation moves close to the CBR's 4% target. Although the CBR is under pressure from some policymakers to loosen monetary policy, the bank's management appears to have the support of the presidential administration in maintaining a relatively tight policy.
For those central and east European countries with currencies that are pegged to or managed against the euro (mostly in the western Balkans), risks of volatility have moved in line with expectations of Fed tightening. However, we do not see significant risks to the currency boards in Bosnia and Hercegovina or Bulgaria, or to the peg in Macedonia. Croatia had been more of a concern, in the light of the 2015 legislation to force banks to convert Swiss franc-denominated loans into euro. However, the country's improved external and fiscal positions, and increased demand for the kuna as a result of the record tourism season, have driven appreciation, which we forecast will continue, to an average of HRK7.48:EUR1 this year.
Currencies across the former Soviet Union depreciated sharply in 2015 as a result of the weakening of the rouble and lower oil prices (which has hit commodity exporters). Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan both officially abandoned their US dollar pegs in 2015. In practice, the commitment of both countries to a free float would be seriously tested in the event of further oil volatility. We would expect the central banks of both countries to intervene, at least temporarily, in such a scenario to prevent sharp fluctuations in the currency and maintain financial and monetary stability.
The Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) had to grapple with a serious banking crisis in 2016 and struggled to restore confidence in the currency, the manat, following the devaluation in December 2015. Ten banks failed in 2016, which further undermined confidence in the banking system and encouraged a flight to the US dollar. In early 20177 the CBA made substantial foreign-exchange reserves from the State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ, the sovereign wealth fund) available to the central bank in an effort to restore confidence in the currency. This appears to have had a positive impact on sentiment. The manat stabilised and then appreciated against the dollar in the first quarter of 2017. We do not believe that the manat is overvalued, and with oil prices likely to average significantly higher than in 2016, the CBA may be able to escape the cycle of currency weakening, high inflation and financial instability that it experienced in 2016.
Non-commodity exporters' currencies should stabilise in 2017
The currencies of most non-commodity exporters should stabilise in 2017, as the main price adjustment from lower remittances from Russia and the weaker regional growth outlook has now taken place. However, the outlook remains uncertain-weaker than forecast commodity prices or a return to fighting in eastern Ukraine could trigger another bout of currency volatility in Russia, which will be transmitted to most of the regional economies. Currency volatility over the past year has led to the increased dollarisation of many economies in the region, which will hamper the effectiveness of monetary policy, and the ability of the central banks to stabilise inflation and output.

The UK economy has been resilient in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. However, rising cost pressures stemming from a weaker pound, combined with uncertainty about the Brexit negotiations and the UK's future relationship with the EU, are likely to weigh more heavily on economic activity later this year, and on investment spending in particular. The Economist Intelligence Unit therefore expects a slowdown in the pace of economic growth, from 1.8% in 2016 to 1.7% in 2017 and 1% per year in 2018-19. A deal on the UK's new trading relationship with the EU is likely to be phased in from 2019. We expect the pace of real GDP growth to rise to 2% by 2021.
The economic impact of the UK's vote to leave the EU on the wider regional economy could be substantial. In addition to the direct impact via trade and investment channels, over time the referendum result is also likely to compound centrifugal political and institutional dynamics in the EU and euro zone, which already militate against effective policymaking and which have contributed to the region's weak economic performance in recent years. That said, in the nine months since the UK voted to leave the EU, the impact on Europe's economy has been barely noticeable. A small dip in economy-wide confidence in July and August quickly reversed, and a modest recovery across the region has continued uninterrupted. Economic and political risks are likely to intensify in the course of 2017, once the UK government formally begins the process of withdrawing from the EU. The short-term economic fallout from Brexit will be modest for Europe, but the UK's departure will exacerbate weaknesses that have been holding back the region's economic recovery in recent years, particularly as EU leaders turn their attention away from domestic issues, such as reform efforts, and focus on negotiations with the UK.
The region's economic prospects are unusually affected at present by several external factors that have been dominating the global economic landscape. Two important such factors are the pace of monetary tightening in the US and the nature of the slowdown that is under way in China. On the first of these, we now expect the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank) to increase rates three times in 2017 (in line with the Fed's forward guidance) and twice in 2018. The election in November of Donald Trump as US president raised upside risks to economic growth in the country, and therefore increased the chance of a faster pace of monetary tightening by the Fed. However, we remain sceptical that the new administration will drive significantly faster US growth. In our view therefore, the path of Fed tightening is likely to remain gradual. This should ease pressure on a number of countries in the region-notably Turkey, Russia, Poland, Hungary, Georgia and Croatia-that are more exposed than others to the effects of Fed tightening. Although our central forecast is that the US business cycle will end in 2019, an external shock could bring it to a halt sooner. Unprecedented Fed policies have inflated asset prices, and a turn in investor sentiment could harm consumer and business confidence.
The Chinese economy has continued to defy gravity, with official data showing growth slowing smoothly, despite persistent inefficiencies in the state sector and recessionary conditions in the industrial north-east. However, we think that a hard landing is on the cards, and forecast that growth will lurch down from 6.4% in 2017 to 4.2% in 2018. This kind of shift is unprecedented in modern China and will come at a time when the global economy is uniquely unprepared to react. Consequently, 2018 will be a year of anxiety around the world, characterised by volatility in real economies and financial markets.

Outlook for the euro zone will remain challenging
Over the longer term the outlook for the single currency area will remain challenging, as demographic factors will begin to exert a more powerful drag on an increasing number of countries in the bloc. During the forecast period (2017-21) we expect policymakers to continue to try to remedy some of the euro zone's institutional shortcomings, but we do not expect them to find a game-changing solution. In particular, they are unlikely to reform the bloc's fiscal policy frame-work. This means that tensions will persist between member states over targets for budget deficits, and it is almost inconceivable that the bloc's fiscal authorities will significantly ease the pressure on their monetary counterparts by pursuing an actively expansionary policy.
We expect much of central and eastern Europe to face a slightly more challenging environment in the forecast period, particularly countries that have benefited from EU funding. A deadline at the end of 2015 for fund drawdowns from the EU's 2007-13 fiscal period brought an end to a surge in investment spending. Funding inflows for projects under the EU's 2014-20 funding period have not gained the same kind of momentum. Growth in Germany-a key market for these countries-will remain relatively solid, although the slowdown in China in 2018 will dampen external demand. Nonetheless, the German economy's changing structure, with investment and private consumption rising, will provide a boost to central and east European countries with strong trade links to their larger neighbour.
Within central and eastern Europe, there are significant divergences, and we expect these to persist. The Visegrad states-the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland-will see slower but still healthy growth rates in 2017-21, with low oil prices, significant trade integration with Germany, generally weighty and competitive external sectors (measured as exports relative to GDP), and a much smaller fiscal drag than previously supporting growth rates. Lower EU fund inflows as projects financed under the 2014-20 fiscal period get started will, however, weigh on growth this year. Growth in the Czech Republic-the star performer in 2015, with 4.6% growth-slowed to 2.3% in 2016 and is forecast at an average of 2.3% in 2017-21. In Slovakia, average growth will slow from 3.8% in 2015, but remain above 3% on average in 2017-21. In Hungary, growth slowed to 1.7% in 2016, from 3.1% in 2015, but is expected to pick up to an annual average of 2.4% in 2017-21. In Poland, we estimate that real GDP expansion slowed from 3.9% in 2015 to 2.8% in 2016, reflecting a deterioration in policy and a rise in political risk. We expect real GDP to expand at an average annual rate of 3.2% in 2017-21.
Economic activity is picking up in south-east Europe
In south-east Europe, the situation is generally improving after a protracted and difficult post-crisis recovery, with growth rates in the region set to overtake those of the Visegrad states and the Baltics in 2016-17. We expect continued strong real GDP growth in the region's biggest economy, Romania, which grew by 4.8% in 2016. We expect growth to average 3.4% per year in 2017-21. However, rapid wage growth is driving a consumer boom that is sucking in imports and inflating the current-account deficit, and a raft of tax cuts have widened the fiscal deficit. Bulgaria will also maintain the momentum established in 2015, with growth in 2017 expected to be 3.1%, after an expansion of 3.4% in 2016. This sustained pick-up is driven by improved performance in the euro zone, robust export performance and increased expenditure on infrastructure projects, which received a boost from a surge in the inflow of EU funds.
Growth in the western Balkans and Baltics to accelerate; Visegrad to slow
We forecast average real GDP growth in the western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Hercegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia) of 3.3% per year in 2017-18, up from an annual average of around 3% in 2015-16. This compares with our forecast of average real GDP growth of 3% per year in the Visegrad countries in 2017-18, which represents a slowdown from the 3.4% average real GDP growth recorded in 2015-16. Growth in the three Baltic states is forecast to increase from an average of 1.9% per year in 2015-16 to 2.8% per year on average in 2017-18.
Economic activity in the western Balkans has picked up in the past two years, reflecting a combination of favourable base effects and externally driven cyclical factors such as low oil prices. In 2015 private investment and exports were the main drivers of growth in Albania, Montengero and Serbia, with private consumption remaining weak, pointing to a more balanced growth trajectory. The region has undergone a significant economic adjustment in the years since the global economic crisis in 2007-09, largely correcting fiscal and current-account imbalances (with some notable exceptions, such as Montengero). Inflation has fallen to historical lows for the region, allowing a more accommodative monetary policy that has supported growth. The revival of investment is set to continue, and over the medium and long term the region should benefit from the structural reforms that are now under way in most countries. On the downside, slow progress on structural reforms, high public and/or private debt loads, and (in some cases) a continued large fiscal drag remain impediments to faster growth. We do not think that the fallout from the Brexit vote will be unduly negative for the Balkans, the slow progress of which towards EU membership is set to continue.
Croatia had been the worst-performing economy in the former communist region, averaging annual real GDP growth of -1.6% in 2009-15. It emerged from six years of recession in 2015 with growth of 1.6%. Growth accelerated to 2.9% in 2016, driven by private consumption and investment, and benefiting from favourable base effects and cyclical factors, including low international oil prices and a record tourism season. We forecast real GDP growth of 3.2% this year, as the negative effect on private consumption of lower real income growth will be offset by a slew of tax cuts and increases in minimum and public-sector wages. In 2018-21 we expect the economy to grow by an annual average of 2.6%-a reasonable rate of expansion compared with the rest of the region. Nevertheless, the economy will only reach its 2008 level towards the end of the forecast period. Croatia is still at a relatively early stage in the reform process and is working off the excesses of the pre-crisis years. The need to pay down large public- and private-sector debt, a deteriorating demographic picture, poor competitiveness and a subdued external outlook will all contribute to the weak trend growth rate.
Greece's economic recovery stalled in 2015 as a result of the negative effect of political uncertainty on business and consumer confidence, but the recession was not as bad as might have been expected, owing to another strong tourism sector performance, low oil prices, consumers' readiness to spend their savings rather than risk a haircut on household deposits, and a rise in electronic payments (reducing the shadow economy). Real GDP growth contracted by 0.3% (seasonally adjusted) and by 0.2% in unadjusted terms in 2015, and remained flat in 2016. We forecast modest real GDP growth of 1.2% this year. The prospects for the economy are gloomy, partly because of continued investor uncertainty and partly because of the negative effect on consumption of bail-out reforms. A triple combination of higher taxes, higher social security payments and debt repayments will put further pressure on disposable income.
Russia's economy will move into a recovery phase next year
Although low energy prices contributed to a modest recovery in EU growth in 2015, they triggered a deep recession across most of the former Soviet Union. Russia's real GDP, which remains an important driver of the regional economy, contracted by 2.8% in 2015. The recession persisted in 2016, as oil prices remained low and households and companies continued to deleverage. Household incomes declined in real terms for a second successive year. This was compounded by a contractionary fiscal policy. The weak banking sector and high political risk continued to depress investment. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan likewise faced the combined impact of contracting household and government expenditure and corporate deleveraging in 2016. Russian GDP fell by 0.2% in 2016. Kazakhstan's economy posted low growth of just 1.3%, and real GDP in Azerbaijan declined by 3.8%. The weakness of the Russian economy held down growth across the rest of the region, largely through low remittances and export demand.
Growth in Russia is expected to rebound moderately from 2017, driven by a recovery in commodity prices, which should encourage a strengthening of the rouble and household spending power. We expect the banking sector to start to stabilise, allowing for a modest recovery in investment. We forecast real GDP growth of 0.9%. Risks are broadly to the upside, given that the oil price is projected to be around 25% higher than in 2016. At the same time, there are a number of possible headwinds. The external political environment remains uncertain, and a further upsurge in tensions with the West cannot be excluded. Moreover, oil prices may remain lower than currently forecast. In the medium term, structural constraints-the weak institutional environment, poor demo-graphics and weak competition-will hold trend growth below 2% per year.
After the shocks of revolution and war, real GDP contracted by 9.9% in Ukraine in 2015. GDP grew by 2.2% in 2016, driven by a recovery in private consumption and investment. Subdued growth in Russia and restrictions on trade will limit the prospects for an export-led recovery. We forecast average annual growth of 2.6% in the medium term; however, there are significant downside risks. Our forecast assumes that there is slow but steady progress in reforming the economy and stabilising the political system, and that there is not a return to all-out war in eastern Ukraine. None of these are guaranteed. Ukraine's fiscal position remains precarious, and the potential for political instability to trigger an economic crisis is high.
In Turkey, domestic political instability, perceived security risks from terrorist attacks and uncertainty about the global economic outlook will have negative effects on the economy in the short and medium term. We expect real GDP growth to pick up only modestly, from an estimated 2.2% in 2016 to 2.4% in 2017. In 2018-21 we expect real GDP growth to average 3.4% per year, assuming that there is a gradual stabilisation of domestic conditions. By far the biggest risk to our growth forecast is the possibility of a severe disruption to capital inflows to Turkey.

Disinflationary pressures are beginning to unwind across the region
The slump in global oil prices in late 2014 exacerbated a marked disinflationary trend in Europe. Although demand conditions remain fragile in much of the region, we do not expect recent downward pressures on prices to lead to a damaging deflationary spiral. On the contrary, disinflationary trends provided a welcome boost to the region's real economy in 2015, and to a limited extent in 2016, as households benefited from higher real earnings and businesses from lower input costs. In aggregate terms, we expect price pressures to become firmer from 2017 and to remain below 2% by the end of the forecast period in much of the region. Base effects-notably those related to energy prices-will provide much of the initial impetus behind rising rates of inflation, as domestic demand will recover only slowly in many countries.
In a number of specific instances across the region, very different inflationary patterns will be recorded-Turkey, for example, will struggle throughout the forecast period to bring its inflation rate down to its 5% target. The stubbornness of price pressures in Turkey will largely reflect downward pressure on the lira, but in 2016 policy moves such as a sharp increase in the minimum wage will also contribute. Sharp devaluations of many former Soviet Union currencies pushed up prices significantly across the region in 2015, through imports. Price pressures eased in most countries of the region in 2016, and in 2017 we expect annual price inflation gradually to fall, on the back of weak demand, relative currency stability and subdued external price pressures. Inflation averaged 7% in Russia in 2016, down from 15.5% in 2015.
Economic forecast: Outlook for inflation in the euro zone
In February 2017, according to a flash estimate from Eurostat, EU harmonised inflation in the euro zone reached 2% year on year-its highest level since January 2013. This compares with a zero inflation rate on average across the region in 2015 and 0.2% in 2016.
Unwinding energy price base effects have pushed inflation higher, but core price pressures have remained relatively stable, reaching 0.9% in February 2017, compared with annual average rates of 0.8% in both 2015 and 2016.
These price dynamics will persist in 2017, producing a temporary spike in inflation early in the year. Thereafter, external factors such as a recent strong increase in global commodity prices and a weak euro are likely to feed into supply-chain cost pressures.
However, weak domestic demand will continue to constrain inflationary pressure, even as monetary policy becomes more accommodative. When the supply-side boost fades after 2017, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the upturn to flatten, with annual inflation averaging 1.6% in 2017 and 1.4% in 2018.
Given this outlook for inflation, we reaffirm our view that the European Central Bank (ECB) will not tighten policy rates before the end of our five-year forecast period, in 2021.
Annual inflation in the euro zone has risen consistently since April 2016, when it dipped to -0.2%. Trends in inflation across the region mainly reflect price changes in Germany, France and Italy-the countries with the three highest weightings in the aggregate inflation measure, collectively accounting for 66% of the total. Inflation rose particularly sharply in December 2016-February 2017 owing to annual inflation in Germany, which jumped by 1.5 percentage points, to 2.2%. In Italy, where price pressures have been particularly subdued, annual inflation rose by 1.5 percentage points, to 1.6%, in February. In France inflation edged higher by 0.7 percentage points, to 1.4%, weighing on the regional average increase.
In February (the latest available data for most member states) Belgium had the highest inflation rate, at 3.3%, followed by the Baltic states, where inflation was 3.2-3.3%, and Austria, at 2.4%. More modest inflation was recorded in the Netherlands, Portugal and Greece, at 1.6-1.7%, whereas inflation in Ireland was just 0.3%, reflecting the impact of euro appreciation on the cost of the country's imports from the UK, Ireland's main supplier.
Upturn in inflation driven by energy prices
Unwinding energy price base effects were largely responsible for the pick-up in inflation in the euro zone at the turn of 2016-17, and underlying price pressures have remained weak. Global oil prices fell rapidly in the second half of 2015, with the result that energy prices were 30% lower in year-on-year terms on average in the first seven months of 2016. However, this effect diminished around mid-year as global oil prices recovered, and the annual change in energy prices turned positive in October. Excluding the price of energy and unprocessed food, core inflation in the euro zone has been broadly stable in 2016 and the first two months of 2017. Further evidence of subdued underlying price pressure is found in a measure of average services inflation, which tends to be driven more by domestic factors: this was estimated at 1.3% in February, only marginally above its year-earlier level of 0.9%.
Supply-chain cost pressures will continue to build
The acceleration in annual inflation at the turn of the year largely reflected a low base of comparison after global oil prices plunged in late 2015-early 2016. As a result, the rise in annual inflation in the euro zone in the first quarter of 2017 is likely to fall back from the second quarter. Nevertheless, external price pressure will be building as global commodity prices continue their upward trend. We forecast that the price of non-oil commodities will rise by 8% this year, after a 3% decline in 2016, and oil prices will rebound by about 27% year on year, after falling by 16% last year. Alongside a recent spike in Chinese producer price inflation, this should boost average import prices in the euro zone, a net importer of oil and commodities.
Exchange-rate dynamics are also likely to contribute to upward pressure on imported price inflation in 2017. Having exhibited resilience to shocks for most of 2016 (including the UK's vote to leave the EU), the euro depreciated sharply against the US dollar following the election of Donald Trump as US president in early November, and stood at about US$1.04:EUR1 by the end of 2016, from US$1.11:EUR1 on average during the first ten months of the year. This resilience will be tested again in 2017 amid heightened political risk and a continuation of the ECB's programme of quantitative easing (QE) to end-2017. We expect this to maintain downward pressure on the euro this year.
Underlying price pressure is likely to remain weak
However, a subdued domestic demand environment in some of the euro zone's largest economies will continue to constrain the pick-up in inflation across the region. In France and Italy substantial labour market slack persists. The unemployment rate is falling in both countries but will remain at an elevated level this year, at about 9% and 12% respectively-more than double the rate in Germany, at about 4%. High unemployment will weigh on the recovery in domestic demand, feeding into strong price competition in the private sector as both French and Italian businesses remain reluctant to pass on the full rise in input costs to consumers. A decline in the unemployment rate in Spain, which has the fourth-highest weighting in the aggregate inflation measure, from 22% in 2015 to just under 20% in 2016, released pent-up demand last year, but core inflation has remained remarkably stable.
After 2017 the upturn in inflation will flatten
These dynamics will make it difficult for the ECB to keep the inflation rate at its target of "below, but close to, 2%" over the medium term. Reaching this target would require stronger-performing economies, such as Germany, to record a sustained period of above-target inflation in order to boost the euro zone average. However, although base effects from low oil prices have caused inflation in Germany to surpass 2% in early 2017, this influence will pass. Domestic demand is relatively firmer in Germany, and core inflation (excluding for energy and unprocessed food) was running higher than the headline inflation rate during most of 2016. But even in Germany there is little scope for a surge in domestically driven price pressure in 2017, as-despite low unemployment-wage growth remains modest: negotiated earnings growth in Germany averaged 2.3% in 2016.
With no inflation overshoot on the horizon, monetary policy will remain loose
For this reason monetary policy in the euro zone is likely to remain extremely accommodative throughout our five-year forecast period. From April 2017 the ECB will slow the pace at which it purchases assets under its QE programme, to EUR60bn (US$64bn) each month, from EUR80bn currently. However, Mario Draghi, the ECB governor, has been keen to emphasise that this was designed to ensure the bank's "sustained presence" in the market for a longer period than if purchases continued at the current monthly rate. After this, practical and political constraints of a further expansion of QE will mean that the ECB will begin "tapering" the monthly purchases at a rapid pace in 2018, signifying a winding down of the programme. In particular, there will be pressure from Germany to begin tightening monetary policy after inflation in the country hits 2%.
However, we do not expect an announcement on tapering to represent the beginning of monetary policy tightening in the region: interest rates are likely to stay low as inflation struggles to reach its target over the medium term. Even if inflation rises to its target level by the end of the forecast period, we expect the ECB to refrain from increasing policy rates until it anticipates a sustained target overshoot on the three-year policy horizon. We therefore do not expect euro zone interest rates to increase before the end of 2021.

a Qualitative grades are assigned according to the following scale: very good: score more than 8; good: 6.5 to 8; moderate: 5.5 to 6.4; poor: 5 to 5.4; very poor: less than 5.
The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings model seeks to measure the attractiveness of a country's business environment and its key components. The model's assessment of the business environment-based on the opportunities for and hindrances to the conduct of business-enables us to rank each of the 82 countries covered on its overall position and in each of ten categories on a global and a regional basis. The model uses quantitative data and expert assessments to measure the attractiveness of countries' business environments. The framework has been designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies in formulating their global business strategies and investment location decisions. The overall scores (on a 1-10 scale) and rankings are based on scores for 91 indicators, grouped into ten categories.
There is a moderate improvement in Europe's aggregate regional scores between the historical period (2012-16) and the forecast period (2017-21), reflecting the transition from the post-crisis period to one in which recovery and repair, although patchy, have in most countries been under way for some time. Western Europe's score remains broadly stable, rising from 7.5 in the historical period to 7.6 in the forecast period, and eastern Europe's score moves up from 6.1 to 6.5 over the same timeframe. Across the region as a whole, the strongest ranking improvements are recorded by Romania, Croatia, Cyprus, Spain and Denmark. By contrast, Turkey dropped by seven places, Poland by five and Germany by four.
EU countries remain well represented in the top 20 of our global rankings. Two non-EU countries, Switzerland and Norway, also occupy leading positions. The large number of west European countries in the top 20 reflects the high degree of political stability in the region (a post-crisis rise in social and political tension notwithstanding), large and competitive domestic markets, and a strong degree of openness to world trade. Although we continue to highlight the risks of political fragmentation and rising anti-establishment sentiment, we are not forecasting a marked anti-market backlash in policy choices.
Recent years have brought considerable improvement to the investment climate of central and eastern Europe. The early reformers among the countries of central Europe led the way in the early 1990s in adopting far-reaching stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation programmes. Reform in the Balkans has been much more uneven and subject to periodic reversals, but significant progress has been made even here. Factors such as a low-cost but well-qualified labour force, proximity to developed markets and, in some cases, ample natural-resource endowments have attracted considerable foreign direct investment to the region during the past decade. However, many east European countries still face fundamental reform challenges; meeting those challenges will test already fraying relations between governments and electorates, and heighten the risk of political instability and social unrest.
The outlook for the business environment in the countries of the former Soviet Union is mixed. In Russia, the business environment has suffered as a result of Western sanctions and a rise in tariff and non-tariff barriers. There is little evidence that the government intends to undertake disruptive structural reform to improve the dynamism of the economy. Low energy prices have prompted some regional commodity exporters, notably Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, to attempt to open up and diversify their economies. Ukraine has committed itself to an ambitious reform programme; however, its economic prospects will be harmed by disruption of trade and financial ties with Russia. In all the countries of the region the barriers to enacting wide-ranging reform remain formidable.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines ten separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, and infrastructure. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 16 (infrastructure), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2012-16) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2017-21). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2012-16. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2017-21 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
The main sources used in the business rankings model include CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce; Freedom House, Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties; Heritage Foundation, Index of Economic Freedom; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; UN, Human Development Report; US Social Security Administration, Social Security Programs Throughout the World; World Bank, World Development Report; World Development Indicators; Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Report.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2012-16 ranges are then used to derive 2017-21 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2017-21, not to the likely situation in 2021 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2014 or 2019). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text:   Country forecast overview: Highlights
The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast is that the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, will succeed in establishing a presidential system of government with few checks and balances on the powers of the presidency. We expect a majority of voters to approve the necessary constitutional reforms in a referendum on April 16th 2017, with the reforms coming into effect after the parliamentary and presidential elections to be held in late 2019. The risk of the reforms being rejected is high, owing to Turkey's deteriorating security and economic outlook. Regardless of the result, Mr Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) will continue to dominate the political scene during the forecast period (2017-21).
The failed coup in July 2016 will have lasting negative implications for the domestic political outlook, as well as destabilising effects on foreign relations and the economy. Emergency rule, which was introduced in July to purge the state of the followers of the US-based imam, Fethullah Gulen, who is accused by the government of masterminding the putsch, will continue to be used to silence government critics and disable the pro-Kurdish opposition. Emergency rule will remain in place until at least late July 2017, and probably beyond.
Turkey is vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and jihadi extremists affiliated with Islamic State (IS). Turkey risks be-coming mired in the Syrian conflict, following the deployment of Turkish troops to Syria to combat IS and to halt the territorial expansion by Syrian Kurds.
With the government preoccupied with domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges, we expect little progress on economic reforms to improve the business and investor climate. Fiscal policy will be loosened to try to boost the economy, but we expect it to remain relatively tight during the forecast period.
We expect the Central Bank of Turkey to tighten monetary policy further in the short to medium term in order to re-assert its independence from political pressure to lower interest rates, and at the same time to prevent a further depreciation of the lira amid expectations of higher US interest rates. An abrupt tightening could choke Turkey's already fragile economic growth.
We expect real GDP growth to accelerate slightly, from an estimated 2.2% in 2016 to 2.4% in 2017 and a still moderate 3.4% annual average in 2018-21. The current-account deficit has narrowed, but will still be difficult to fund, especially if global liquidity is tightened.

Our business environment score for Turkey remains broadly unchanged in the forecast period (2017-21), but the country's global ranking deteriorates by seven places. Uncertainty has developed regarding the future direction of economic policies. Turkey lags most central and east European countries for foreign direct investment. The main shortcomings are a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Privatisations are likely to be delayed amid the post-coup upheaval in the state institutions. Some companies, notably those with media holdings or ties with the Gulenist movement, remain subject to heavy-handed state intervention.
2019-21: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in a wide range of sectors, although the opening-up of the energy market makes progress.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2019-21: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in key sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Capital controls are not considered. There is a boost to trade following the lifting of Russian sanctions. Possible increase in protectionism under the new US administration.
2019-21: Customs union with the EU might be extended, but negotiations are likely to be protracted given the deterioration in Turkish-EU relations. More free-trade agreements might come into force with the EU's trading partners.
Taxes
2017-18: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make some progress. Tax rates are largely unchanged.
2019-21: A broader income tax base as exemptions and exceptions are reduced. Possible tax cuts and increased incentives.
Financing
2017-18: Cautious monetary policy and concern about a possible deterioration in credit quality constrain lending growth. The Central Bank of Turkey remains under political pressure to keep interest rates low.
2019-21: The banking system remains stable, despite some weaknesses. Heavy reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2017-18: Labour market remains rigid, with relatively high costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment. A 30% minimum-wage rise in 2016 could damage competitiveness. Obstacles to employing foreigners ease.
2019-21: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Progress, albeit slow, continues on investment plans in energy, transport and communications.
2019-21: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. The construction of major airport and urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Gaps and bottlenecks might, nevertheless, persist.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then, Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West, becoming a member of the Council of Europe (1949) and NATO (1952), and signing an association agreement with the then European Community (1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western/EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state governed under the 1982 constitution, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened under the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but the coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey has a unicameral parliamentary system of government with parliament elected for a four-year term. To win seats parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Under the AKP Turkey is moving towards a presidential system of government. The AKP's response to the failed coup is likely to strengthen the powers of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability is Turkey's biggest policy challenge. Fiscal policy has remained prudent, but large external financing needs and changing global liquidity conditions will require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy relatively tight to attract adequate capital inflows. The Kurdish problem, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is one of Turkey's most pressing political issues, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015 and there has been a resurgence in violence. The failed coup has highlighted long-standing institutional weaknesses, which allowed, with the AKP's consent until 2013, the secretive Gulenist movement to infiltrate the state. Further politicisation of the judiciary is likely after the coup attempt. Corruption and patronage remain widespread.
Taxation: The basic rate of corporation tax is 20%. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Tax reform to reduce evasion was one of the main elements of previous IMF reform programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2015 goods exports (fob) came to US$152bn and imports (fob) to US$200bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$48bn-a contraction from US$64bn in 2014. The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
Following the attempted coup by parts of the military on July 15th 2016 there has been a sharp deterioration in Turkey's political outlook, which The Economist Intelligence Unit expects to have lasting negative effects on Turkey's social and economic stability as well as on the country's international relations. We expect the severe clampdown by the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) on suspected coup plotters, political opponents and critics to continue under the state of emergency rule that was introduced in late July 2016 and will remain in place until at least late July 2017. More than 100,000 people, mainly in the judiciary, the military, the police, academic institutions and the media, have so far been suspended, dismissed or detained. Emergency rule was introduced to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of the US-based Islamic cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who is accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. However, the use of these powers has been extended to eliminate the pro-Kurdish political opposition, which the government accuses of having links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The attempted coup, the resurgence of political violence and the imposition of emergency rule have undermined Turkey's already fragile democratic institutions and governance structures.
The political scene will continue to be dominated by Mr Erdogan, whose plan to establish a presidential system of government with few checks and balances on the executive powers of the presidency faces its final hurdle in a divisive national referendum, to be held on April 16th 2017. Even though most opinion polls, including those commissioned by the AKP, suggest that the "no" camp has a narrow lead, we expect that a majority of voters will approve the reforms, which would come into effect after the parliamentary and presidential elections, scheduled to take place in late 2019. Mr Erdogan is popular and is a formidable campaigner; the "no" camp is divided, and the state of emergency has created a climate of fear that could deter people from voting against the reforms. A low turnout in such an atmosphere would probably favour the "yes" camp. However, the risk of the reforms being rejected cannot be overlooked and has in fact increased, as Turkey's security and economic outlook has deteriorated.
Regardless of the result, we believe it unlikely that there will be a rapid return to stability. In the event of a "yes" vote, there would be a two-year transition period before the reforms come into effect. In this period we expect that Mr Erdogan would continue to exercise his dominance through his control over the AKP and the cabinet. There appears to be no threat of a challenge or resistance to Mr Erdogan's leadership. An important question will be whether or when the government will decide to end the period of emergency rule. Emergency rule allows the president and the cabinet to pass laws without the approval of parliament and without recourse to the Constitutional Court, effectively allowing Mr Erdogan to govern as a president with executive powers. In practical terms, he is likely to use this transition period to create the new institutions and instruments of the new presidential system, staff them and, over time, complete the process of transferring policy determination and implementation from the present ministers and ministries to the presidential palace.
In the event of a "no" vote we expect that Mr Erdogan would continue to bypass the constitutional constraints on the presidency through his dominance of the AKP and the cabinet. He could also decide to call an early parliamentary election. The clampdown on the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) and the AKP's hardline nationalist stance on the Kurdish issue could cause the hard-right Nationalist Action Party (MHP) and/or the HDP to lose further support and fall below the 10% national vote threshold for party representation in parliament. This would boost the AKP's share of seats, possibly giving the party a two-thirds majority, which would eliminate the need for a referendum to change the constitution.
Security risk will remain high, with negative implications for the economy. The state is seeking to appease an insurgency by the PKK in the south-east of Turkey, address the domestic security risk posed by terrorist attacks by Kurdish militants and Islamic State (IS) in cities across the country, and implement military operations in Syria and Iraq against both IS and the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds. The purge of the Turkish armed forces and the police since the attempted coup has created operational capacity problems and contributed to intelligence failures that have exacerbated Turkey's domestic security issues. In the short to medium term neither the government nor the PKK appears to be interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will intensify.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
The next parliamentary and presidential elections are scheduled for early November 2019. We expect the current AKP government to last a full parliamentary term, although an early election cannot be discounted if the government's constitutional reform plan fails. We expect Mr Erdogan to stand again in the next presidential election and to remain in office, with enhanced powers, for at least one more five-year term. The next local elections are scheduled to take place by March 2019.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Since the failed coup Turkish foreign policy has been heavily conditioned by Mr Erdogan's domestic political goals, notably his push to establish a presidential system of government in Turkey. This approach, combined with ongoing political upheaval in Europe and the US, Turkey's traditional western allies, has resulted in a marked deterioration in Turkey's international relations.
Relations with the EU, and especially Greece, the Netherlands and Germany, have deteriorated sharply in recent months. This could eventually lead to the formal suspension of Turkey's EU accession negotiations and an end to Turkey's collaboration with the EU to stem the inflow of migrants and refugees into Europe. Neither Turkey nor the EU is genuinely interested in Turkish membership of the EU anymore, but we believe that Turkey is unlikely to suspend negotiations unilaterally. If Turkey reintroduces the death penalty, as Mr Erdogan has suggested since the failed coup, the EU might not be able to avoid suspending the process. Our baseline forecast has been that the death penalty is unlikely to be reinstated, but this cannot be ruled out given the government's increasingly hardline nationalist stance. An agreement on a solution to end the de facto division of Cyprus between the Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north could help to improve Turkey's relations with the EU, but we believe that a settlement is unlikely during the forecast period (2017-21).
The Turkish government's expectations of a reset of ties with the US under the administration of the new US president, Donald Trump, have so far proven unrealistic, causing growing frustration in the Turkish government. Although Mr Trump's administration is likely to be less concerned about Mr Erdogan's autocratic tendencies than its Democrat predecessor was, Mr Trump is unlikely to do much to address the two issues that are of most concern to Turkey: its request for Mr Gulen to be extradited from the US to face trial in Turkey for his alleged responsibility for the failed coup; and an end to US support for the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), which is fighting IS in Syria and is affiliated with the PKK.
Since mid-2016Turkey has improved its ties with Russia, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly in relation to the conflict in Syria, where both countries are militarily involved but are pursuing contrasting goals. We expect relations to remain largely transactional.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
We expect political instability and fluctuations in global liquidity as a result of anticipated shifts in US monetary policy to pose an ongoing risk to foreign capital inflows to Turkey, especially in the first half of the forecast period. These are predominantly portfolio investments and short-term loans needed to meet the country's large external financing requirements, so tend to be highly volatile. Faltering capital inflows since November 2016 have put the lira under intense pressure, fuelling inflation expectations and highlighting the need for the Central Bank of Turkey to tighten monetary policy after a prolonged period of loosening. An abrupt tightening of policy could strangle Turkey's already fragile economic growth.
The economy has shown considerable resilience during past bouts of volatility in global liquidity, owing largely to the country's solid public finances and well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector. However, Turkey's medium-term economic policy outlook remains a cause for concern. The AKP government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
Major upward revisions to Turkey's national accounts in December 2016 have helped to improve the country's budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios. Nevertheless, the public finances are in good shape and our baseline forecast remains that fiscal policy will be kept relatively tight to maintain a low level of public debt, and to try to avoid fuelling another surge in domestic demand and a further expansion of the still large current-account deficit. Reflecting the impact of the economy's weakness, we expect the central government deficit to widen moderately, from an estimated 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to an average of 2.1% of GDP per year in 2017-21. The government debt/GDP ratio is low, but we estimate that it edged up slightly to 29.3% in 2016, from 29.1% in 2015. We expect a further moderate increase in 2017-18, before it declines to about 30% in 2021. However, the risk of a larger deterioration in the public finances cannot be ruled out. The government's decision to transfer Turkey's major state assets to a sovereign wealth fund set up in 2016 to help to finance major infrastructure projects could bring to a halt the government's privatisation programme and increase political control over state companies, and the fund could become a vehicle for increased off-budget spending.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
We expect that in the coming months the Central Bank of Turkey will have to tighten monetary policy further in order to re-assert its independence from political pressure to lower interest rates to revive economic activity, and at the same time to prevent a further depreciation of the lira amid expectations of higher US interest rates. We expect the bank to use a mix of interest-rate rises, macroprudential measures and other policies. Having steadily lowered interest rates in May-September 2016, the central bank has raised most of its main policy rates since November 2016 and has increasingly provided funding to the banking sector at its previously little-used "late liquidity window" overnight lending rate, which was raised by a total of 200 basis points, to 11.75%, in mid-March. Since November 2016 the weighted average cost of the central bank's funds to the banking system has risen from 7.8% to 11.3% in mid-March 2017.
The central bank is seeking gradually to normalise its monetary policy frame-work to establish a single policy interest rate, the one-week repo lending rate, which would help to improve transparency regarding monetary policy decisions. However, it is unlikely that the corridor will be eliminated until inflation is more firmly on a downward path towards its medium-term target of 5% and domestic political uncertainty eases. From 2017 the bank will hold only eight regular Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meetings annually rather than 12.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Domestic political instability, perceived security risks from terrorist attacks and uncertainty about the global economic outlook will have negative effects on the economy in the short and medium terms. We expect real GDP growth to pick up only modestly, from an estimated 2.2% in 2016 to 2.4% in 2017. In 2018-21 we expect real GDP growth to average about 3.4% per year, assuming that there is a gradual stabilisation of domestic conditions. By far the biggest risk to our growth forecast is the possibility of a severe disruption to capital inflows to Turkey.
After contracting in 2016 by an estimated 0.4%, we expect private consumption to recover, but only modestly, in 2017, as domestic political uncertainty and a weaker lira will dampen household spending. An expected acceleration in 2018-21 will depend on the stabilisation of the lira and consumer confidence over the medium term.
After expanding by an estimated 15% in 2016, we expect government spending to increase by a further 12% in 2017 as the government seeks to revive the economy and boost support for the presidential reform referendum in April. From 2018 we expect more moderate-but still solid-growth (presidential and parliamentary elections are due in 2019).
The deterioration in the business environment since the attempted coup will continue to dampen fixed investment growth in 2017-18, as weakened business sentiment will offset government plans to invest heavily in infrastructure projects. In 2019-21 we forecast 4.9% average annual growth.
After contracting by an estimated 1.8% in 2016 as a result of the impact of Russian sanctions and domestic security concerns, especially on the tourism sector, we expect exports of goods and services gradually to return to growth, reflecting the lifting of sanctions and the impact of a weaker lira on export competitiveness. However, we expect the perception of security risks to persist for some time, which will continue to deter visitors to Turkey. Our expectation is that a sharp slowdown in the Chinese economy in 2018 and a cyclical downturn in the US in 2019 will dampen external demand growth in those years.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
Consumer price inflation has remained stubbornly high-well above the official 5% medium-term target-as a weaker lira has, for the most part, offset the disinflationary effects of plunging global oil prices since mid-2014. We expect further currency weakness and a partial recovery in oil and other commodity prices from 2017 to keep consumer price inflation well above the official target during the first half of the forecast period. Assuming that the central bank tightens monetary policy and does not loosen it too soon, we see inflation gradually easing, achieving the 5% target by end-2021.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
The Turkish lira exchange rate has been highly volatile and on a sharply depreciating path against all major currencies since September 2016. Amid further bouts of volatility we expect the lira to depreciate against the US dollar, to an annual average of TL3.84:US$1, in 2017-a fall of 21%. In 2018-21 we forecast that the exchange rate will remain broadly stable in real terms, depreciating in nominal terms to an average of TL4.08:US$1 in 2021. The lira will also depreciate sharply against the euro in 2017-21. There are substantial risks to our exchange-rate forecast, arising from uncertainty about the outlook for global financial flows, and the impact on investor confidence of domestic political instability and geopolitical turmoil in the region surrounding Turkey.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
GDP revisions, moderate domestic demand growth, sharply lower global oil prices and a weaker lira have helped to reduce Turkey's current-account deficit in recent years. However, we expect it to widen moderately and remain sufficiently large-at a forecast average of 4.8% of GDP per year in 2017-21-to make it difficult for Turkey to meet its external financing needs if global liquidity is constrained and the loss of investor confidence since the failed coup persists. Although a weaker lira will boost Turkey's main export sectors, we expect this to be largely offset by the higher cost of imported energy and inputs for manufactured import-intensive exports. In addition, the tourism sector is likely to take several years to recover to 2015 pre-crisis levels, that is before the resurgence of terrorist attacks and the imposition of Russian sanctions.

Full text:   Country forecast overview: Highlights
The battle between an opposition-dominated legislature and a government with control of key state institutions will heighten tension, introducing considerable uncertainty into The Economist Intelligence Unit's political and economic forecasts. Despite the unpopularity of the government led by the president, Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), and the persistent risk of economic collapse, we believe that the government will muddle through until the next elections are held in December 2018, after which we expect the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática coalition to take office.
A fundamental rebalancing of the economy is needed to avoid default and economic collapse, but there has been no sign of significant economic reform. Policy mismanagement will persist while Mr Maduro remains in office. Key problems include extremely expansionary macroeconomic policy, soaring inflation and a business climate that discourages investment. A new government will begin a gradual process of adjustment from 2019.
Sweeping reforms are required to restore confidence in contract and property rights, and thereby promote a recovery in investment. The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. From 2019 a new government will encourage private investment, re-establish market mechanisms for price stability and attempt to undo the constraints imposed by the PSUV on private firms.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and triple-digit inflation will hit private consumption, while the increasingly difficult operating environment will deepen the fall in fixed investment. After a deep recession in 2016, GDP will contract further in 2017 and will not return to growth until 2020. Our forecast for a weak recovery in 2020-21 rests on the assumption of an increase in oil prices and a new government that implements macroeconomic adjustment alongside institutional and structural reform. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, and our forecasts imply only a partial recovery.
At almost 300bn barrels, Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves, but its oil sector has suffered from disinvestment and mismanagement owing to political interference. The government claims that rising investment in the energy sector will lift oil production significantly in the medium term, but we foresee a continued fall in production in 2017, and only a very minor increase from 2018 as economic conditions stabilise.

Venezuela is in 80th position globally in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings for 2017-21, out of 82 countries covered. It is therefore one of the least attractive investment locations. This reflects state interventionism, highly heterodox macroeconomic policies, a lack of legal security and weak institutions. Regionally, Venezuela remains in last place of the 12 countries covered. However, we expect improvements after 2019.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Government persists with bias against free markets and ad hoc recourse to heterodox measures. Nationalisation poses a diminished threat, given fiscal weaknesses. Property rights remain weak. Price fixing undermines profitability.
2019-21: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Access to project financing is difficult and uncertainty over contractual rights persists.
2019-21: Efforts to attract foreign investment gather pace under an opposition-led government, but actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection remains weak.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2017-18: Frequent ad hoc adjustments to the unorthodox exchange-rate policy framework add to uncertainty. The state continues to exercise tight control over access to official-rate US dollars. Private firms must use a much weaker rate.
2019-21: Efforts to remove trade and exchange controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves gradually, after a political transition takes place.
Taxes
2017-18: Risk of tax increases diminishes, given the depressed state of public consumption. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2019-21: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2017-18: Credit growth remains firm, but sectoral allocation is distorted by administrative interventions. Banks remain highly profitable, although unpredictable enforcement and a weak regulatory framework heighten instability.
2019-21: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance is in short supply.
Labour market
2017-18: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. An ongoing freeze on redundancies, combined with a large informal sector and skill shortages, makes the labour market exceptionally rigid.
2019-21: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Access to water and electricity supplies remains precarious. Underinvestment in power transmission ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2019-21: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued electricity rationing.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed 1992 coup. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez was diagnosed with cancer in 2011 but, after declaring in July 2012 that he had fully recovered, won a fourth presidential term in October 2012. However, his health quickly deteriorated and he died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has since plummeted.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is a federal republic, successive administrations have proven reluctant to devolve political authority, with the transfer of financial resources from federal to local level highly dependent on the central government. The legislature is unicameral, and elections for the National Assembly take place every five years. In December 2015 the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática took control of the legislature, but has since met fierce opposition from other branches of government dominated by the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela.
Policy issues: Political radicalisation has been reflected in increasingly heterodox economic policymaking, with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus, and the nationalisation of industries deemed strategically important. Distortions created by this approach have become evident, with inflation rising sharply in spite of price controls, and with capital controls spawning a rampant black market for foreign exchange. Failure to invest part of the oil windfall has led to a startling decline in physical infrastructure. Non-oil production has in effect ground to a halt, leaving the economy entirely dependent on the energy sector. With large oil shipments going to China to repay loans, and (on subsidised terms) to regional neighbours via the PetroCaribe oil-financing scheme, the country is running very short of US dollars, forcing cuts in import spending.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 60% for oil firms. Since 2011 a maximum royalty of 95% has applied to oil extraction. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Official data are unavailable, but The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the merchandise trade surplus fell from US$27.2bn in 2014 to US$768m in 2015. The current-account balance is estimated to have turned negative in 2015, posting a 4.3% of GDP deficit. The deficit is estimated to have narrowed to 2% of GDP in 2016 owing to import compression.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
Amid the most severe economic crisis in the country's history, Venezuela's political scene will remain dominated by opposition efforts to unseat the president, Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), before the next elections, which are due to be held in December 2018. But The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect these efforts to succeed. Despite gaining a majority in Congress in late 2015, the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD) has been unable to force a negotiated political transition amid tight government control of key institutions, including the judiciary, which has effectively eliminated the National Assembly's powers. In addition, an increased role for the military in economic policymaking will bolster Mr Maduro's position, even if it comes at the expense of his own influence in government. Most recently, Mr Maduro has handed substantial policymaking powers to the new vice-president, Tareck El Aissami, a PSUV hardliner who is seen as being close to the army.
The main risk to our political forecast is of an early (and chaotic) transition, which would be triggered if default occurs and/or hyperinflation takes hold, and intensifying social unrest causes military support for the PSUV government to wane. Risks to the maintenance of the Maduro regime persist, as shown by looting and protests in the wake of the government's botched attempts in December 2016 to withdraw the highest denomination currency notes and replace them with new, higher denomination notes. Even so, the Venezuelan population has demonstrated an extraordinary tolerance for economic hardship, while wealthier citizens seek to source their needs through the black market. Barring outright economic collapse-which admittedly remains a substantial risk-social unrest is unlikely to be significant enough to weaken military support for the Mr Maduro government and force it from power.
On this basis, we expect the government to muddle through until the elections, in which the opposition MUD would be the clear favourite. Although we cannot discount the possibility that the government or military will intervene and prevent the holding of a free and fair presidential election in 2018, our forecasts are currently based on the assumption that they will go ahead, and that the MUD will win, taking power in 2019. An MUD-led government will implement economic adjustments to reduce the role of the state in the economy, and unravel the many macroeconomic and monetary distortions that the PSUV has implemented since it came to power in 1999. It will also begin the difficult task of reforming deeply politicised institutions. Given the scale of the economic distortion and institutional destruction that have taken place in Venezuela, there is a risk that this process will go less smoothly than we are currently forecasting.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
The electoral authorities are obligating political parties that secured less than 1% of the popular vote in at least 12 states in the December 2015 legislative election to re-register-in effect, all parties (59) aside from the ruling PSUV will have to do so. To remain in existence, opposition parties are required to secure the signatures of at least 0.5% of the electoral roll in at least 12 states, a criterion that is likely to force many small parties to fold. Some members and politicians will join other parties in the opposition MUD, which is a broad church of anti-PSUV parties. But the process will cause some tension and the MUD may well emerge as a weakened political force. After a controversial decision by the electoral authorities ruling out a recall referendum on Mr Maduro's presidency (eliminating the MUD's hopes to dislodge the incumbent from office early by constitutional means), opposition parties have been frustrated again by the postponement of regional elections, which were due to be held in December 2016. If the government does manage to serve out its term to the end of 2018, as we expect, the PSUV is unlikely to be re-elected, barring the use of non-democratic means (requiring the backing of the military) to remain in power. An MUD-led government would also retain control of the legislature, allowing it to pass its agenda, although weak institutional capacity and high political tension will persist.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Venezuela's relations with neighbours will remain strained while Mr Maduro is in office, and the election of Donald Trump as US president will probably result in greater tension with the US. PSUV governments have periodically stoked animosity towards the US in order to drum up nationalist support, but the Trump administration is more likely than any of its recent predecessors to react to this with economic measures such as a cut in oil imports, which would hit Venezuela very hard. Therefore, it is conceivable that Mr Maduro will tone down his anti-US rhetoric. Mr Maduro will seek closer ties with China, but further financial support is unlikely to be forthcoming in the short term. Reflecting its external financing difficulties, Venezuela will continue to scale back-and possibly end-oil shipments to beneficiaries of PetroCaribe, an agreement that provides cheap financing for oil exports to regional allies. Relations with Cuba, the closest of these allies, will become more distant as Venezuela's ability to provide economic assistance is eroded. In December 2016 Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) suspended Venezuela, which had been a member since 2012, highlighting a growing international consensus over the need to reprimand the Venezuelan government. Nevertheless, relations with Colombia have improved; Venezuela has recently permitted passage through some border crossings to allow its citizens to buy food and medicine in Colombia.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
It seems increasingly unlikely that the government will be able to manage the build-up of inflationary and currency depreciation pressures without some sort of policy adjustment between now and the next presidential election. In the absence of other alternatives, we assume that the Maduro government will be forced to weaken the currency more substantially in 2017 and 2018 than it did last year. However, other much-needed reforms are unlikely to be addressed by a government that has proved unwilling or unable to adjust policy sufficiently to move Venezuela's economy away from the brink of collapse. Fiscal and monetary policy will remain expansionary, and ad hoc policy interventionism and heavy state control of the economy will persist. Slightly higher oil prices will bring some relief, but import compression will remain necessary, as other sources of foreign exchange will be hard to find. At US$10.7bn in early March, international reserves remain far below historical levels, and are only about two-thirds of their end-2015 total. Even after a 2016 restructuring of debt owed by PDVSA, the state-owned oil firm, substantial external debt payments are falling due in 2017. We currently expect Venezuela to meet its 2017 obligations, which are mostly owed by PDVSA. However, given the extremely thin reserves cushion, the risk of default remains high, and would have dramatic economic and political consequences in the form of a sharp decrease in oil production, reduced import capacity, hyperinflation and probable political turmoil.
We expect the opposition to take power in 2019, ushering in much-needed market-driven adjustments designed to correct currency distortions, alleviate shortages of basic goods, tighten expansionary fiscal policy and rebuild institutional capacity after years of deterioration under PSUV rule. It is probable, given the scale of the challenge, that the new government will seek a financing agreement with the IMF to support the adjustment process. Efforts to secure increased inflows of foreign direct investment would also be likely under a new government, and would help to improve the balance-of-payments dynamics, although we expect direct investors to remain cautious for some time with regards to Venezuela, with the possible exception of the oil sector.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
The authorities' failure to publish data on the non-financial public sector since 2012 demonstrates the opacity of the public finances and complicates accurate forecasting of the size of the deficit. After ballooning to an estimated 24.3% of GDP in 2016, we expect the deficit to stand at a still-large 19.6% of GDP in 2017 and remain in double digits in 2018. The election of a new government should help to ease the deficit to 5.9% of GDP by 2021. The large deficits at present are mostly being financed by printing money; the money supply, as measured by M2, rose by 159% year on year in December, the highest rate on record. Meanwhile, high inflation and an overvalued currency erode the relative value of domestic and external debt, making debt/GDP ratios unreliable indicators of fiscal stability.
There is considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing, mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA. As these items are excluded from the public debt statistics, the true size of total public liabilities is understated. In October 2016 the government undertook a bond swap that will see around US$2.8bn of PDVSA debt due in 2017 (of US$10bn in PDVSA and sovereign debt in total) pushed out to 2020. This will alleviate some pressure next year, but does not resolve the country's external financing difficulties; we continue to see an extremely high risk of default. Despite this, the government has emphasised its commitment to pay, and we expect the next administration to follow through with its debt-servicing and repayment obligations.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
Monetary policy under the Banco Central de Venezuela (the central bank) will continue to be driven by the government's desire to keep real interest rates negative and to print money to finance large fiscal deficits. Amid extremely high inflation, we expect real rates to remain deeply negative in 2017-18. From 2019 our forecast of substantial currency and fiscal adjustment under a new government also implies a substantial tightening of monetary policy. We expect interest rates to rise sharply that year, declining only moderately thereafter.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Ongoing disruption to Venezuela's productive base and a collapse in consumer spending mean that, after a massive contraction in GDP in 2016 (estimated at 14%), we project a further contraction, of 5.5%, in 2017. We do not expect the PSUV to make the necessary adjustments to bring about a proper economic recovery and we thus forecast that recession will persist into 2019. Even after this, recovery will be relatively weak, given the depth and length of the downturn. Our forecast for a recovery in 2020-21 rests on our assumption of a rise in oil prices, alongside a political transition that produces a combination of macro-economic adjustment, and institutional and structural reform. However, reform will take time to bear fruit given the scale of the recession, and our forecasts therefore imply only a partial rebound; overall we expect real GDP to have declined by nearly 30% in 2014-19.
After dropping by an estimated 20.2% in 2016, private consumption will contract further in 2017-18, reflecting the impact of soaring inflation on real wages and disposable incomes, as well as government compression of imports. Imports account for a large share of consumer goods, owing to Venezuela's weak manufacturing base, which has been further eroded by currency distortions. Fixed investment will continue to contract sharply, reflecting the difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange, and remitting profits. Our forecast for a recovery in investment in 2019-21 is based on expectations of a political transition, progress on long­delayed joint projects with Chinese firms in the energy sector and-towards the end of the forecast period-a pick-up in public-sector investment. Exports will continue to shrink in 2017-18 as oil production falls further, but will pick up in 2019-21, reflecting increased investment under a new government, and a removal of constraints to domestic production. Import demand will rise faster than exports, in line with an alleviation of basic goods shortages and the release of pent-up demand from the recession years. Even after the change in government, however, dependence on oil will persist, and the next government will have to begin a process of economic diversification to produce a more robust domestic economy and promote non-oil exports.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
A decimation of domestic supply and severe shortages of foreign-exchange reserves have caused inflation to soar for much of the past two years. It will remain very high in the medium term but we expect a disinflation process later in the forecast period, assuming a change of government. No new official inflation data have been released since end-2015. However, according to unofficial data from Cenda, a local think-tank, the price of a basic basket of goods increased by 13.9% month on month in December, bringing 12-month inflation to an estimated 522%. Money supply (M2) growth accelerated to 174% in early February, up from 159% in December. Assuming that price pressures remain high in the first half of 2017 at least, we expect average inflation to be higher this year, at 562%, than in 2016. However, we continue to forecast a decline in inflation over time, reflecting moderately higher oil prices, which will bring in the necessary foreign exchange to help to alleviate scarcity of goods and the impact of persistent recession on demand. From 2019 fiscal and monetary policy adjustment will also be supportive of a gradual reduction in inflation towards double-digit levels (in year-on-year terms). However, before this happens, the lack of funds available for importing basic goods suggests that shortages will be rife, and the risk of hyperinflation (which we define as monthly inflation of more than 50%) will remain substantial.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
The authorities manage a dual exchange-rate system composed of an official peg, known as the Dipro, which is limited to priority public-sector imports and set at BsF10:US$1, and a heavily managed rate known as the Dicom. The Dicom rate weakened by 70% in nominal terms in 2016, but it accounts for less than 10% of all official transactions. In real terms, the average exchange rate (weighted by volume of transactions) continued to appreciate substantially in 2016, creating ever greater pressure for currency adjustment, the need for which is evident in the black-market rate, which was just over BsF4,000:US$1 in early March.
The pegged Dipro rate appears increasingly unsustainable-we assume that the government will devalue this rate shortly (to BsF25:US$1) and again in 2018 (to BsF500:US$1), as well as gradually increasing the share of Dicom in foreign-currency transactions, to 50% by 2018, up from a current level of about 8%. This effectively constitutes a maxi-devaluation, as distortions to the exchange rate would otherwise become unsustainable. Further major currency adjustment under a new government in 2019 will involve immediate exchange-rate unification. In the meantime, given existing distortions in the foreign-exchange market, there is an extremely high risk of a debilitating currency crisis in the short term. If confidence in the bolívar collapses amid hyperinflation, there is a possibility that dollarisation-or the launch of a new domestic currency-could occur.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
The current-account deficit will narrow further in 2017-18, reflecting severe import compression and a moderate recovery in oil prices, which will outweigh a continued gradual decline in oil output. The deficit will widen thereafter on the assumption that economic recovery draws in imports on a large scale after years of pent-up demand and in line with an easing of external financing constraints. Nevertheless, risks to the balance of payments will persist, although our assumption of economic adjustment in the medium term suggests some recovery in capital inflows, particularly into the oil sector. This should help to rebuild reserves coverage, although our forecasts assume that even by the end of the forecast period in 2021, reserves will cover only slightly more than three months of goods and services imports.

Full text:   Country forecast overview: Highlights
The new US administration led by Donald Trump has the potential to significantly shift Russia-US relations. However, any attempt to step back from US engagement with NATO will be strongly resisted by the US security establishment. Russian official and public discourse will remain anti-Western.
The likelihood that the US will ease sanctions on Russia has risen significantly since Mr Trump came to office; however, a great deal of uncertainty regarding the sanctions outlook remains.
Despite a reduction in fighting in Ukraine, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect the Minsk II deal to lead to a comprehensive political settlement. Ukraine will not regain full control of its border with Russia.
Russia will remain a mobilisation economy, characterised by high spending on the defence sector, a cautious approach to foreign investment in many sectors, protectionism and a large role for the state in the economy.
Formal political opposition to the regime will remain marginal. Vladimir Putin, the president, is likely to run again for president in March 2018 and win with a large majority in the first round. The principal concern for the authorities will be to maintain a high turnout in the absence of a meaningful contest.
The government is unlikely to implement disruptive market reforms. Minority stakes in some major state enterprises will be sold off. Chinese companies are likely to take a bigger role in the economy, including in the extractive sector.
Despite pressure to maintain defence and welfare spending, the government will cut public expenditure in 2017-19 to keep the budget deficit under control. The budget deficit will narrow to around 2% of GDP by 2019, from 3.5% of GDP in 2016.
The economy contracted by 0.2% in 2016. It will return to growth in 2017, but household demand will remain weak. International sanctions will weigh on investment and public spending will be tightened further.
The medium-term growth outlook will be constrained by structural weak-nesses, including a lack of competition, high state involvement in the economy, an ageing and declining workforce, and weak rule of law. We forecast average annual GDP growth of 1.4% per year in 2017-21.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 16 countries: Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine.
Russia falls two places in our regional ranking in the forecast period (2017-21), to 15th of 16 countries. This reflects manifold institutional weaknesses, poor rule of law, high levels of corruption and extensive state involvement in the economy. It falls to 70th out of 82 countries in our global ranking.
Country forecast overview: Russia's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Privatisation plans will proceed slowly, despite the announcement in 2016 of a new privatisation drive.
2019-21: Overall state involvement in the economy remains high. Government interference in private companies remains arbitrary. Rent-seeking officials remain a burden on business. Protection of intellectual property rights may weaken.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: International sanctions and low energy prices discourage major new investment in the oil and gas sectors.
2019-21: The "pivot to the east" will lead to further moderate growth in investment from Asia.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Some US sanctions may be relaxed. Membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is effectively suspended. The Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) internal market is undermined by exemptions and weak enforcement.
2019-21: The difficulty of trading across borders continues to be a weakness. The Russian ban on Western agricultural imports is likely to remain in force.
Taxes
2017-18: The resources tax on gas and the tax on tobacco rise. The freeze on the tax on vodka is extended. Direct taxes on in-dividuals and value-added tax (VAT) will not be raised, and the government may issue VAT concessions to selected sectors.
2019-21: A progressive consumption tax may be introduced. Tax inspections remain a burden on business. The time it takes to pay taxes approximates to international norms. There are some specific improvements in the corporate tax regime.
Financing
2017-18: International sanctions limit access to external capital markets, significantly raising the cost of financing.
2019-21: International financial integration proceeds slowly. The banking system remains weak and state-dominated. The government maintains its commitment to bail out systemically important institutions.
The labour market
2017-18: Spending on education is cut further. The incidence of strikes increases slightly, although the labour movement remains weak.
2019-21: Excepting skilled migration from Central Asia, labour mobility remains low. Highly skilled Russian managers command internationally competitive remuneration.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Budget constraints curb investment in infrastructure. Politically important projects are prioritised, but even here cuts are made. Russia struggles to obtain international funding for its infrastructure projects. Roads are starved of funding.
2019-21: It remains difficult to secure foreign finance. China provides only a limited alternative to Western funding.

Background: The transition to a market economy in the early 1990s was accompanied by a collapse in industrial production and a sharp drop in living standards. A contested privatisation process led to a highly concentrated ownership structure. Executive weakness and bureaucratic dysfunction contributed to a sharp decentralisation of power. After becoming president in 2000, Vladimir Putin sought to restore central control over the regions and tame independent corporate interests. Mr Putin presided over a period of strong economic growth in his first two terms. His re-election as president in 2012 has heralded the development of a more authoritarian domestic environment.
Political structure: Boris Yeltsin won the first democratic presidential election in June 1991 and was re-elected in July 1996. Repeated confrontations with the legislature culminated in the dissolution of parliament in September 1993 and a violent showdown the following month. The powers of the executive were greatly increased by a new constitution, adopted in 1993. Mr Putin was elected in March 2000 and re-elected for a second term in March 2004. Mr Putin's second term in office was characterised by increasing centralisation of the state. A loyal ally, Dmitry Medvedev, won the presidential election in March 2008 and took over in May of that year. Mr Putin returned to the presidency for a third term in May 2012. Following a constitutional change, his term will last six years, to 2018.
Policy issues: Mr Putin's third term as president has seen a greater emphasis on "conservative cultural values", anti-Westernism and great-power nationalism. The stand-off with the West is leading to a rollback of Russia's integration into the world economy. This is likely to strengthen further the state's role in the economy. Tit-for-tat sanctions have encouraged the government to focus on import substitution. The focus on curbing "foreign influence" on domestic politics is likely to endure, along with close controls on civil society, the internet and media.
Taxation: Reforms since 2000 have aimed to rationalise the tax system and cut the number of taxes and the corporate tax burden. Changes to the tax regime in January 2001 included the introduction of a flat rate of personal income tax of 13% and a simplification of the administration of social security contributions. In 2004 the basic rate of value-added tax (VAT) was reduced from 20% to 18% and a regional 5% sales tax was abolished. The corporate tax rate was cut from 24% to 20% at the beginning of 2009. The government has pledged not to raise personal or consumption taxes before 2018.
Foreign trade: Mainly because of high international oil prices, export revenue has soared since 2000. Import growth picked up over the same period as a result of rising real incomes and real rouble appreciation. Merchandise exports totalled just over US$340bn in 2015 and imports were just over US$190bn. Oil and gas account for about 70% of Russia's exports, with metals contributing a further 11%.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
Vladimir Putin's third presidential term, which began in 2012, has seen a shift towards "conservative cultural values", a more authoritarian political culture and more overt anti­Westernism. This has been further consolidated by Russia's confrontation with the West over Ukraine. Hardline figures, many with backgrounds in the security services, have increased their influence over policy areas outside the traditional security domain. Despite some pro-market rhetoric, economic policy has grown more statist and protectionist. The leadership will remain preoccupied by the need to insulate the economy and society from foreign, and in particular Western, influences and the perceived threat of externally sponsored regime change. These policy trends are likely to endure even with Donald Trump, the new US president, having stated his desire to improve relations with Russia.
The forecast period (2017-21) is likely to be characterised by slow growth in living standards, following a major decline in 2015-16, and further cuts in public expenditure in many areas. This contrasts sharply with the rapid growth achieved in Mr Putin's first decade in power and could have unpredictable effects on stability in the medium term. However, there currently seems to be little desire for disruptive reform among the broader population, and the potential for mass protest or major political change from below appears to be low. Social controls have been tightened since 2012, and the opposition has been marginalised and demoralised. Political engagement for much of the population appears to be limited to single-issue campaigns, and the cost of collective action remains high. The government tends to respond constructively when confronted with specific economic grievances. A mixture of state support and administrative pressure will keep major enterprises operating in provincial industrial towns. Concern over political stability is likely to hold the government back from pursuing radical reform.
The weakness of most political and legal institutions, as well as the person-alised, opaque governance system around Mr Putin, could present difficulties in managing an eventual presidential transition. Any successor is likely to come from the team around Mr Putin and will not herald a sharp change in the policy agenda. However, it may be difficult for any successor to build popular legitimacy, given the weak economic outlook. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect a political transition in the forecast period. Speculation about an eventual succession strategy is likely to intensify soon after the 2018 presidential election, however, and this will further depress business confidence and raise political uncertainty.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
The next presidential election will take place in March 2018. We expect Mr Putin to contest the election and win by a wide margin in the first round. Aleksei Navalny, an anti-corruption blogger and nationalist opposition politician, will be barred from participating in the presidential election, following a second conviction for defrauding Kirovles, a timber company. This suggests that the authorities intend to run a tightly controlled contest, offering voters no meaningful alternatives to Mr Putin. The main challenge for the authorities will be to prevent a sharp fall in turnout, which would throw doubt on the legitimacy of Mr Putin's popular mandate. This is one of the reasons behind the efforts to revitalise the regional leadership with the replacement of poorly performing governors.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
The Ukraine conflict has led to a sharp deterioration in Russia's relations with the West since 2014. In response to the conflict in Ukraine, the US and the EU have imposed sanctions on senior Russian officials and the Russian financial, energy and defence sectors. Russia has responded with a ban on almost all Western food imports.
The Minsk II ceasefire agreement, signed in February 2015, is highly unlikely to lead to a comprehensive political resolution of the conflict in Ukraine. The constitutional reform mandated by the agreement, which could formally embed Russia's proxies within Ukraine's political system, is politically toxic in Ukraine. In the highly unlikely event that it is passed, there is little chance that Russia will allow Ukraine to re-establish control of its side of the international border. Russia sees Ukrainian integration with the EU and NATO as a direct threat to its national interests, even though the second of these remains unlikely. Russia will not step back from its long-term objective of preventing a pro-Western government from consolidating in Ukraine. The current status quo, of a regularly breached ceasefire with contained levels of fighting, appears likely to endure for several years.
Mr Trump's presidency could have profound implications for bilateral relations and European security. Mr Trump has voiced scepticism about US alliances in Europe, expressed his admiration for Mr Putin and appears more amenable to forming an anti-terrorist coalition with Russia. However, it remains unclear to what extent Mr Trump's plans to reconfigure relations with Russia will be realised. As anticipated, Mr Trump's stated desire for rapprochement with Russia appears to be encountering strong resistance from the US security establishment. The links between senior figures close to Mr Trump and Russian officials have been the subject of intense media scrutiny, making it difficult for the administration to take measures perceived as offering concessions to Russia. In mid-February the leak of conversations between Michael Flynn, who had been appointed as national security adviser, and the Russian ambassador to the US led to Mr Flynn's resignation.
Regardless of Mr Trump's stance, Russia's broader foreign policy will remain nationalistic and anti-Western throughout the forecast period. Russia's policy towards its neighbours, and towards Ukraine in particular, will be an enduring source of tension with the West. Regime change in any country in Russia's immediate neighbourhood, particularly via popular uprising, would be likely to trigger a crisis in relations between Russia and the West. Without an institutional or strategic basis to Russian-US co-operation, the two presidents could quickly come into conflict when the next international crisis emerges.
The likelihood of a relaxation of US sectoral sanctions on Russia has risen since Mr Trump's election. The outlook is now finely balanced and complicated by the contradictory policy views held by various members of his team. However, given the high level of uncertainty, at this stage we do not assume a relaxation of sectoral sanctions in our macroeconomic forecast for Russia.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
With the economy set to return to growth in 2017, the constraints on macro-economic policy will ease somewhat. However, the fiscal position remains precarious. We expect the government to remain committed to a relatively tight fiscal and monetary policy to keep borrowing and inflation in check.
Economic reform will be subordinated to the imperatives of political stability and regime survival. We do not expect the government to move substantively towards liberalisation of the economy, and certainly not before the presidential election in March 2018.
A more likely scenario is that the government will seek incrementally to improve the efficiency of the system by replacing failing officials and bureau-crats, and cracking down selectively on corruption. Following the presidential election, the government is likely to extend the pension age and conduct a limited tax reform. Progress in strengthening the rule of law and protecting property rights is likely to be limited. The government will continue to sell minority stakes in some major state-controlled assets. However, as with the sale in December 2016 of a 19.5% stake in Rosneft, a Russian oil giant, the govern-ment's focus is on raising short-term budget revenue rather than increasing the level of competition in the economy or reducing state influence over it.
Russia's stand-off with the West has strengthened statist and protectionist trends within the government. Economic sovereignty-understood as insulating the economy from external shocks-will remain a strategic priority. The main elements of this strategy include a large positive sovereign external asset position (low public debt combined with substantial foreign-exchange reserves); protectionist measures to encourage import substitution and support domestic manufacturing; and a cautious approach to globalisation and foreign investment (which in "strategic sectors", such as the extractive sector, is likely to be permitted only in partnership with state-controlled companies).
Some policymakers have urged a further increase in state intervention in the economy, along with capital controls, expansionist monetary policy and a return to a fixed exchange rate. We believe that the government will continue to pursue a mixed approach, observing the broad tenets of a market economy, avoiding disruptive reforms and excessive market-distorting behaviour (such as capital controls), while maintaining a large state role in the economy.
We expect the government to remain committed to its import substitution policy, and formal and informal barriers to external trade will continue to be significant in some sectors.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
The government faces tight budget constraints as a result of international sanctions, low commodity prices and the reluctance of Western banks to handle international bond issuances (although Russia succeeded in placing two Eurobonds in 2016). The deficit in 2016 was the equivalent of 3.5% of GDP; however, this included extraordinary income from the sale of a stake in Rosneft in December last year. Without this, the deficit would have been 4.4% of GDP.
Under the government's budget for 2017, spending will fall from Rb16.4trn (US$276bn) in 2016 to Rb16.2trn. This is broadly in line with the Ministry of Finance's proposal in July that spending should be frozen for the next three years in nominal terms (which was based on the original expenditure target for 2016 of Rb16.1trn). Based on an average oil price of US$40/barrel in 2017, the government expects revenue to rise by 1.8%.
We forecast a higher oil price than set out in the budget, of US$56/b. This should boost revenue from the hydrocarbon sector. However, the finance ministry announced in early February that it intended to accumulate the extra tax revenue as foreign-exchange reserves, rather than transferring it directly to the budget. Overall, we forecast a deficit of around 3% of GDP. We expect the finance ministry to continue to trim the deficit in 2018-19, but the fiscal adjustment is likely to be less radical than planned, particularly given the forthcoming presidential election. We believe that the government is unlikely to hold expenditure fixed in nominal terms, as planned, in 2018-19. We forecast that the deficit will narrow to 1.2% of GDP by 2021.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) cut its policy rate by 50 basis points, to 10%, at its meeting in mid-September 2016. It kept the rate unchanged at its meetings in October and December 2016, and in February 2017. The most recent guidance from the CBR stated that the potential remains for a loosening of monetary policy in the second quarter, as disinflation has moved ahead of the bank's expectations. However, the CBR also noted that some of the factors holding down inflation may have a temporary character. It is now possible that the CBR will cut its policy rate by 50 basis points at its meeting on June 16th. We expect the policy rate to be cut by 1-1.5 percentage points this year (either two or three cuts of 50 basis points), to 8-8.5% by the end of 2017. The bias is now towards a faster rate of easing.
Real interest rates are likely to remain positive throughout the forecast period. The CBR governor, Elvira Nabiullina, has suggested that an appropriate level for the real interest rate would be about 2.5-3% when inflation moves close to the CBR's 4% target.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Russia's economic growth was decelerating even before 2014, as it ran into structural constraints, but the short-term growth outlook has been impaired significantly by weak oil prices and the fall in the rouble. The Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) now estimates that the economy contracted by 2.8% in 2015, and by 0.2% in 2016. Rosstat has not yet updated the quarterly GDP data for 2015-16 in line with its latest annual revisions. We have therefore suppressed all quarterly national accounts data and will reinstate these when Rosstat completes its revisions to the quarterly national accounts data.
Leading indicators point to growth in manufacturing and services output in the first quarter of 2017. We expect a modest rebound this year, led by a recovery in commodity prices and lower inflation, which should assist the gradual recovery in household consumption after two years of contraction. We expect a weak recovery in investment, after three years of contraction. Corporate deleveraging will slow and external financing conditions are likely to improve marginally. A relaxation of Western sanctions-not currently our core forecast-would provide a modest boost to investment. However, perceptions of political risk would remain high, limiting foreign direct investment (FDI) outside the commodities sector. Fiscal consolidation will continue to drag on public consumption and infrastructure spending. We expect only a modest pick-up in growth in 2018, as we forecast a significant slowdown in the Chinese economy in that year, which will weigh on some commodity prices.
In the medium term, outdated capital stock, a declining workforce, dependence on natural-resource sectors, institutional weaknesses, low investment and statist policies will limit real GDP growth. We forecast that growth will average around 1.5% per year in 2018-21, in line with CBR estimates of Russia's trend growth under the current institutional and macroeconomic framework. There currently seems to be little prospect of domestic institutional reform. High political risk and the poor business environment will continue to depress investment below the level needed to develop a higher trend growth rate, and the poor demographic outlook will remain a significant constraint.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
The CBR is aiming to reach its inflation target of 4% by the end of the year. It has a firm commitment to a relatively tight monetary policy as it aims to reach this inflation target. Inflation stood at 5.4% year on year in December 2016, but fell to 5% in January and to 4.6% in February. Disinflation has been assisted by a strong harvest last year and by the appreciation of the rouble. However, both factors could prove to be temporary and inflation expectations remain elevated. We forecast that consumer price inflation will average 4.4% in 2017, and that the CBR will miss its year-end target. The slowdown in China will lead to a depreciation of the rouble in 2018, but external inflationary pressures are likely to be low. We expect inflation to remain close to, but slightly above, target in the medium term, given low competition and trade barriers.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
Public confidence in the rouble has strengthened, but further falls in commodity prices could lead to renewed volatility. The rouble appreciated in January-February 2017 against the US dollar owing to higher average oil prices, and seasonal factors linked to the sale of foreign currency by commodity exporters. We expect the rouble to depreciate modestly from its current level over the course of 2017, leading to an average full-year rate of Rb60.5:US$1, against Rb67.1:US$1 in 2016. The slowdown in China in 2018 will hit Russia's terms of trade and we expect the rouble to depreciate by around 8-9% against the dollar on average in that year. The continuing underperformance and low productivity of the Russian economy will lead to further mild depreciation against the dollar on average in 2019-20.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
We have updated our external debt figures to incorporate new World Bank data for 2012-15. The World Bank debt figures are about 10% lower than local-source data, but show the same trend. We expect the current account to remain in surplus throughout 2017-21. The rise in oil prices forecast from 2017 will be partly offset by a recovery in imports as investment and household consumption pick up. International sanctions and political uncertainty will de-press FDI and portfolio inflows, although we expect these to recover in 2018-21.

Full text:   Country forecast overview: Highlights
The president, Mauricio Macri of the centre-right Propuesta Republicana (Pro), is pressing ahead with a programme of economic policy adjustment in an effort to eliminate distortions and return the economy to sustainable growth. The adjustment process is proving difficult, involving politically unpopular austerity measures, and the risk of social unrest will therefore remain significant for much of the forecast period.
Given the president's minority position in Congress, and the priority given to urgent macroeconomic reforms, there is likely to be limited progress on the pursuit of legislation that would successfully address long-standing institutional weaknesses and structural constraints to growth. Comprehensive reforms to strengthen bureaucracy, reduce corruption or enhance the effectiveness and independence of the judiciary will be slow. Furthermore, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect meaningful advances-at least in the short term-on a structural reform agenda (incorporating tax and labour market reform) that could improve long-term potential growth rates.
After a contraction in real GDP in 2016, reflecting macroeconomic policy tightening and currency depreciation, we are forecasting a pick-up in exports, investment and private consumption in the medium term. There will be a boost in business confidence from policy tightening. Combined with macroeconomic adjustment, and a gradual removal of foreign-exchange and import controls, these policies should set the economy on a more solid long-term footing. However, some aspects of the policymaking environment will remain suboptimal, with labour-market reform and a comprehensive fiscal reform remaining low on the agenda.
Currency adjustment should gradually bolster the current account as a weaker peso starts to boost goods and services exports and rein in imports. On this basis, we expect the current-account deficit to narrow in 2017-21 from the 2016 peak. We also expect the country's ability to finance moderate current-account deficits to improve over the forecast period, assuming that capital inflows pick up as investor confidence in the Macri administration grows.
Argentina's GDP per head is still among the highest in the region and, combined with improved access to credit, moderate rates of economic growth in the medium term will boost purchasing power and create market opportunities. Still-high poverty rates and income inequality will restrict the pool of consumers, but to a lesser extent than in many other countries in the region.

Argentina's global business environment score improves substantially in 2017-21, and the country jumps 20 places in our global ranking. A period of economic policy adjustment is under way as the centre-right government works to tighten macroeconomic policy, reduce state intervention in the private sector and encourage private investment. However, in many areas improve-ments will take time to materialise.
Country forecast overview: Argentina's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: The administration of Mauricio Macri works to address key weaknesses, including weak competition policy, the heavy burden of red tape and restrictive price controls.
2019-21: Continued work to build confidence in legal and regulatory framework. State participation in key sectors continues.
Policy toward foreign investment
2017-18: Efforts to resolve any remaining disputes with international creditors and investors as the government seeks fresh sources of US dollar inflows.
2019-21: Foreign direct investment is welcome. Improvement made in investment dispute settlement and availability of investment-protection schemes.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: Any remaining foreign-exchange controls likely to be removed. Continued efforts to improve the workings of the Mercado Común del Sur (Mercosur) and develop closer relations with the Alianza del Pacifico (the Pacific Alliance).
2019-21: Possibility that free-trade agreements make better progress.
Taxes
2017-18: Further gradual reductions of export taxes to encourage domestic supply. Tax system remains complex and burdensome.
2019-21: Comprehensive tax reform to improve federal-provincial revenue a possibility, but obstacles to reform persist.
Financing
2017-18: Banking penetration remains weak and long-term credit restricted, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, owing to weak long-term deposit base.
2019-21: Non-bank financing grows, but is constrained by a relatively small pool of institutional investors.
The labour market
2017-18: Tension with unions, owing to inflation. Political and bargaining power of the unions will remain strong.
2019-21: Progress on labour reform unlikely. Continued potential for conflicts with unions. Some skills shortages.
Infrastructure
2017-18: The Macri administration works to address weak contract rights and deficient regulatory regimes, which keep private investment below potential. Financing constraints hamper public investment in the short term.
2019-21: Some public and private investment set to improve energy supply and upgrade export infrastructure, but the risk of energy shortages will persist as demand grows.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates. b Actual.
Background: Economic liberalisation in the 1990s resulted in firm growth, but an inflexible exchange-rate mechanism and failure to deepen structural reform left the economy vulnerable to shocks, contributing to the collapse in 2001 of Fernando de la Rúa's centre-left government. An interim government took power until Néstor Kirchner of the Peronist party began a term in 2003. He presided over an economic rebound, which enabled his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, to win the presidency in 2007 and secure re-election in 2011. Economic policy mismanagement drove a change of government in 2015, with a centre-right candidate, Mauricio Macri, taking office in December 2015.
Political structure: Democracy was restored to Argentina in 1983 after 50 years of instability and military regimes. A strong presidential system is in theory checked by a bicameral Congress, comprising a 257-member Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and a 72-member Senate (the upper house); in practice, however, the presidency dominates. The presidential term is four years. There are 23 provinces and the Buenos Aires federal district, each with its own government.
Policy issues: Pro-cyclical expansionary policies contributed to GDP growth of an annual average 6.6% in 2005-11. But expansionary policy also produced significant imbalances in the economy in the form of double-digit inflation, real peso appreciation and a deterioration of the balance of payments. Amid currency pressures, the Fernández government resorted to foreign-exchange, import and capital controls, as well as ad hoc interventionism, to the detriment of the business environment. These policies did not reduce devaluation speculation, and left the economy extremely vulnerable to currency crisis. Macroeconomic adjustments to reduce economic distortions and set the economy on a more solid long-term footing are taking place under Mr Macri; these include peso devaluation, and fiscal and monetary tightening. Microeconomic reforms to boost domestic supply are also getting under way.
Taxation: The value-added tax (VAT) rate is 21%, although VAT on some goods and services is charged at a lower rate of 10.5%, and some services are taxed at a higher rate of 27%. Corporate income tax is levied at 35%, and personal income tax at progressive rates between 9% and 35%. There is a 0.6% tax on financial transactions (deposits and withdrawals). Taxes on exports were reintroduced in 2002, and have since been expanded to account for around 20% of total revenue.
Foreign trade: The current account shifted from surplus to deficit in 2010. Despite comprehensive controls, there was a current-account deficit of 2.7% of GDP in 2015.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
The president, Mauricio Macri, of the centre-right Propuesta Republicana (Pro) party, recently began the second year of his four-year term (ending in 2019) and is pressing on with a programme of economic policy adjustments to reduce economic distortions and return the economy to sustainable growth. Reflecting the scale of economic mismanagement under the previous government, the adjustment process has required politically unpopular austerity measures. These measures are taking a toll on Mr Macri's popularity, whose opinion poll ratings have fallen below 50%. The combined effect of a post-devaluation inflationary spike and cuts in energy and transport subsidies is hitting consumers hard, and patience with adjustment is wearing thin.
Voter weariness with austerity, combined with the approach of mid-term legislative elections in October, will complicate relations with Congress, where the president lacks a majority. The ruling Cambiemos alliance, which includes the Pro as well as the centre-left Unión Cívica Radical, has to negotiate support for its legislative agenda in both houses of Congress on an ad hoc basis with the various factions of the large Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party). So far this support has mainly been forthcoming, not least because the largest opposition force, the leftist-populist faction of the Peronist party, known as the Frente para la Victoria (FV), has been weakened by a series of damaging corruption scandals.
Going forwards, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects obstructionism to increase amid election-related politicking surrounding the October 2017 mid-term election, and as the October 2019 presidential election approaches. But mutual interest will ensure some continuing co-operation between Cambiemos and moderate Peronists. On top of this, a strong executive branch (the president has substantial powers to rule by decree) should provide Mr Macri with room for manoeuvre, even assuming that Congress becomes less co-operative. The president will also retain influence with powerful provincial governors, who largely control the Senate agenda but who are in turn deeply reliant on central government transfers, some of which are discretionary. As a result, we expect some continued progress on the govern-ment agenda.
However, we assume that with electoral considerations coming into play, there will be limited progress on legislation that would successfully address long-standing institutional weaknesses and structural constraints to growth. Compre-hensive efforts to strengthen bureaucracy, reduce corruption, or enhance the effectiveness and independence of the judiciary will be slow. We do not expect meaningful advances on a structural reform agenda.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
Mr Macri's Pro party is small but increasingly influential. Apart from the presidency, it now controls the governments of Buenos Aires city and province, which together account for almost half of the population. However, the Pro is in a minority position in both houses of Congress, and although it may make some gains in mid-term legislative elections in October 2017, it is likely to remain in a minority position throughout the forecast period, given the dominance of the Peronist party in national politics and its strong grassroots presence. The Peronist party is, however, split into various competing factions. As it loses the powers of patronage bestowed on it by the presidency and struggles with corruption allegations, the leftist-populist FV wing of the party will lose influence and the position of the traditional Peronist wing will improve, leaving it well placed to make gains at the expense of the FV in the 2017 mid-term elections.
The next presidential election is due in October 2019. Based on our assumption of moderate GDP growth and a return to single-digit inflation by then, we currently expect Mr Macri to win a second four-year term. There are substantial risks to this forecast, given the challenging external environment and the government's minority position in Congress. Reflecting the difficulties faced by minority governments in Argentina, no non-Peronist government has ever won a second consecutive term since the end of the military dictatorship in the 1980s. In this context, the emergence of a strong challenger from the moderate wing of the Peronist party is a strong possibility and the election will be closely fought.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Efforts by the Macri administration to repair relations with trade and investment partners have achieved rapid results, and we expect relations with key trade partners in the region and elsewhere to remain strong, with the possible exception of the US. Like most other governments in Latin America, the Macri administration was wrong-footed by the victory of Donald Trump in the US presidential election in November 2016. After cultivating increasingly strong ties with the previous US administration, led by Barack Obama, Mr Macri is likely to abandon recent efforts to secure preferential trade ties with the US with a view to an eventual free-trade agreement. The Argentinian government will remain keen to seek trade deals under the auspices of the Mercado Común del Sur (Mercosur, the Southern Cone customs union, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay; Venezuela was suspended from the group in 2016). The problem for Argentina and its Mercosur partners is that, just as the grouping has started to reverse its own protectionist tendencies, free trade has shifted off the political agenda not only in the US but also in Europe. Mr Macri recently visited Spain in an effort to drum up support for the deal, and negotiations are set to resume in March. But our forecasts do not currently assume a successful conclusion of free-trade talks with the EU, but the workings of intra-Mercosur trade are, at least, likely to improve in the forecast period. Efforts at joining the Alianza del Pacífico (Pacific Alliance, a regional trading bloc that includes Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico) may also make progress, although this is not currently reflected in our five-year economic forecasts.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
A reshuffle of the economic cabinet at the end of 2016 was more a matter of management style than of substance, and we do not expect any dramatic shift in the economic policy agenda under the new Treasury minister, Nicolás Dujovne. That said, Mr Dujovne is widely considered a fiscal hawk, and his appointment provides markets with a signal of Mr Macri's determination to tackle one of the government's next big policy challenges: the reduction of the fiscal deficit. The Macri administration has already made good initial progress on a programme of adjustment intended to put the economy on a sounder footing, having devalued the peso, reduced agricultural export duties and energy subsidies, and secured a deal with holdout creditors (allowing Argentina to exit default). Attention will now turn to the reduction of inflation, another key condition for a recovery in private consump-tion and investment. Combined with still-tight monetary policy, reduction of the fiscal deficit and nominal wage growth will also be required to reduce inflation, and achieving both will be politically difficult. Our baseline forecast assumes that there will be some progress in both areas, which should slow inflation and ultimately boost investor confidence. However, there are substantial risks to this assumption, as adjust-ment is taking place ahead of mid-term elections in 2017. Even under our baseline forecast, we do not expect inflation to fall to single-digit levels until 2019.
Moreover, under any scenario, certain aspects of the policymaking environment will remain suboptimal, with progress on labour market reform (to improve flexibility) or comprehensive fiscal and tax reform (to reduce costs and complexity) unlikely in the medium term. Other reforms to improve the business environment will be more successful. The government has already passed new public-private partnership framework legislation that should facilitate an increase in infrastructure investment; efforts to reduce red tape and support the development of small and medium-sized enterprises should also prosper, as will reforms to support the development of longer-term finance and the deepening of Argentina's currently shallow capital markets.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
Higher-than-expected revenue from a tax amnesty on undeclared foreign assets will bolster the fiscal accounts and bring the government closer to meeting its fiscal targets for both 2016 and 2017. We expect the fiscal deficit to come in at 4.5% of GDP in 2017, only slightly above the 4.2% of GDP target. We expect the government's gradualist approach to fiscal tightening to continue in subsequent years, bringing the fiscal deficit down to a more manageable level of under 3% of GDP by the end of the forecast period, and eliminating the primary deficit by 2021. To date, the govern-ment has taken some important steps to try to narrow the deficit, particularly by reducing costly subsidies and the public-sector payroll. Even so, in the light of recently announced income-tax breaks and increased transfers (to expand the social safety net), deficit reduction will be slow. There are also downside risks to our forecasts, which rest on two key assumptions: that expenditure as a share of GDP will fall by slightly over 1 percentage point (reflecting a smaller public-sector workforce, a further drop in subsidies and a reduction in the deficits of state companies); and that revenue will increase by around 1 percentage point in the same period (assuming that recent tax cuts are more than offset by a pick-up in revenue from trade and increased economic activity).
In the aftermath of the holdout deal, and assuming that there is progress on deficit reduction, the government's ability to finance moderate deficits without resorting to inflationary money printing will be much improved. A moderate public debt/GDP ratio (and low levels of external indebtedness), combined with the attractiveness of Argentina's still-high yields, should facilitate international bond issuance in 2017-21, following Argentina's exit from default earlier this year. In January the sovereign issued US$7bn in five- and ten-year global bonds. As a percentage of GDP, the public debt will stabilise at slightly over 50% in 2017-21.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
Notwithstanding a pause in the easing cycle in recent months, we continue to expect substantial rate cuts in 2017 and beyond. Between April and November 2016 the Banco Central de la República Argentina (BCRA, the Central Bank) lowered the monetary policy rate steadily, from 38% to 24.75%, where the policy rate stood in early March. We expect further, albeit smaller, rate cuts over the course of 2017, to slightly below 20% by year-end. The BCRA has made clear that it will prioritise monetary policy that is consistent with a reduction of inflation over the medium term, and our forecasts assume moderately positive real interest rates, consistent with a deepening of credit and the development of long-term lending. This forecast is supported by the BCRA's shift to an inflation-targeting regime from 2017 (with a target range for end-2017 of 12-17%, moving to 8-12% in 2018 and 5% in 2019), and assumes reduced political interference after a period of politicisation under the previous administration.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
After a contraction in real GDP of 2.1% in 2016, we expect real GDP to return to positive territory in 2017. But with Brazil likely to post barely positive growth in 2017, manufacturing activity in Argentina will recover only moderately, limiting GDP growth to 2.8% (revised up from our previous forecast of 2.5% owing to stronger data for the fourth quarter of 2016). We currently expect the recovery to peak at 3.5 in 2018. However, the annual growth rate for that year masks an expected sequential deceleration in the second half of 2018, resulting from a projected weakening of Chinese import demand. By 2019, when we also project a cyclical downturn in the US economy, real GDP growth in Argentina will slide back below 3%, before a modest recovery takes hold again in 2020-21.
Our forecast for a still relatively robust recovery in the medium term is based on the assumption that a combination of macroeconomic adjustment and improvements to the business environment will eventually have some beneficial impact on both export activity and domestic demand. An easing of inflation, combined with efforts by the Macri government to address the problem of legal and regulatory uncertainty and reduce red tape, should set the stage for renewed strong growth in fixed investment and private consumption, supporting an acceleration of GDP growth. On the supply side, growth should be bolstered in 2017 and into the medium term by a positive outlook for agriculture, and for investment in both infrastructure (which should see construction activity accelerate rapidly) and energy, including renewables.
There are downside risks to our GDP forecasts, as attempts by the government to reduce economic distortions and engineer a smooth adjustment to a lower-inflation environment could prove extremely challenging, keeping both con-sump-tion and investment subdued for longer than we expect. However, there is also some upside risk, as investment could overtake expectations from 2017 once the gains from macro-economic adjustment materialise and depending on the success of efforts to improve the framework for doing business. However, even in this scenario, in the absence of deeper structural reform efforts than we currently envisage, the potential growth rate will remain closer to 3% than 4%.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
The Macri administration introduced a new consumer price index in May 2016 to address widespread concerns about the quality of official data. However, because of a lack of historical data to provide a full picture of 12-month inflation trends, we are, for now, continuing to use the Buenos Aires city consumer price index as a proxy for inflation at the national level. This showed 12-month inflation of 38% in January 2017. Although high, this does represent a steep fall from a peak of 44.4% in May 2016, which resulted from currency and tariff adjust-ments by the new administration. Assuming tight monetary and fiscal policy (spending will remain negative in real terms until 2018), the inflationary spike will prove transitory, and we expect gradual disinflation in the medium term, provided domestic demand remains subdued relative to the boom years of 2004-11 and domestic supply strengthens on the back of an improved regulatory environ-ment for agricultural producers. The main risks to this forecast stem from possible failure to tighten fiscal policy as projected, a weaker than expected peso and the difficult process of reining in nominal wage growth. However, if the government is able to tackle the high level of wage indexation (a key obstacle to the reduction of inflation towards OECD levels), there is also the potential for inflation in the medium term to slow more than we currently project.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
Some modest depreciation pressure following Brexit in June and the US election in November caused the peso to weaken to Ps15.9:US$1 by end-2016, from around Ps14:US$1 at mid-year, but it has since recovered some ground to stand around Ps15.5:US$1. We expect renewed modest weakening in 2017-21, particularly in the first half of the forecast period as domestic interest rates continue to decline and the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) continues a monetary tightening cycle. However, the positive outlook for portfolio and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows will be supportive of the currency, which will dampen depreciation pressure and produce some periods of real currency appreciation (as has occurred in recent months). In nominal terms, we expect the peso to end 2017 at Ps17.78US$1 and 2021 at Ps23.61US$1.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
As the terms of trade improve and a weaker peso gradually boosts goods and services exports, improvements in the trade and services accounts will cause the current-account deficit to narrow. From 2.7% of GDP in 2016, we expect the deficit to fall to an annual average 1.4% of GDP in 2017-21. We also expect the country's ability to finance moderate current-account deficits to improve, assuming that portfolio and FDI inflows pick up as investor confidence in the Macri administration grows. The result will be a rise in foreign reserves in nominal terms. Our forecasts currently assume FDI inflows averaging 2% of GDP in 2017-21, with foreign reserves equivalent to an annual average 7.3 months of import cover in the same period.

Full text:   Country forecast overview: Highlights
The Economist Intelligence Unit assigns a high risk to the grand coalition government of the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) and the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) not serving its full parliamentary term to 2018, despite the coalition parties' recent renewal of their agreement.
Political risks have risen since mid-2015, as public unease about the influx of migrants and dissatisfaction with the mainstream ruling parties has boosted support for the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPÖ) and heightened intra-coalition tensions amid still weak economic growth. Since late 2015 opinion polls have shown support for the FPÖ at about 32%, above the two coalition parties.
Following several years of policy paralysis, in January 2017 the coalition parties announced a renewed coalition agreement. However, we expect im-plementation of the announced measures to be troublesome. If the government does face significant difficulties in delivery, we would expect the federal chancellor, Christian Kern (SPÖ), to push for early elections. He already seemed to be doing so during the recent negotiations, and he may want to cash in on his continued popularity before a failed reform attempt sullies this.
Little progress is expected in most areas of the government's reform agenda. This policy paralysis will hamper efforts to improve competitiveness, which over recent years has deteriorated relative to Austria's regional peers.
The government budget is forecast to remain in deficit, albeit at less than 1% of GDP, throughout the forecast period (2017-21) as the fiscal consolidation process suffers under limited government cohesion and effectiveness. However, we expect the public debt/GDP ratio to fall gradually over the forecast period.
Economic growth in recent years has been tepid, as productivity has weakened and export market shares have declined. Real GDP grew by 0.8% in 2015 but accelerated to 1.5% in 2016, driven by domestic consumption and investment demand. We expect a slight acceleration of growth in 2017, to 1.7%, reflecting mainly catch-up growth, and forecast average annual growth of 1.5% in 2018-21.
Structural factors, including higher unit wage costs and more regulated markets, will keep inflation higher than in regional peers; after 1% in 2016, we forecast 1.9% inflation in 2017, rising to 2% on average in 2018-21.

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 18 countries: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK.
Austria's business environment score improves slightly between the historical period (2012-16) and the forecast period (2017-21). As a result, the country rises to tenth place in the regional ranking and to 17th in the global ranking. Austria's strengths as a business location include decent infrastructure, stable institutions and co-operative labour relations, but high taxes, limited market opportunities and restrictive regulations will persist.
Country forecast overview: Austria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2017-18: Government works on reducing red tape, but progress is likely to be limited. Barriers to entry to network industries are likely to persist.
2019-21: Modest strengthening of the competition authority's powers. Administrative reform reduces red tape. More transparency in antitrust proceedings. Risk of political interference in private firms in which state owns substantial stakes.
Policy towards foreign investment
2017-18: Foreign investment is generally welcome, but underlying opposition to takeovers of "national champions" persists.
2019-21: Possible erosion of barriers against foreign takeovers as a result of commercial pressure and EU legislation.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2017-18: No exchange controls. Foreign trade, governed by EU rules, should remain liberal, except for agricultural goods.
2019-21: EU likely to accelerate shift towards bilateral free-trade agreements as multilateral trade negotiations stagnate.
Taxes
2017-18: No significant changes to the tax system, owing in part to government ineffectiveness.
2019-21: Some tax reform is likely if a government including the Freedom Party (FPÖ) takes power. Vested interests will continue to hamper large-scale reform and the high tax burden will remain.
Financing
2017-18: Financial stability to improve amid tighter regulatory requirements. Credit conditions ease gradually as banks' profitability recovers. Downside risks from financial, legislative and macroeconomic risks in central and eastern Europe.
2019-21: Introduction of systemic risk buffer of banks' risk-weighted assets. Further uptake in corporate bond issuance.
The labour market
2017-18: Economy-wide minimum wage is introduced. More stringent requirements for early retirement and invalidity pensions. Pay and hiring freezes in civil service. Unemployment trends higher as employment growth moderates.
2019-21: Continued expansion of labour supply, primarily via net immigration, but concerns about shortage of skilled employees in certain sectors are likely to persist. Early retirement phased out.
Infrastructure
2017-18: Further take-up of broadband services. Gradual improvement of transport links with eastern Europe.
2019-21: Improved transport network connecting main urban centres and providing better access to the country's interior. Gradual transition to low-carbon economy entails significant changes to electricity transmission infrastructure.

Background: Austria became an important force in central Europe with the formation of the Habsburg empire in the 15th century and remained so until the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the first world war. The Republic of Austria emerged in 1918. In 1938 Austria was incorporated into the German Third Reich. With the departure of the victorious Allied forces in 1955, it regained independence as a neutral country. In the post-war period Austria took great strides to catch up economically with the rest of the developed world and is now one of the most advanced nations. It is a member of the EU and a participant in the economic and monetary union (EMU).
Political structure: Austria is a federal republic and the head of state is the federal president. The government is led by the federal chancellor. The national parliament has two houses: the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house), of 62 members appointed by state parliaments, and the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house), which has 183 members elected by proportional representation. The last general election was held in 2013; the next is due in 2018.
Policy issues: The government's stated priorities are to reduce the budget deficit and debt pile, improve labour market participation rates, strengthen competitiveness, increase expenditure on research and development, continue to reform healthcare expenditure, stabilise the financial sector and raise educational standards. Progress on these issues will be modest at best as tensions surrounding immigration, security and border controls will remain elevated across Europe, diverting attention to security and migration-related policy areas.
Taxation: According to the European Commission, Austrian labour tax as a percentage of GDP is the second-highest in the EU. A 2016 tax reform lowered the tax burden for low- and middle-income earners, but raised the top personal income tax rate from 50% to 55%. Social security contributions, shared between employers and employees, are high. Corporation tax is levied at a rate of 25%. Dividend and investment income is subject to a withholding tax of 27.5%. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a standard rate of 20%, and a reduced rate of 13% (raised from 10% in 2016) applies for certain goods and services.
Foreign trade: In 2015 the value of exported goods was US$142.1bn and the goods import bill was US$140.4bn. The services surplus, traditionally boosted by tourism receipts, was US$11.2bn. Along with a significant primary income deficit and modest secondary income deficit, this yielded a current-account surplus equivalent to 1.9% of GDP.

Outlook for 2017-21: Political stability
The Economist Intelligence Unit assigns a high risk to the grand coalition government of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) calling an early election before the end of its term in October 2018. In May 2016 Werner Faymann (SPÖ), the then chancellor, resigned and was succeeded by Christian Kern (also SPÖ), then the head of the state railway firm.
A clear trend in recent state elections and in the presidential election in May-June has been gains for the opposition far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) at the expense of the SPÖ and the ÖVP. Opinion polls continue to show support for the FPÖ at about 32%, well ahead of the SPÖ (at 29%) and the ÖVP (at 19%). The FPÖ is the well-established party of protest, attracting support from voters who are dis-satisfied with the current government. It is therefore not surprising that support for the FPÖ has increased at a time when there is a widespread perception of stalemate within the current coalition, along with concerns about immigration, stagnant economic growth and rising unemployment. The fraying of the decades-long dominance of the political scene by the SPÖ and the ÖVP will weigh heavily on political stability in the years ahead. The FPÖ candidate eventually lost the presidential election, and by a larger margin the second time round, after it was rerun following irregularities in the vote counting process. However, that the FPÖ candidate, Norbert Hofer, twice managed to gain almost half of the vote, and on a high turnout, endorses our view that support for the FPÖ has become entrenched.
Recently, the outlook for the coalition surviving has improved slightly, after the two parties presented a new coalition agreement in late January 2017. In this they presented a number of measures, including a new minimum wage and enhanced security measures. However, relations between the two parties remain tense, and there are serious questions over whether it will be possible for the coalition to implement the announced reforms. In particular, it is uncertain whether Mr Kern and Reinhold Mitterlehner, the leader of the ÖVP, have a sufficient hold over their parties (and over the social partners and provincial governments, both of which are vital to implementation) to deliver the agreement in full and to the agreed timetable. If the government does face significant difficulties in delivery, we would expect Mr Kern to push for early elections. He already seemed to be doing so during the recent negotiations, and may want to cash in on his continued popularity before a failed reform attempt sullies this. We continue to believe that an early election is a likely scenario.
The FPÖ is likely to win either an early election or the next scheduled one and subsequently to attempt to form a government, although it remains unclear with which party it will choose to do so. The FPÖ's proximity to power means that it tends to moderate its views compared with far-right, populist parties in other European countries, such as France and the Netherlands. Mr Kern has been vocal in his disapproval of the FPÖ, but has been moving towards the party, including by pushing for curbs on intra-EU labour migration and by recently stating that his own party and the FPÖ were the only parties in Austria who wanted change. Regardless of which coalition emerges, we expect political stability to deteriorate further in the second half of our forecast period (2017-21). Relations with fellow EU member states will worsen in the event that the FPÖ enters government, putting pressure on the FPÖ's coalition partner, and we expect a government led by the party to be unstable, as it would struggle to implement its policies.
Outlook for 2017-21: Election watch
Alexander Van der Bellen was sworn in as president on January 26th, following the re-run of the second round of the presidential election, originally held in May 2016. The next election for the primarily ceremonial position of federal president is planned for 2023.
The next general election is scheduled for September or October 2018. Whether it takes place then or earlier, we forecast that the FPÖ will become either the largest or the second-largest party, and will then probably form a coalition with either the SPÖ or the ÖVP.
Outlook for 2017-21: International relations
Austria was severely affected by the European migrant crisis, and this has been the dominant issue in its international relations since 2015. The country has been at the centre of many of the intra-EU spats regarding the bloc's response to the large influx of migrants, owing in part to its unilateral actions. Domestic pressure on the government to be seen as acting against this influx, and thus often against other EU member states, will remain high owing to the rise of the FPÖ, and it seems to have driven the government to lower its annual cap on asylum applications. The government is repeatedly hinting that it wants to limit labour migration within the EU, or at least give preferential treatment to Austrian citizens on the labour market, which will exacerbate tensions with many EU member states.
The rerun of the presidential election in December 2016 demonstrated the relatively broad support for EU membership. Many voters cited as one of their main reasons for voting for Mr Van der Bellen suggestions by Mr Hofer of a possible membership referendum in Austria if the EU did not reform or if Turkey joined. This experience should moderate any further attempts by the FPÖ to use the EU as a divisive issue.
Outlook for 2017-21: Policy trends
Alongside the 2016 tax reform, which provided about EUR5bn in tax relief to households, government policy has focused on challenges facing the country's financial sector. These have included the clean-up and debt restructuring of Heta Asset Resolution (Heta), a "bad bank" that was created to deal with the toxic assets of Hypo Group Alpe Adria (HGAA). The uncertainty surrounding Heta was removed in October 2016 when creditors accepted a debt-restructuring deal. The government has also had to manage the banking sector's exposure to central and east European economies.
In its renegotiation of its coalition agreement in January 2017, the coalition decided on a number of measures that it hoped to implement before the end of its term, in 2018. These include a new annual minimum wage of EUR21,000, as opposed to only sector-specific negotiated minimum wages, and reducing red tape for employers, including more flexible rules on working hours. However, we are sceptical that tangible progress will be achieved in most of these areas, owing to a lack of cohesion within the grand coalition and within the parties themselves at the different levels of government. The same is true for a coherent policy response to relatively high unemployment despite continued (albeit weak) growth and the sustainability of the pension system, despite a widely shared belief in the need for reform. The next government, which is likely to include the FPÖ, will move integration and immigration policy further to the right, but we would expect it to struggle to implement significant structural reforms rapidly.
Outlook for 2017-21: Fiscal policy
In 2014 Austria's fiscal accounts deteriorated, mainly reflecting the govern-ment's decision to create a bad bank to deal with HGAA's toxic assets. The fiscal deficit widened to the equivalent of 2.7% of GDP, from 1.3% in 2013, and public debt rose to 84.4% of GDP. Mainly in response to steady direct revenue growth, the deficit narrowed to 1% of GDP in 2015, although the public debt/GDP ratio increased further, to 85.6%.
We estimate that the deficit was unchanged in 2016, despite fiscally expansionary tax reforms and higher migrant-related public spending, at the equivalent of 1% of GDP. We expect the budget to remain in deficit throughout the forecast period (2017-21), albeit below 1% of GDP, as fiscal con-solidation will continue to be limited and growth slow. The public debt stock as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline gradually, from an estimated 83.7% in 2016, following a positive contribution from the Heta deal, to just below 75% in 2021. In the context of the quantitative easing (QE) undertaken by the European Central Bank (ECB) and Austria's relatively strong fundamentals, funding risks are extremely low in our view.
Outlook for 2017-21: Monetary policy
Amid heightened political risk the euro zone economy is showing increasing growth momentum and we expect another healthy expansion in the region's economy this year, after growth of 1.8% on average in 2015-16. Nonetheless, the ECB is continuing to pursue an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero, a series of so-called targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) aimed at pushing banks to lend more money and an EUR80bn per month QE programme, which will fall to EUR60bn per month from April until the end of 2017.
The ECB's president, Mario Draghi, has emphasised that the reduction in the pace of QE was designed to sustain the bank's presence in the market for a longer period than if purchases continued at the current rate, and should not be viewed as "tapering", which would signify a winding down of the programme. We expect tapering to begin in 2018, but downside risks to global growth during that year, including our forecast for an economic slowdown in China and tighter monetary policy in the US, suggest that the pace at which the ECB unwinds its accommodative policy stance will be gradual. We maintain our forecast that the ECB will not tighten policy rates before the end of our forecast period, in 2021.
Outlook for 2017-21: Economic growth
Austria's initial recovery from the global financial crisis was respectable in the euro zone context, but subsequently the economy largely stalled. Underper-formance in comparison with Germany in recent years-in terms of headline growth, consumption, investment and unemployment-is particularly striking given the traditionally high level of synchronisation between the two countries' business cycles. Real GDP rose by a sluggish 0.8% in 2015, and although it accelerated in 2016, to 1.5%, this remained below growth of 1.8% in Germany.
The economy's relatively lacklustre performance in recent years reflects a number of factors. Austria's domestic reform process has faltered, and along with higher inflation compared with its regional peers this has weakened productivity and competitiveness, admittedly from fairly high levels, in relation to countries such as France, Germany and the Netherlands, hindering export performance. This has depressed labour market prospects. In recent years the labour market has not been able to integrate the increased labour supply, caused in part by the influx of migrants last year, and this has pushed up the unemployment rate, even though employment has been growing. This, in turn, has weighed on consumer sentiment, meaning that much of the windfall for consumers from low oil prices since late 2014 has been saved instead of consumed. Although inflation has picked up recently following increasing global energy prices and positive base effects, we expect a modestly improving labour market to drive consumption growth in the coming years.
We expect the current phase of catch-up growth, following an underperformance even compared with fundamentals in recent years, to continue and have made an upward adjustment to our real GDP growth forecast for 2017, to 1.7%. This still compares negatively with, for instance, the Netherlands, where catch-up growth in recent years has been around 2%. We expect the lack of reform progress to continue to weigh on growth throughout the forecast period and expect domestic demand to be the main driver of growth of just 1.5% on average in 2018-21.
Outlook for 2017-21: Inflation
Annual consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) has been subdued in recent years, but higher than in most other euro zone countries. Inflation averaged 0.8% in 2015 and 1% in 2016, well above average inflation in Germany and the euro zone in both years. This largely reflects structural domestic factors, such as higher unit wage costs, more regulated markets and a period of faster increases in taxes and duties. Rising services prices, energy price base effects and the lagged feedthrough of euro weakness via import costs fostered a gradual rise in inflation in the final months of 2016 and January 2017, and will continue to do so in the rest of 2017, when we forecast full-year average inflation of 1.9%. We expect inflation to stay above the euro zone average in 2018-21, at 2% on average, as similar structural factors as in previous years persist.
Outlook for 2017-21: Exchange rates
The euro has moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1 since mid-2015 and averaged US$1.11:EUR1 in 2016, with a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1, reflecting the sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following Donald Trump's election victory in the US. We now forecast an annual average rate of US$1.06:EUR1 in 2017 and US$1.07:EUR1 in 2018, reflecting heightened political risk in Europe and strong growth in the US, with the euro then appreciating gradually in 2019-21. We do not expect the euro to return to its long-term average value against the dollar even by the end of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2017-21: External sector
Low oil prices and subdued domestic demand compressing import values helped the trade balance to move into surplus in 2014-15, from a deficit in 2009-13. The recent recovery has pushed up imports and is estimated to have depressed the trade surplus in 2016. We expect further growth in the coming years and higher oil prices to push the goods trade balance back into deficit from 2018. However, this will be compensated for by a healthy surplus on the services balance, driven in large part by robust tourism inflows. Small deficits on the primary and secondary income accounts will not be enough to push the current-account balance into deficit, and we therefore expect continued, albeit slightly decreasing, current-account surpluses in our forecast period, of 1.8% of GDP on average.
