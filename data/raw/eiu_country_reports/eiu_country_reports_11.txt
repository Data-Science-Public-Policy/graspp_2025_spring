Full text: Italy--highlights: Political outlook
The March 2018 general election yielded a fragmented parliament, with the centre-right coalition taking 37% of the vote and falling short of a majority of seats under a new voting law. The election was also a resounding victory for the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S), which won 32.7% of the vote and the Eurosceptic, anti-immigration Lega, which took 17.4%. After a prolonged period of coalition talks the two agreed to form an anti-establishment govern-ment in late May, nearly triggering a constitutional crisis over the proposed appointment of a Eurosceptic finance minister, which the president vetoed. The government is led by Giuseppe Conte, a law professor close to M5S, and took office on June 1st. Mr Conte's deputy prime ministers are Luigi Di Maio, the leader of M5S, and Matteo Salvini, the leader of the Lega, who has thus far overshadowed Mr Di Maio with his brash, populist rhetoric. Giovanni Tria, a technocrat economist, serves as economy and finance minister. The admin-istration will seek to test the boundaries of compliance with EU fiscal rules and some of the bloc's other policies. It has proposed a series of unrealistic and expansionary tax policies, the rollback of recent pension and labour reforms, and a means-tested "citizenship income" for job-seekers. The govern-ment is likely to be unstable, and The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect it to last a full term in office.

Italy's business environment score improves slightly during the forecast period (2018-22), rising by two places in the global rankings, owing to a series of improvements linked to reforms passed since 2011. Under the M5S-Lega administration, however, many of these are at high risk of reversal. Italy's regional ranking improves marginally, from 16th to 15th. The macro-economic environment score remains unchanged, but owing to improve-ments in other countries, Italy slips six places in our global ranking and by three places in the regional ranking. The scores for policy towards foreign investment, financing and the labour market all improve. Italy's tax system remains one of the biggest hindrances to businesses and foreign invest-ment. Compliance is costly and tax evasion remains widespread.
Italy--highlights: Economic outlook
  2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022
Real GDP growth (%) 1.6 1.3 1.1 1.0 1.1 1.1

Exchange rate [euro]:US$ (av) 0.9 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.8
Economic recovery in Italy remains on track, but the real GDP growth rate is likely to slow modestly from 2018-19, remaining around 1% per year for the duration of the forecast period. The M5S-Lega administration will seek to loosen fiscal policy as much as possible, but is likely to keep the deficit within the 3% of GDP ceiling set by EU fiscal rules, as the market reaction to a larger deficit could be violent. Debt/GDP will remain around 130% for the duration of the forecast period, and we do not expect the M5S-Lega government to enact any meaningful structural reforms. Instead, it has proposed a raft of tax and spending policies that are prohibitively costly and will seek to undo recent pension and labour reforms.
Italy--highlights: Demographic outlook

Working-age population growth   -0.6 -0.5

The population increased at an annual average rate of 0.3% in 1999-2011. Since then the population has declined, falling to 59.4m in 2017, according to the UN's population estimates. We expect population to continue falling slightly during the forecast period, to 58.9m in 2022, reflecting the natural decline of the Italian population and lower immigrant inflows.

Household consumption per head (US$) 19,940 21,590 22,110 22,930 23,520 24,580
Italy is one of the largest and richest markets in Europe, with a population of about 6om. However, growth potential remains limited because the country is a mature consumer market with weak income and population growth pros-pects. Income levels differ greatly between the north and the south of Italy, with GDP per head in the south only about 46% of that in the north. Demographic trends will have an important impact on spending patterns, with population ageing driving healthcare expenditure.

Growth of real GDP per head 0.9 0.7 0.8
Growth of real GDP 0.7 0.5 0.6
Labour productivity growth 1.0 1.3 1.2
Our baseline forecast is that Italy's weak demographic profile will act as a substantial brake on real GDP growth, which we expect to average just 0.6% per year in 2018-50. A more favourable political environment could produce better economic growth performance in the long term, but the chance of improve-ments in Italy's institutional framework being implemented in the short to medium term is low.

Background: Post-war Italy has been characterised by a weak political structure and, since the 1970s, a declining economic base. Between 1996 and 2011 Italy had a bipolar political system, dominated by a centre-right alliance and a centre-left coalition. Since 2011 the political landscape has become more fragmented, with the break-up of the centre right, the emergence of the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) and a recent splintering of the centre left. Since the 2013 general election Italy has had three broad centre-left/centre-right governments. Matteo Renzi's resignation as prime minister after his flagship constitutional reform was rejected in a referendum in December 2016 led to the formation of a government led by Paolo Gentiloni, a close ally of Mr Renzi. Following the 2018 general election, an M5S-Lega government was formed.
Political structure: Parliament, which comprises two houses with equal powers, is elected for a five-year term. The president, who is elected by parliament for a seven-year term, decides, in the event of a political crisis, whether to call an election or to nominate a prime minister to try to form a government. The president also promulgates laws and may return a law to parliament for reconsideration, but has no power of veto. Executive power lies with the cabinet, which is nominated by the prime minister and approved by parliament. The prime minister cannot dismiss ministers without forming a new government. The legislative system remains unchanged following the rejection in the December 2016 referendum of a reform to reduce the powers of the Senate (the upper house). A new, predominantly proportional electoral system was adopted in October 2017.
Policy issues: The main issues are the management of, and attempts to reduce, Italy's large public debt (which stood at 131.7% of GDP in 2017), safeguarding the banking system and keeping Italy in the euro zone. In 2012 the government, led by Mario Monti, carried out a number of structural economic reforms to improve competitiveness. The process has since stalled, and the M5S-Lega government will seek to loosen fiscal policy, stimulate private consumption through tax cuts and income support to low earners, and seek to reverse or dilute recent pension and labour reforms.
Taxation: The top rate of personal income tax is 43%, and social security contributions are high, especially for employers. The corporation tax rate is 24%, reduced in 2017 from 27.5%, but additional regional and municipal taxes are levied, including the regional business tax (IRAP), to fund health services. The basic rate of IRAP is 3.5%, reduced from 3.9% in 2014. Income earned from most types of financial investment is taxed at 26%. The standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 22%.
Foreign trade: The value of exports of goods (fob) stood at US$496bn in 2017, and imports (fob) were worth US$433bn. In the same year the current account recorded a surplus of US$54.3bn, or 2.8% of GDP.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
The March 2018 general election yielded a badly fragmented parliament. The centre-right coalition fell short of the roughly 40% of votes needed to win a majority under the most recent electoral law, the so-called Rosatellum 2, coming in at 37%. Within the coalition, the populist, anti-immigration Lega (17.4%) surpassed Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (FI; 14%), which had previously been seen as the leading party on the right, and polled well ahead of the hard-right, post-fascist Fratelli d'Italia (4.4%). The election also saw a surge in support for the populist, anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S), which won 32.7% of vote, making it by far the country's largest party. After nearly three months of difficult coalition talks, M5S and the Lega agreed to form a coalition government under the leadership of a technocratic prime minister, Giuseppe Conte. Meanwhile the mainstream centre-left Partito Democratico (PD), under the leadership of Matteo Renzi, won just 18.9% of the vote, an all-time low, leading to Mr Renzi's resignation and the temporary leadership of Maurizio Martina. The PD and its smaller coalition partners won a combined vote share of just 22.3%, and Liberi e Uguale-a formation made up of primarily of left-wing splinter parties that spun off from the PD in opposition to Mr Renzi's leadership-took 3.4% of the vote.

Political outlook: Political stability
The general election on March 4th 2018 yielded a badly fragmented parliament. It also produced a resounding victory for M5S, which won 33% of the vote, and the Lega, which secured 17%. Following prolonged post-election negotiations-including a stand-off with the president, Sergio Mattarella, over the proposed appointment as economy and finance minister of Paolo Savona, a strongly Eurosceptic economist-on May 31st M5S and the Lega agreed to form a government. The administration is led by Mr Conte, a law professor and an independent who is close to M5S. The leaders of M5S and Lega, Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini respectively, serve as deputy prime ministers. Mr Di Maio has also been appointed minister of labour and social policies, and of economic development; Mr Salvini has taken the post of interior minister. Giovanni Tria, a moderate economist, has been appointed to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, but he and Mr Conte are likely to face political pressure from Mr Salvini and Mr Di Maio to enact more radical policies.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Conte government to be short lived. It is clear that Mr Salvini has no intention of dropping his campaign-style rhetoric and will continue to jockey for position with M5S. It is likely that Mr Salvini will attempt to engineer a political crisis, hoping that the president will grant an early election, at which the Lega is likely to gain ground. In the meantime the government will attempt to deliver on a part of its electoral promises and will send mixed signals regarding its intentions to comply with EU rules and common policies.
In addition to seeking looser fiscal policy constraints, the administration will press the EU hard on its immigration policies, demanding greater support for Italy in coping with vessels arriving across the Mediterranean and the processing of migrants in third countries. It will also advocate for more protective external trade policies, and possibly a loosening of EU sanctions on Russia over the annexation of Crimea.
We expect the M5S-Lega coalition to pass only a subset of the extensive and, in many cases, unaffordable policy changes that it has proposed. It has begun with less costly ones, such as stricter immigration policies and plans to dilute the 2015 Jobs Act (a labour market reform). In its 2019 budget proposal the government is also likely to seek to dilute the 2011 Fornero pension reform, in addition to disarming the budget safeguard clauses built into the country's fiscal framework that would raise value-added tax (VAT) rates and fuel excise taxes if alternative consolidation measures are not specified. A means-tested "citizenship income" for job-seekers is another priority and could be imple-mented in phases; however, it remains unclear how the government would introduce the costly two-rate "flat tax" on personal and corporate income promised by the Lega. We believe that the cost of such a measure would be prohibitive.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
Italy is governed by weak, divided executives, generally comprising multiparty coalitions, in which small parties often wield disproportionate power over policy decisions. Under the bicameral parliamentary system, all bills have to be passed in the same form by both houses of parliament in order to be enacted, often resulting in delays and the dilution of measures. This is unlikely to change following the rejection of the Renzi government's constitutional reform package in December 2016, which sought to reduce drastically the legislative powers of the Senate (the upper house of parliament) and would have effectively made the parliament quasi-unicameral. The new M5S-Lega administration bitterly opposed Mr Renzi's efforts to streamline the institutional framework, and further reforms are not a part of their law-making agenda.
Efficiency may improve in the public administration, but not in the judiciary
Red tape and Italy's inefficient judicial system are likely to continue to pose problems for businesses. However, modest measures introduced in recent years to increase public-sector accountability and efficiency should help to speed up gradually some bureaucratic procedures, although given entrenched resistance to change within the public administration, the implementation of the reforms approved in 2015 is likely to be slow. The M5S-Lega administration has also stated its intention to reduce red tape, but has not yet presented an ambitious, credible simplification programme. A partial reform of the judicial system was under-taken in 2014-16. However, many of the problems facing Italy's judicial system have not been addressed, including a fee system for lawyers that acts as a disin-centive to concluding cases swiftly, a lack of specialisation among judges and a highly fragmented court system. The average number of days to resolve a contractual dispute in Italy is more than double that in some other EU member states.
Corruption is still rife in business, judging by the number of corruption scandals revealed in recent years. A bill presented in March 2010 containing measures intended to combat corruption among public officials took almost three years to become law. Since then government action appears to have intensified. In June 2014 the powers of the anti-corruption authority were strengthened, and less than a year later parliament approved another anti-corruption law, including provisions eliminating the minimum threshold for the prosecution of accounting fraud and introducing harsher prison sentences for this offense, as well as corruption of public officials, embezzlement and mafia association.
Criminal organisations will continue to pose problems for businesses and deter investment, despite the authorities' efforts to combat extortion and usury and the arrests of several mafia bosses in recent years.
Political outlook: Election watch
The next parliamentary election is scheduled for early 2023, but we expect it to be held much sooner. Italian governments typically do not last a full term, and the Lega is currently polling at about 30%-equal to or just ahead of M5S in most surveys, and well above its vote share at the March election. We believe that Mr Salvini will run in coalition with the centre-right FI and Fratelli d'Italia. The earliest window for another election would be the first half of 2019, possibly coinciding with the next European Parliament elections (in May) if relations between M5S and the Lega prove to be particularly rocky. However, the administration could last another year or two if the Lega continues to extract policy concessions from M5S and public support for the government remains high.
Political outlook: International relations
We expect Italy to remain a member of the EU and the euro zone during the forecast period (2018-22). Other foreign policy mainstays, including a close relationship with the US, and membership of NATO and the UN will remain in place. During the election campaign Mr Di Maio confirmed that he would honour these relationships if his party formed part of the government. However, relations are likely to be strained, particularly with EU and euro zone institutions. Although the prime minister, the foreign minister and the economy and finance minister are all moderate independents, there is likely to be a degree of tension between these figures and Mr Salvini and Mr Di Maio. Mr Salvini and Mr Conte have already taken a more confrontational stance with other EU countries, refusing to allow charity ships carrying migrants in distress in the central Mediterranean to disembark on Italian shores, and taking a tough line on migration measures proposed at the June European Council.
In addition to pressing for a harder stance on asylum and immigration policy, the governing parties have said that they will oppose certain aspects of recent EU trade agreements, such as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). M5S and the Lega have also denounced EU economic sanctions against Russia, imposed in July 2014 following Russia's intervention in Ukraine, although the Italian government did not impede the extension of the sanction regime to June 2019. Our baseline view is that sanctions will remain in place, with Italy's support, for most of our forecast period.

Italy's business environment score improves slightly during the forecast period (2018-22), moving the country up two places to 36th in the global ranking and one place in the regional ranking, to 15th. The scores for policy towards private enterprise and competition, foreign investment, taxes, financing and the labour market all improve, reflecting the impact of economic reforms taken by successive governments since late 2011. Recent governments have also taken steps to reduce political opposition to foreign takeovers, and public receptive-ness to overseas investment has also improved. The parliamentary election held in March 2018 has produced a populist government that is likely to prove unstable and ineffective. There is a high risk that under the new government some of the improvements in legislation and macroeconomic performance will be reversed.
Italy scores poorly for government effectiveness. Following the rejection of Matteo Renzi's constitutional reforms, institutional reform is off the political agenda for the foreseeable future. A partial judicial reform was introduced in 2014-16, but is insufficient to resolve judicial system issues. A modest economic recovery remains on track. Promoting economic growth and employment, as well as reducing the public debt burden and repairing weaknesses in the banking sector, will remain the biggest policy challenges facing the government in 2018-22. Italy's tax system remains a major hindrance to businesses and foreign investment, and evasion is widespread. The new government's plan to carry out a radical overhaul of the tax system is unlikely to be implemented because of the expected cost, but uncertainty about the direction of tax policy has increased. Previous governments have taken some steps to encourage bank mergers and support banks' efforts to reduce the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) on their balance sheets, but progress has been slow.

Business environment outlook: Italy's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Political instability after the 2018 election will limit the possibility of significant reforms to improve competition.
2020-22: Further improvements in competition policy will depend on stabilisation of the political environment.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Modest reductions in red tape. Some streamlining of the judicial system, but lengthy delays persist.
2020-22: Organised crime, legal complexity and shortcomings in the judicial system remain deterrents.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Quotas and tariffs are in line with EU practice. Trade barriers remain low, but agricultural protection continues. The EU focuses on EU-UK trade deal in Brexit negotiations, further bilateral free-trade deals and responding to US restrictions.
2020-22: EU-US agreement will probably remain elusive. The risk of a euro area break-up, which could lead to capital controls, is low, but Greece's membership of the bloc remains in question over the long term.
Taxes
2018-19: Some labour taxes reduced in the 2018 budget, but achieving spending cuts to make further reductions will be difficult. Most political parties' promises of tax cuts after the election appear unaffordable.
2020-22: Overall tax rates stay high, but the burden of future fiscal tightening is likely to fall on public expenditure.
Financing
2018-19: Despite new legislation, bank mergers, further recapitalisation and non-performing loan (NPL) sales are slow.
2020-22: Banking sector exposure to the Italian sovereign will persist. Mergers of smaller co-operative banks and possible foreign takeovers accelerate, as will the sale of securitised bad loans. Profitability and credit provision are still weak.
The labour market
2018-19: Firms remain reluctant to increase open-ended contract payrolls. Universal unemployment benefit is gradually introduced. Some aspects of 2014-15 labour market reforms are reversed or diluted.
2020-22: Decentralised private-sector productivity-related pay deals may become more widespread; changes to public employment contracts face resistance.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Lack of political appetite for drastic current-expenditure cuts limits room for public investment. New government to review continuation of the construction of the Turin-Lyon high-speed rail link.
2020-22: Infrastructure still lags that of other euro area countries, despite some new investment.
Technological readiness
2018-19: M5S presses for further digitalisation of public services. A preponderance of smaller and family-run firms, and high levels of corporate debt keep research and development (R&D) spending low and uptake of new technologies in the private sector slow.
2020-22: Gradually improving economic and employment prospects, as well as Brexit, encourage more information and communication technology (ICT) graduates to seek work in Italy rather than abroad. Slight improvement in R&D and firm-level technology investment.

The Economist Intelligence Unit's assessment of the macroeconomic environment focuses not on headline real GDP growth (measured in the market opportunities category) but on economic stability and the underlying policy framework, which influence business planning, hiring and investment. Italy's macroeconomic environment score is unchanged in the forecast period. However, owing to improvements in other countries, Italy slips six places in our global ranking and by three places in the regional ranking. Despite some progress, economic reforms were introduced with a lag relative to most other struggling euro zone economies, and further measures to reverse more than a decade of stagnant productivity growth are unlikely in the current political environment. We expect Italy to keep its budget deficit within the EU's 3% of GDP limit and to continue generating primary surpluses (the budget balance excluding interest payments), but the public debt burden will remain about 130% of GDP during the forecast period.
The budget deficit will remain under control, but debt reduction will be slow
After a protracted period of stagnation, consumer prices have increased, largely owing to rising global energy costs. Demand-side inflationary pressures will remain subdued, owing to continued weak household consumption, labour market slack and high unemployment, as well as constrained wage growth.
Export growth and low global energy prices will keep Italy's current account in surplus during the forecast period. Nevertheless, concerns remain over the erosion of the country's export competitiveness, stagnant productivity and an escalating global trade conflict.

Policy towards private enterprise and competition remains an area in which Italy scores poorly compared with its EU peers, reflecting weak implementation and enforcement of competition rules. Generally, EU directives have been the main drivers of liberalisation in Italy, forcing successive governments (which, regardless of their political leaning, have not instinctively favoured compe-tition) to open up markets in several sectors, notably telecommuni-cations, energy and professional services. The powers of the Italian Competition Authority were strengthened and its remit extended to cover the provision of public services in 2010, but political pressure has generally limited effectiveness. This is also true of other watchdogs, including the Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa (Consob), the public authority responsible for regulating the Italian securities market, and the telecoms watchdog, Autorità per le Garanzie nelle Comunicazioni (AGCOM).
External constraints will continue to be the main drivers of liberalisation
In 2012 the then technocratic government led by Mario Monti, which came to power in late 2011 when Italy was threatened with losing financial market access at the height of the euro zone crisis, introduced a range of measures, including provisions to increase competition in retailing, taxi services, the sale of pharmaceuticals and utilities. The government also abolished minimum tariffs for several professions, including lawyers. In 2014-16 the Renzi govern-ment continued earlier progress in cutting red tape affecting businesses, stream-lining the complex tax system and, in particular, simplifying and reducing regulation of the Italian labour market. The introduction of reforms following the stress tests of the European Central Bank (ECB) in 2014 has reduced the influence of minority shareholder local charitable foundations in Italy's co-operative banks (banche popolari), paving the way for greater competition, consolidation and mergers. However, consolidation has been slow, owing to reticence to write down bad loans and new EU bail-in rules that require losses to be imposed on shareholders and junior bondholders, who are often retail investors, in return for government support.
Weak contract enforcement, few convictions for white-collar crime, and notoriously long court case backlogs will remain a prominent deterrent of foreign direct investment (FDI) and domestic business investment. Improve-ments introduced in 2014-17 include extended prison sentences for some white-collar crimes such as bribery, the establishment of support offices to reduce the backlog in Italy's Supreme Court, and an extension of the statute of limitations for serious crimes. However, political opposition and resistance from the judiciary remains strong, which will hamper implementation. With political instability likely to continue under the new M5S-Lega government, further major reforms are unlikely.
Further privatisations are likely to be delayed until after the general election
The privatisation plan that was re-launched in mid-2015 to highlight Italy's openness to foreign investment and reduce the level of public debt is likely to be abandoned under the new M5S-Lega government. This is largely because both parties have strenuously opposed the sale of state assets in the past. This means that the planned public offering of the state's remaining 30% stake in the national post office and financial services group, Poste Italiane, and the mooted sale of a 40% stake in Ferrovie dello Stato, Italy's state-owned railway utility group, are unlikely to happen. The new government's approach is most likely to favour the transfer to the CDP stakes in state-controlled firms such as the energy conglomerates, Eni and Enel, to boost revenue, and use of its powers of appoint-ment to expand its influence at the top of state-controlled companies by replacing senior executives and board members put in place by previous governments.
The new government's first legislative act, the Decreto Dignità (dignity decree) approved by the cabinet on July 2nd 2018, contains a mix of measures including provisions to reduce the use of temporary employment contracts and discourage delocalisation (the relocation by firms of jobs to low-wage countries). Compensation for unfair dismissals has also been raised. The decree also requires the repayment of state incentives and subsidies with interest if a firm lays off workers in Italy to transfer production abroad.

The positive impact of economic reforms will only be felt incrementally
FDI inflows into Italy have generally been low compared with other similarly sized countries, including those such as France that have traditionally been seen as no more open than Italy. The main deterrents to FDI in Italy relate to complex bureaucratic and legal procedures, barriers to entry in areas of the services sector, inadequate infrastructure, high levels of taxation and energy costs, and labour market rigidities. Under past governments labour market reforms, modest business tax cuts and streamlining of Italy's complex tax system have begun to address some of these issues, resulting in an improvement in Italy's score and rankings in this category. The new M5S-Lega government is more isolationist than its predecessors, and its programme contains no specific policies aimed at attracting FDI. Given the economy's long-standing structural deficiencies, and the likelihood that the impact of recent reforms will be felt only incrementally, inward FDI in Italy will continue to lag that in other large EU member states.
The collapse of the former state airline, Alitalia, in May 2017 highlights the difficulty of operating in Italy, even for major overseas investors such as Etihad, a UAE-based airline that bought a 49% stake in Alitalia in 2014. In April 2017 workers rejected a restructuring plan, causing much-needed financing from the airline's investors to fall through. The airline, which the government is keeping afloat with a bridge loan, is now in the hands of three special administrators who were given six months to sell the airline or liquidate it. Political uncertainty has reigned since the 2018 general election. This has put off investors with a declared interest, as well as delaying a final decision by the administrators and prompting the European Commission to launch an investigation into illegal state aid.
Judicial reforms introduced in 2014-17 should gradually improve contract enforcement, with signs that they are already reducing civil case backlogs. Legislation passed in 2015 should also encourage further financial sector consolidation, which could eventually attract FDI in the banking sector, although progress will be slow given political resistance. Bureaucratic complexity has dogged the sale of banks' securitised bad loans to foreign investors, but intense pressure from financial markets and new EU directives regarding provisioning will help to accelerate the process further. Although less ambitious than hoped for, anti-corruption legislation introduced since 2013 represents a further sign of intent to improve the operating environment for domestic and overseas investors.
Foreign takeovers, especially of luxury goods brands, are likely to continue
Corporate balance sheets and the ability to raise capital were severely damaged by the 2011-14 economic downturn. As a result, in recent years foreign companies have acquired or merged with a rising number of inter-nationally renowned Italian corporate brands, particularly in the luxury and consumer goods sectors, such as Bulgari, Valentino, Loro Piana and Luxottica. Despite signs of concerns among some law-makers regarding foreign takeovers, the trend is likely to continue during the forecast period. As illustrated by the Fiat takeover of Chrysler in 2014 and the bid by the Italian road toll company, Atlantia, for its Spanish partner, Abertis, large Italian firms are seeking opportunities to invest abroad.

Italy's EU membership determines the country's foreign trade and exchange policy. Full freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and persons exists within the EU (subject to transitional restrictions for newer member states), and we do not expect any exchange controls. Bilateral trade disputes between EU countries are resolved by the Commission or, in extremis, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the jurisprudence of which has played a major role in developing the single market. Compliance with judicial or other rulings within the EU is higher than in other regional trading blocs or the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Trade with Nordic neighbours Norway and Iceland is unrestricted under the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The EU has a customs union with Turkey and a range of bilateral agreements with Switzerland, all of which exclude agriculture.
In other sectors trade with non-EU countries is mostly subject to moderate customs duties. The EU takes a liberal approach to trade in industrial goods, with average unweighted most-favoured-nation tariffs, which cover most countries, at about 4%. Trade between member states and third countries has been largely gov-erned by multilateral agreements administered by the WTO. In 2015 the WTO reached an agreement on trade facilitation (reducing red tape at borders, and setting binding standards for customs and movement of goods internationally), but the Doha trade talks have stalled since 2008 and are unlikely to be revived.
The American protectionist trade policy under the current US president, Donald Trump, has resulted in a sharp deterioration in the global trade environment since the beginning of 2018. We expect a full-blown trade war to be avoided, but there is a risk that protectionist measures and countermeasures adopted by the US, the EU and China will cause global trade to shrink, which would have major knock-on effects for global economic growth.
Brexit to dominate the EU trade agenda beyond the 2019 departure date
The EU's trade agenda over the coming years is set to be dominated by negotiations with the UK, ahead of Britain's formal departure from the EU in 2019. Brexit negotiations have been acrimonious, which has decreased prospects for a satisfactory final agreement. As its third most important EU export market, Italy would be a major loser from failure to secure a satisfactory EU-UK free-trade agreement.
With multilateral trade liberalisation unlikely to make progress during the forecast period, the EU is looking to bilateral agreements to boost trade such as those reached with Canada, Mexico and Japan. However, these deals face resistance within the EU. Italy's new government has said that it will ask the Italian parliament not to ratify the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada because of insufficient protection of Italian foods. The EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is unlikely to reach conclusion following the election of Mr Trump as US president.

Italy's tax system remains highly complex, so compliance is costly
Italy's score for taxation improves slightly in the forecast period, but the country ranks fifth from last in our global ranking and bottom in our regional ranking in 2018-22. Notwithstanding some streamlining under previous governments, the tax system remains highly complex, making compliance costly and time consuming for private-sector companies. Also, despite some modest tax cuts since 2014, the tax burden has remained high and is unlikely to decline much, owing to a substantial public debt burden and EU sovereign debt reduction requirements. Tax policy remains highly uncertain under the new government.
According to Istat (the national statistics office), total tax revenue/GDP (including social security contributions) stood at 42.5% in 2017-slightly lower than in 2016 but higher than the regional aggregates of about 40% for the EU and the euro area. According to Eurostat data, Italy has the highest implicit tax rate on labour in the EU (aggregate tax revenue from labour as a percentage of the potential tax base). This was 42.6% in 2016, down from 43.6% in 2014, but 6.5 percentage points above the EU average and more than 4 points higher than the euro area aggregate. However, at 18.4% in 2016, down from 18.1% two years earlier, Italy's implicit tax rate on consumption was one of the lowest in the EU and about 2 percentage points lower than the regional average, highlighting this as an area to which fiscal tightening could be shifted from excessive labour levies.
Despite promises to reduce levies in 2016-18, labour taxes will remain high
Italy's rate of corporate tax for non-financial corporations is 24%, after a cut of 3.5 percentage points in 2017. Banks and most other financial sector firms, however, were excluded from the cut and continue to pay the 27.5% rate. In addition to a corporate tax rate, businesses also pay a regional business tax (IRAP), which is levied at a standard rate of 3.5%, and a slightly higher rate for most financial institutions. However, the central government can raise the regional business tax rate as high as 4.4% in regions running budget deficits. Regions and municipalities also apply personal income surtaxes at varying rates to offset the impact of cuts in transfers from the central government, which have been an almost constant feature of budget adjustments in recent years. Companies pay social security contributions at a high rate, by international comparison, of 30% (9.5% for employees). These are unlikely to be reduced significantly unless pension spending, which amounts to about 15% of GDP (one of the highest in Europe), is significantly reduced.
One of the policy priorities of the new government is to overhaul the tax system with the introduction of two-rate "flat" tax regime (15% and 20%), a no-tax area and a series of deductions to ensure progressivity. Independent estimates put the cost of the reform at EUR50bn, making its introduction unlikely without commensurate expenditure cuts, which would be politically unpopular and difficult to achieve. Currently the marginal personal income tax rate is 43% on gross annual incomes of more than EUR75,000.
Tax evasion and avoidance is widespread in Italy, encouraged in the past by frequent tax amnesties, a limited number and scope of inspections, and weak political will to close loopholes in tax laws. However, some progress was made during the crisis years, which may have improved compliance at least temporarily. It is unclear what the new government's stance towards tax evasion will be. Before reforming the tax system the M5S-Lega government has promised to introduce a "tax peace" scheme, which is essentially an amnesty. The Lega is also keen to abolish altogether the limit on cash payments.

Fragmentation remains one of the main weaknesses of the banking sector
Italy's score and global ranking improves substantially in the forecast period, reflecting the impact of a range of measures adopted by recent governments to encourage consolidation, support recapitalisation and try to tackle the issue of high NPLs. Nevertheless, the country still ranks below most other developed countries, which largely reflects delays in introducing reforms to address the Italian banking sector's weaknesses after the 2008-09 global crisis. The sector's major shortcomings are notably fragmentation, with few large banks and many small and medium-sized lenders; high operating costs because of excessive branch networks and personnel costs; low profitability; uncertainty about the quality of supervision; and heavy exposure to the sovereign, which leaves them vulnerable when concerns about government-debt sustainability increase. NPLs have declined considerably in recent years, but are still high at 11.1% of total credit as at end-2017. This is well down from 16.9% in the third quarter of 2015, but more than double the EU average of 5%.
Despite recent reforms, some consolidation and progress in reducing NPLs on banks' balance sheets, efforts to repair Italy's banking system have been beset with difficulties, largely relating to EU bail-in rules, which require losses to be imposed on shareholders and junior bondholders before government support can be granted. Although the state is ultimately likely to compensate small investors' losses, the bail-in rules have provided political capital for anti-establishment political parties and restricted government willingness to speed up bank resolutions.
Financing conditions for banks and the sovereign have been stable for several years, partially owing to the ECB's bond purchasing programme (quantitative easing, or QE), but the return of political risk in May 2018 over uncertainty about the future direction of the M5S-Lega government's economic policies, Italian government benchmark ten-year government bond yields have risen again, but to still relatively low levels. After several years of contraction or stagnation, bank credit to the private sector has expanded modestly since the beginning of 2016. The stabilisation in lending marks an important development for Italy's large number of small and medium-sized enterprises that rely largely on bank borrowing for financing.
Tighter monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve (the US central bank) and a tapering of the ECB's QE programme from the end of 2018 are likely to put upward pressure on government borrowing costs, which could also increase the cost of bank credit. Financial market volatility could also increase if political instability continues or rises under the new government.
Italy's four major banks (Intesa Sanpaolo, UniCredit, Banco Bpm and UBI Banca) are undergoing the 2018 stress tests that are being carried out by the European Banking Authority (EBA), the results of which will be made public in November. The baseline scenario is based on the ECB's December economic forecast with euro zone real GDP growth of 2.3% in 2018, 1.9% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020 (1.4%, 1.3% and 1.3% respectively for Italy). The adverse scenario envisages a hard Brexit-like shock to economic growth in the EU, leading to a deviation of EU GDP from its baseline level by 8.3% in 2020-the most severe scenario in terms of GDP deviation of all the EBA stress tests so far.
The results of the stress tests on four other banks, conducted under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) using the same EBA methodology, will not be published but will feed into the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). Banks with capital shortfalls under the baseline scenario will be required to plug the gap, whereas it will be decided on a case-by-case basis for shortfalls under the adverse scenario.

The labour market remains rigid, especially in an EU comparison
Recent reforms have contributed to improving the labour market score and Italy's global ranking in the forecast period, but this category remains an area in which Italy performs poorly compared with its EU peers. The Renzi government's Jobs Act legislative package passed in 2014-15 was a welcome development, but because the main reforms only applied to new private-sector hires, long-standing rigidities were only set to decline gradually. The new M5S-Lega government has promised to dismantle the Jobs Act, but its main focus has been increasing restrictions on the use of easily terminated fixed-term contracts. The Decreto Dignità approved on July 2nd 2018 allows them to be used for up to 24 months, compared with 36 months under the Jobs Act and 12 months prior to that. It also requires firms to provide a justification for the use of such contracts, which is likely to increase litigation, and pay an additional levy of 1.9% (up from 1.4%) when they extend a fixed-term contract. However, the cap of 20% of the workforce on temporary contracts for an individual firm remains unchanged. The decree also raises the minimum compensation for unfair dismissal from a minimum of four months' salary to six months and from a maximum of 24 months' salary to 36.
Other measures introduced under the Jobs Act that remain intact include reduced employment protection for long-term contracts and a much simplified contract system for labour market entrants by introduc-ing a standard open-ended employment contract with gradually increasing protection. The Jobs Act also increased the availability of unemployment benefits, streamlined the use of wage guarantee funds for temporary lay-offs or firm restructuring, and proposed to establish a new national agency to co-ordinate the activities of all employment services providers. The last of these reforms has not been implemented but was included in the M5S-Lega government programme.
The M5S-Lega government is seeking to dilute or reverse aspects of the Jobs Act
Reflecting the impact of a protracted recession, delayed reforms and weak economic recovery since late 2014, Italy's headline jobless rate remains high, at 10.7% in May 2018, compared with the euro area average of 8.4%. The youth unemployment rate was 31.9%-the third highest in the euro area and well above the 16.8% euro zone average. Despite some recent improvement, Italian labour market participation remains low, particularly among women and young people. According to Eurostat, Italy's employment rate was 62.3% in 2017, compared with the euro area average of 71%. The female employment rate was 52.5%, compared with 65.4% in the euro area.
In March 2018 Italy's three main trade union confederations and the business association, Confindustria, agreed a new national wage bargaining. It provides the basis for sectoral agreements at national level, as well as second-level plant or regional agreements linking wage increases to company performance and productivity gains. Greater use of second-level agreements would allow Italy to regain some of its lost export competitiveness, which has accompanied a decade of flat productivity growth and moderately rising wages. It could also address regional disparities in productivity and help to boost employment in southern regions where structural unemployment is higher.

Infrastructure quality in the south will continue to lag the rest of the country
As reflected in its unchanged score and the decline in its regional and global rankings, the quality of Italy's infrastructure is set to remain below the average of other developed countries during the forecast period. A significant disparity between the north and the south of the country will also continue. Budgetary constraints have limited public investment in the past 25-30 years, and local interest groups have succeeded in blocking or delaying several major projects in the transport and energy sectors. Corruption investigations are another relatively common reason for delays. Telecommunications costs have fallen and device ownership has risen, along with internet use and broadband penetration, but Italy continues to lag most other developed countries in these markets, and the rollout of high-speed broadband services has been slow.
Fiscal consolidation will hold back public investment in infrastructure
The economy minister in the M5S-Lega government, Giovanni Tria, has promised to revive public capital spending by curbing current spending, freeing up funds earmarked for infrastructure projects and removing administrative obstacles that have held up investments. However, Italy's high debt servicing costs combined with competing demands within the coalition suggest that a radical change in policy direction is unlikely. Since entering government M5S has continued to oppose the continued construction of the high-speed rail link through the Alps, from Turin in the north east of Italy to Lyon, a major city in south-eastern France.
Limited domestic energy sources and popular opposition to the development of nuclear-power generation will continue to cause uncertainty about security and diversification of supply. Poor infrastructure in energy distribution is likely to keep upward pressure on costs. Investment will also continue to face strong local resistance.
After a slow start, government efforts to accelerate investment in fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) networks providing high-speed internet access will make progress. Central to the government's plans is Open Fiber, which is now jointly owned by Enel and CDP. Open Fiber plans to build FTTH networks in 270 cities in Italy, investing EUR3.7bn in the development of the network, EUR3bn of this by 2020. In April 2018 the CDP also took a 4.2% stake in Telecom Italia, which plans to roll out its own fibre network. The CDP's move may eventually lead to some form of co-operation between Open Fibre and Telecom Italia that would avoid unnecessary duplication of the network.

This section, introduced as part of an upgrade to our rankings in 2018, aims to show how future-oriented the business environment is-the extent to which it is digitally connected, open to innovation and prepared for technological disruption. Italy's score deteriorates in the forecast period compared with the historical period, thereby contributing to falls in both our global and regional rankings. E-commerce is growing rapidly, reflecting improvements in the online environment, for instance regarding after-sales service; however, growth is from a low base with online purchases account-ing for only 6% of retail sales (compared with 19% in the UK).
Mobile-phone penetration is one of the highest in Europe, and take-up of new technologies such as smartphones and high-speed mobile contracts has usually been impressive. Spending on innovation, and research and development (R&D) is relatively low for a developed economy, largely reflecting a preponderance of smaller and family-run firms, high levels of corporate debt, and limited public financial support. According to OECD data for 2016, total R&D spending (for both the public and private sectors) was the equivalent of 1.3% of GDP (compared with an EU average of 1.9%).
Digitalisation of public services is a policy priority
The implementation of the Three-Year Plan for the Digital Transformation of the Public Administration in 2017-19 has facilitated steady progress. Digitalisation of public services is one of the M5S's policy priorities.
We expect a slight improvement in R&D and firm-level technology investment, partly supported by the tax credit for R&D investment in effect since mid-2015 and extended in the 2017 budget law up to 2020, but growth will be from a low base. According to the European Patent Office, the number of patent applications in Europe originating in Italy increased by 4.3% in 2017, compared with average growth in Europe of 3.9%. However, Italy only accounted for 2% of the total. Relative to the size of the population, patent applications from Italy was low, at just 70 per million population, ranking Italy just 19th-well behind other major European economies such as Germany, France and the UK.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
Since mid-May investors have grown more concerned about Italy's economic outlook. On May 29th-in the midst of the conflict between the president and the ruling parties over the proposed appointment of Paolo Savona as economy and finance minister-the spread of the generic ten-year government bond yield to its German equivalent spiked to 292 basis points-its highest level since 2013. However, the spread has since fallen and the yield remains moderate, at 2.8% in the secondary market at end-July 2018. Meanwhile Italian equities have fallen sharply, with FTSE MIB, Italy's main share index, losing about 9% since mid-May.
Markets have been rattled by the ambivalent stances of the government on EU fiscal rules, although Giovanni Tria has sought to reassure investors that the government will pursue orthodox policies. In an early iteration of their govern-ment contract the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) and the Eurosceptic, anti-immigration Lega made several incendiary proposals, such as a renegotiation of the EU treaties to allow countries to leave or opt out of the euro area. The content was greatly watered down in the final document, and much of it is likely to be abandoned.
Observers also remain worried that the government will reverse structural reforms-such as the Fornero pension reform and the Jobs Act, which the government has already taken steps to weaken-and directly challenging EU fiscal rules. M5S and the Lega also put forward a raft of unrealistic spending plans on items such as an expansionary pension reform, the Lega's two-rate flat tax and M5S's means-tested citizenship income. These were estimated to have a positive total net impact on the deficit of 6-7% of 2017 GDP.
Given the long average maturity on government debt, of just under seven years, perennial primary surpluses (excluding interest payments) on the fiscal account and the fact that about two-thirds of tradeable public debt is held domestically, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect a crisis in the near term that would lead to a loss of market access. However, owing to the EUR2.3trn public debt stock and the weakness of its banking sector, Italy would be too large to rescue without massive European Central Bank (ECB) support in the event of a large-scale crisis. A full-blown confrontation with the EU would pose a far greater threat to the euro area than the possibility of Greece's departure from the bloc.

Government debt 131.7 131.4 130.7 130.4 130.3 130.0
There is considerable uncertainty regarding the direction of Italy's fiscal policy. Mr Tria has asserted that the government intends to reduce the public debt and deficit. However, he has also stated that he does not intend to introduce additional corrective measures to meet the government's deficit target, of 1.6% of GDP in 2018, and has hinted that the 0.8% deficit target for 2019 agreed with the European Commission is too stringent. Signposts for changes in policy will be the autumn update to Italy's medium-term fiscal framework, due to come before parliament in late September, and the draft budget law for 2019, to be presented to the Commission in mid-October.
Our forecast for the 2018 deficit, of 2% of GDP, envisages considerable slippage from the official target. In 2019 we expect that the administration will further widen the shortfall by implementing a portion of its tax and spending pledges, including the neutralisation of the budget safeguard clauses, a partial repeal of the Fornero pension reform, greater investment in employment centres and the phase-in of M5S's citizenship income. Assuming that additional measures are taken on the revenue side, such as a tightening of tax expenditures, the deficit could be limited to 2.9% of GDP-just under the 3% ceiling mandated by the EU.
We believe that the government will not violate the 3% ceiling, as the degree of market volatility in May-June has shown that flagrantly breaching EU rules could trigger intense market pressure. This would be sharpened by the phase-out of the quantitative easing (QE) purchases of sovereign debt by the ECB at end-2018. From 2020 the deficit will narrow, from 2.8% of GDP to 2.5% of GDP in 2022, assuming that the government generates the higher primary surpluses needed to reduce the deficit as interest payments rise. We expect the debt/GDP ratio to remain about 130% for the duration of the forecast period (2018-22).

Long-term interest rate (av) 2.1 2.4 2.9 3.3 3.7 4.0
The ECB is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a QE programme that is running at EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018. The programme will run at EUR15bn per month in October-December before coming to an end. Economic activity in the euro zone has softened this year, but the ECB's view of the outlook remains fairly positive. Rising commodity prices and evidence of building domestic price pressure in some parts of the euro zone should mean that sufficient inflationary pressures will begin to emerge on the policy horizon in 2019-20. In response, we expect the ECB to take steps towards normalising its policy stance, with an increase of 25 basis points in the main refinancing rate to 0.25% in early 2020, followed by five more rises that will lift the main refinancing rate to 1.5% by end-2022. An increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019, easing the pressure on banks' lending margins and supporting profitability.

Despite domestic political volatility, we believe that domestic demand growth and a broadly positive outlook for the euro zone economy as a whole will continue to sustain Italy's moderate economic recovery. Following an expansion of 1.6% in 2017, we expect growth of 1.3% in 2018. In 2019-22 we forecast that real GDP growth will average 1.1% per year, with the pace of expansion dipping to 1% in 2020, reflecting a weakening of the external environment, driven by our expectation of a mild cyclical downturn in the US.
We expect the recent boost to real household disposable income and consumption, due to modest tax cuts, to diminish, slowing private consumption growth in 2018-20. Fragile consumer sentiment (reflecting political instability), concern about the impact on savings of protracted difficulties in the banking sector and only modest growth in employment and wages will also hold back private consumption growth. These developments are likely to be only marginally compensated by a rise in transfer spending as a result of the government's expansionary fiscal policies. We forecast annual average growth in private consumption of 1% in 2018-22, compared with 1.4% in 2017.
Public consumption returned to growth in 2016-17 after five consecutive years of contraction. Growth slowed to 0.1% in 2017, but we expect a looser fiscal policy to result in a pick-up in the pace of expansion in 2018-22. It will remain modest, however, at an annual average rate of 0.5%, held down by the need to keep the budget deficit smaller than 3% of GDP. The current administration's more lenient stance towards deficit spending will raise the risk of higher levels of government consumption, however.
Fixed investment expanded for the third consecutive year in 2017; however, owing to public investment cuts, weak business sentiment and difficulty accessing bank credit, it was still more than one-fifth below its 2007 pre-crisis level. We expect the expansion to continue in 2018-22, but forecast that the pace will moderate, from 3.9% in 2017 to an annual average of 2%, held back by public capital spending constraints, slowing domestic demand growth and risks to external demand. There is a risk that the slowdown will be more abrupt, owing to elevated political uncertainty and the potential for higher interest rates. The need to replace ageing machinery and equipment, the extension of tax incentives and a gradual easing of access to credit should prevent further contractions.
Following annual average growth of 6% in 2017, we expect the pace of export growth to moderate to 2.6% in 2018, and to average 3.3% per year in 2019-22, mainly reflecting a forecast slowdown in the US in 2020 and rising trade tensions between the US and the EU. Owing to moderate domestic demand growth and external demand constraints, we expect import growth to outpace export growth during the majority of our forecast period. These forecasts assume that the erection of tit-for-tat tariff barriers between the US and the EU will not precipitate a full-blown trade war. If a trade war were to ensue, trade with non-EU countries, which absorb about 44% of Italy's goods exports in value terms, could be disrupted.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Reflecting the severe impact on the industrial sector of the 2008-o9 global crisis and the subsequent ongoing euro area crisis, industry (excluding construction) accounted for 19.9% of employment in 2017, down from 21.8% in 2007, and 19.2% of nominal gross value added, compared with 20.5% of gross value added in 2007. The manufacturing sector has long been the main strength of the Italian economy, especially Italy's family-owned, small and medium-sized export-oriented companies specialising in products that require high-quality design and engineering. However, the sector faces major challenges owing to Italy's structural problems, the uncertainties arising from the euro zone crisis and domestic political risk, and uncertainty about the global economic outlook caused by the escalation of a trade war between the US and China and rising trade tensions between the EU and the US, as well as our expectation of a cyclical slowdown in the US in 2020.
Italian industry faces major challenges owing to structural deficiencies
In 2017 manufacturing accounted for 16.4% of gross value added, down from 17.8% in 2007 and 20.3% in 1997. The sector's decline has largely been driven by the prolonged weakness of domestic demand, but also by the difficulties that Italian exporters face in remaining competitive within the European single currency area. Unit labour costs have remained well above the euro area average since 2005 and have continued to rise in Italy since 2010, whereas they have fallen in other peripheral euro area economies such as Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Weak competitiveness and further transfers of low-value-added production out of Italy are likely to lead to a further decline in manufacturing's contribution to the economy during the forecast period.
The automotive industry is one of the flagship sectors of Italian industry. It accounts for about 8% of GDP, almost one-quarter of the contribution from all manufacturing industries and about 10% of the total value of Italian exports. Fiat (Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino), which was renamed Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) in 2014 after merging with a US-based producer, is the dominant producer in Italy, but the sector also comprises hundreds of firms that manufacture components or provide related services.
After declining in 2008-13, vehicle production in Italy picked up by 6% in 2014 and 45% in 2015, and slowed to 8.8% in 2016 and 3.5% last year. At 1.1m units, annual production is approaching 2007 levels. The fall in 2008-13 reflected the impact of the global economic crisis on demand in Italy and in export markets, as well as the transfer of production to lower-cost countries. A recovery in domestic and external demand drove the rise in output in 2014, whereas the double-digit increase in 2015 was largely driven by the addition of two new models to the FCA's production line at the Melfi factory in southern Italy. The drop in Italian production affected passenger-car output disproportionately. In 2013 passenger-car output was more than 70% lower than in 2000. Following a modest increase of 3% in 2014, Italian passenger-car production rose by 65% in 2015, before moderating to 7.5% in 2016 and 4.2% in 2017.
We expect growth in car registrations in Italy to slow to 1.4% in 2018 as political and economic uncertainty continues following the formation of the M5S-Lega government and rising inflation starts to eat into real wages. The decline in sales will also be driven by higher year-on-year comparisons. We forecast that growth will remain sluggish, averaging about 1.7% in 2019-22, and contracting slightly in 2020 as a result of a slowdown in economic activity linked to a cyclical cooling in the US. Commercial vehicle sales will expand more briskly in 2018, by 5.5%, following a modest contraction in 2017 after strong growth of 49% year on year in 2016. In 2019-22 commercial vehicle sales will also slow, to an average annual expansion of 1.6%, as small declines are expected in 2019 and 2020.
Fiat will face challenges in the wake of Sergio Marchionne's departure
Fiat's strategy to become a major global producer through mergers, acquisitions and alliances abroad is proving challenging and will probably not boost production in Italy, even if it is successful. The company has succeeded in raising margins globally, but has set ambitious targets through 2022, which will be all the more difficult to fulfil following the sudden departure and death of Sergio Marchionne, the firm's iconic chief executive officer since 2004, in late July 2018. Given Italy's high labour costs and other difficulties of doing business in the country, the recent trend of shifting automotive production out of Italy is likely to continue, despite FCA's repeated promise to increase domestic production. Fiat now produces about two-thirds of its vehicles abroad, in China, Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Serbia, Poland and elsewhere. It closed its Termini Imerese plant in Sicily at the end of 2011 and began producing cars at a new plant in Serbia in the first half of 2012. Integration with Chrysler could also result in more production being transferred to plants outside Italy. Following an agreement with the trade unions to introduce more flexible working practices and boost productivity and output at its plant at Pomigliano d'Arco, near Naples, the company transferred production of one of its models from Poland at the beginning of 2012. However, production at the plant was interrupted or reduced at various times during the economic crisis, when demand in the Italian and wider European car markets contracted.
Manufacturing sector performance will depend on the speed of the reforms
In the medium term the performance of the manufacturing sector will depend largely on the implementation of reforms to tackle Italy's structural deficiencies. These include issues such as lack of competition, particularly in the non­tradeable services sectors and utilities, which has meant that companies in Italy pay high prices for domestically produced inputs, such as electricity, compared with competitors elsewhere. The predominance of small companies and their lack of investment in areas such as innovation and research and development (R&D) has prevented them from moving up the value-added chain. There are about 388,000 manufacturing companies in Italy, about 97% of which employ fewer than 50 people. Firms with fewer than ten employees account for about 82% of the total.
Italian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are often aggregated within sector-specific industrial districts, which, through a combination of co-operation and competition, help to mitigate the impact of the difficulties arising from a lack of expansion. According to the Edison Foundation, a think-tank that monitors 99 industrial districts, exports from the industrial districts fell sharply in euro terms in 2009, but have risen strongly since the beginning of 2010, and previously marginal hi-tech districts have increased their weighting in the index as they have outperformed the overall index and Italy's traditional low-tech manufacturing sectors such as clothing and textiles, and home furniture.
Italian SMEs have begun to consolidate under the pressure of intense competition and the global crisis. However, the availability of domestic funds to support mergers or recapitalisations to start new projects is likely to be curtailed by the need to reduce the government debt burden. This has contributed to a rising number of internationally renowned Italian corporate brands being acquired by foreign companies in recent years, particularly in the luxury and consumer goods sectors. Global designer brands such as Bulgari, Valentino and Lora Piana have been sold to foreign groups, and as of mid­2014 Indesit, Italy's main manufacturer of white goods, is no longer majority Italian owned. This trend is likely to continue during the forecast period.
Construction sector activity is likely to remain subdued in 2016-20
Activity in the construction sector accounted for 4.7% of gross value added in 2017-down marginally from 2016, but well below an annual average of 6% of gross value added in 2006-09-and 6.2% of employment in 2016, compared with 8.6% in 2007. After nine full-year contractions, which left output in the sector about a third below its 2006 peak in real terms, the decline appeared to bottom out in the final quarter of 2014, but activity is likely to remain subdued during the forecast period, reflecting the impact of an eight-year decline in property prices up to 2016. On the EU's harmonised measure, house prices began to fall once again on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter of that year, and in January-March 2018, Italy was one of only three countries included in the index where house prices were still decreasing. This will weigh on the construction recovery, as will ongoing corruption investigations involving public works contracts and large government spending cuts are also likely to dampen activity. Various governments have sought to accelerate EU co-financed infrastructure invest-ment plans to provide some support to the sector, but little progress is likely to be made, largely owing to delays at the regional and ministerial levels.
The Lega will not embark on wide-ranking liberalisation programmes
Already accounting for almost 74% of gross value added, the services sector is expected to expand broadly in line with subdued average real GDP growth during the forecast period. Those subsectors that are exposed to foreign competition, such as tourism, are likely to struggle, although security concerns in several competitor markets could help. Sectors that serve mainly the domestic market and have so far enjoyed a high level of protection from competition, such as the professions and retailing, will come under pressure as a result of reforms to reduce barriers to entry, but this is likely to be only gradual. Over the near term, the M5S-Lega government is unlikely to embark on ambitious service-sector liberalisations and would be more likely to introduce protective legislation. High-value­added services sectors, such as design, which are closely tied to clothing, textiles and automotives, Italy's main export sectors, should continue to perform well, even though in some sectors production is increasingly being moved abroad to countries where labour costs are lower.

Following zero annual average consumer price inflation (EU harmonised, seasonally adjusted) in 2016, price growth averaged 1.3% in 2017, driven largely by higher global energy prices in the first half of the year, rather than by strong demand-led price pressures. We forecast that inflation will slow marginally, to 1.2% in 2018, and will remain around this rate in 2019-22. Italian inflation will be below the euro zone average during this period.

In 2017 the euro rallied as the region's economic recovery strengthened and expectations of QE tapering increased, and as political risk waned in Europe but rose in the US. The exchange rate peaked at almost US$1.25:EUR1 at the beginning of February 2018, but had weakened to US$1.16:EUR1 by late May in response to formation of a populist, Eurosceptic government in Italy, and remained close to that level in June-July. The value of the euro could yet come under further pressure from political risk in Italy, and also from monetary tightening in the US. Nevertheless, we expect a broad stabilisation on average, at US$1.21:EUR1 in 2018-21, as the euro is supported by an ongoing recovery in the region and receives structural support from a large current-account surplus, while the business cycle downturn in the US will weigh on the value of the dollar in 2020. Thereafter we expect the euro to appreciate to US$1.24:EUR1 on average in 2022.

We expect the current account to remain firmly in surplus, but to decline from 2.8% of GDP in 2017 to 2.2% of GDP in 2018 (revised down from 2.4%), and to average 1.9% in 2019-22. This decline reflects moderate domestic demand growth, a slightly weaker outlook for merchandise trade exports and rising international energy prices (Italy is a major energy importer). Having risen to an estimated average of US$54.4/barrel in 2017, we expect global oil prices to increase to US$73.6/b in 2018 and to an average of US$73.3/b in 2019-22.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Italy
Stocks and flows
Net inward foreign direct investment (FDI) flows are low compared with most other EU countries, and Italy has generally been a net exporter of FDI. Net inflows to Italy picked up to US$34.4bn in 2011 (1.5% of GDP), from about US$10bn (0.5% of GDP) in 2010, but declined again to close to zero in 2012, owing to large disinvestments. Net inflows recovered moderately in 2013-15, averaging US$17.5bn per year (0.9% of GDP). The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that inward FDI rose to US$20bn in 2017, the equivalent of 1% of GDP. Italy attracts less greenfield foreign investment than other large European economies. The total stock of FDI was US$552bn in 2017, compared with about US$865bn in France and about one-third of that in Germany and a quarter of that in the UK. In relation to GDP, the stock of FDI was 28.4% in 2017, compared with 22.9% in 2014, lower than in any other EU country apart from Greece. FDI outflows have also generally been quite small, mainly reflecting the prevalence of small and medium-sized companies in Italy. In 2005-09 Italy recorded substantial outward FDI flows as a result of several major investments abroad in the banking and energy sectors. A similarly large outflow, of about US$52bn, was recorded in 2011, the year that Italian car manufacturer Fiat (Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino) bought the US Treasury's remaining stake in Chrysler.
Origin and distribution
FDI from Europe accounts for about 60-65% of company revenue and employment generated by foreign companies with operations in Italy. Companies from North America represent about 25-30% of revenue and employment, and those from Japan for about 3-4%. The manufacturing sector contributed about 40% of the total revenue and value-added of foreign­owned firms, but this has generally been on a downward path and dropped sharply in 2005, when General Motors (US) sold its stake in Fiat. The utilities and telecommunications sectors have registered the most rapid expansion. In 2016, the last year for which data are available (expressed according to the directional principle), the largest FDI stocks came from Luxembourg (EUR64.5bn), France (EUR60bn), the UK (EUR43bn) and Germany (EUR28bn).
Determinants
The main attraction for foreign companies to set up operations in Italy is the size of the domestic market, which offers a population of about 6om and average GDP per head of US$40,3oo, at purchasing power parity (PPP). Deterrents include the complexity of Italy's legal system, inefficiencies in public administration, inadequate infrastructure-particularly in the south of the country-and often high regulatory barriers to entry, especially in services sectors. In addition, studies of the determinants of FDI in southern Italy have highlighted classical deterrents to investment, such as distance from major European markets, low presence of other foreign companies and a high level of organised crime. Such studies seem to indicate that fiscal incentives and the presence of specialised producer service providers have a low impact on foreign entrants' decisions, but that human capital is an important positive variable. Italy has an abundant workforce in the south, which has attracted a few high-technology investments to areas such as Catania in Sicily, where a Franco-Italian joint venture, ST Microelectronics, has a production plant and several research centres.
Impact
According to the ITA, the Italian Trade and Investment Agency, foreign-controlled companies employ more than 1m people in Italy and generate revenue of about EUR5oobn per year. Foreign companies invest on average three and half times more in research and development (R&D) than Italian companies. However, because of the comparatively low level of inflows and their concentration in the north of Italy, the impact of FDI on the Italian economy as a whole has been limited. The depressed areas of the south, which attract limited Italian private-sector investment, would benefit substantially in terms of employment and through the spillover effect of advanced technology, management practices and production processes. However, almost all of the inward FDI stock is located in the north and centre of the country. Despite massive state investment in 1950-84, the south has continued to lag central Italy and the north in GDP per head terms (less than 55% of the average in the centre and north). The unemployment rate in the south is almost double the national average and about three times higher than that in the north.
Potential
The possibility of higher FDI inflows in the forecast period will be hampered by the uncertainty caused by the euro zone crisis and the fact that most of the factors that have deterred FDI in the past will remain in place. The Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S)-Lega administration has also signalled a less friendly policy stance towards foreign investment, marginally tightening labour contract regulations through its so-called "Dignity Decree", definitively approved in August 2018, and providing for penalties for foreign firms that take advantage of government investment incentives and then divest or relocate production to other markets. Over the forecast period (2018-22) a slight improvement is expected in the efficiency of the public administration, as a result of recent and ongoing reforms. The performance of the state body responsible for attracting foreign investors may also improve. Given Italy's need to reduce its dependence on imported energy, there could be potential for investment in the still state-dominated energy sector as liberalisation continues to make progress and the authorities are forced to focus on investment in renewable energy sources, following the decision in mid-2011 to abandon plans to return to nuclear-power generation. Under the M5S-Lega government, which has taken an economic nationalist approach to policymaking, political opposition to foreign interest in ownership of utility networks and possibly some companies in the manufacturing sector is likely to continue, as such companies are deemed to be of a "strategic" nature. M5S, which has taken strong environmental stances in the past, may also use potential ecological consequences as a justification for limiting inward investment, particularly in infrastructure or energy projects. Banking sector reforms may increase opportunities for foreign investment in smaller Italian banks, but there appears to be limited interest at present.

Population growth is projected to come to a virtual halt
Having declined for several years in the late 1990s, Italy's total population increased moderately in 1999-2011, rising by an average of 0.3% per year. Since then the population has resumed its decline, falling to 59.4m in 2017, according to the UN's population estimates. The fall was mainly driven by the natural decline of the Italian population outpacing immigration. This trend is likely to continue, as the expectation of scarce job opportunities due to the weakness of the economy has probably reduced the influx of immigrants and driven further emigration of young Italians. The Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S)-Lega government's tough stance on immigration may further discourage foreigners from settling in Italy. Since the EU's March 2016 agreement with Turkey, the flow of migrants from Turkey to Greece and on to northern Europe has more or less ceased, but this has coincided with a sharp increase in migrant flows to Italy. Migrant inflows have fallen sharply in 2018. This is partly due to stepped-up collaboration with the Libyan authorities, but also to the inflexible stance of the M5S-Lega administration and of the Maltese authorities, which appears to be deterring migrant vessels from seeking to cross the central Mediterranean. In the past most migrants arriving in Italy moved on to other EU countries, notably Germany.
According to Istat (the national statistics office), the proportion of foreign residents in the total population has increased steadily in recent years, from 4.5% in 2005 to 8% at end-2013 and 8.3% at end-2017, unchanged from the previous year. The majority of immigrants live in the north and the centre of Italy, where foreign residents accounted for 10.6% of the population at end-2017 (latest available data), up from about 10% in 2013. However, growth in the number of foreign nationals residing in the south has begun to outpace that in the north and the centre in recent years. The three largest national groups are Romanians, Albanians and Moroccans, who together account for about 40% of the total number of foreign residents. Even during periods of modest economic growth, shortages of skilled and even unskilled workers are likely to re-emerge in areas of high employment such as the north east, owing to deficiencies in the labour market.
Although almost 70% of Italians live in urban areas, the population is widely dispersed among numerous small cities and towns. As a result, local markets tend to be diffused and relatively small in scale. The combined population of Italy's three largest cities-Rome (the capital), Milan and Naples-accounts for less than 10% of the country's total population, although if the outer suburbs are included, the three main urban areas account for about 20% of the total population.
Reforms seek to increase labour mobility
The steady rise in the employment rate (the percentage of people aged 20-64 in employment) since the mid-1990s came to a halt in 2008. At 62.3% in 2016, just below the 62.9% employment rate in 2008, according to Eurostat, it was 10 percentage points lower than the EU28 average and the third-lowest rate in the EU. The reasons for this include cultural factors, but also the low effective retirement age and limited mobility from areas of high unemployment in the south to those of high employment in the north. Low labour mobility has been perpetuated to a large extent by the greater use of temporary employment contracts, especially for young workers, poor active labour market policies and an inadequate system of unemployment benefits. The labour market reforms approved since 2012 aim to address some of these issues gradually during the forecast period (2018-22). In spite of the projected decline in the working-age population during the forecast period, the labour force will increase moderately. This will be attributable to greater female participation as well as pension reforms, which have reduced the incentive for early retirement.
The rise in proportion of elderly will put pressure on pensions and healthcare
During the forecast period the number of people of working age will be considerably lower than the number of people reaching 65. As a result, Italy's old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of people aged over 65 to those of working age) will rise further. At an estimated 34.8% in 2017, it is the highest in the EU, and will continue to rise. This trend, combined with the continued rise in life expectancy, will continue to put upward pressure on public expenditure on pensions and care for the elderly. Italy's public pension spending has been on a steadily rising trend and is among the highest in the EU as a share of GDP. According to figures from the Ministry of the Economy, public pension spending is projected to decline gradually over the next ten years, from a peak of about 16% in 2013-14, owing to a series of reforms introduced since the beginning of the 1990s. This trend could slow marginally, however, if the M5S-Lega government is successful in undoing the 2011 Fornero pension reform, the most recent effort to improve the social security system's sustainability.

Italy is a major market, but growth potential remains limited
Italy is one of the largest markets in Europe, with a population of just under 60m, and is one of its most affluent nations. However, growth potential remains limited because the country is a mature consumer market with weak income and population growth prospects.
In 2015 the economy began to emerge from a protracted recession. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the recovery to continue during the forecast period (2018-22) but domestic demand growth will remain subdued, given high unemployment, weak business investment, the ongoing need for fiscal consolidation in Italy, high taxation and moderate wage growth.
In terms of private consumption per head, Italy is just below the euro area average, but well below Finland, Sweden, France and Germany. However, the relative weakness of Italian economic growth for much of the past 15-20 years means that GDP per head-at purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion rates that explicitly adjust for differences in price levels between countries-has fallen steadily as a percentage of the EU28 average, remaining below 100% since 2013. GDP per head at PPP rates stood at US$39,169 in 2016 and an estimated US$40,260 last year. Income levels differ greatly on a regional basis, with GDP per head in the south about 46% of that in the north. Development policies in the past 50 years have done little to close the gap.

Despite relatively high income levels, spending on food, beverages and tobacco is still high as a share of total consumer spending, at about 18%-just above the level in France but above that in the Netherlands (about 15%), Germany (13.9%) and the UK (12%). We expect it to decline only gradually during the forecast period, largely because of subdued spending on other categories of goods and services.
Consumer credit demand has begun to rise, after several years of stagnation and/or contraction. Household indebtedness is relatively low and interest rates on consumer loans have declined and are expected to rise only moderately in 2018-22, containing the proportion of disposable income spent on debt servicing. Still, we expect only moderately stronger demand for big-ticket items and branded goods, as consumers are likely to postpone purchases until sen-timent improves further and risks to the recovery diminish. Rates of ownership of traditional consumer durable goods, such as white goods and passenger cars, are generally high, so demand will be driven by technological change and the need to replace ageing stock.
Demand for electronic goods, such as computers (especially laptops and tablets) and smartphones, has shown a tendency to outperform the rest of the consumer goods market. Growth will be driven by innovations such as smartphones, tablet computers and, more recently, wearable technology. However, weak income growth will dampen demand. Personal computer (PC) access lags well behind countries such as the UK and Germany, where the penetration rate is above 90% of households, and France, where it is about 84%, compared with about 73% in Italy.
The ageing population will drive growth in healthcare spending
Demographic trends will have an important impact on spending patterns. The ageing population will continue to drive overall healthcare spending, but we expect efforts to curb public healthcare expenditure to meet budgetary targets.
Italians tend to live at home with their parents, often until their mid-thirties. Thus, a larger portion of the disposable income of those aged 18-35 has tended to be spent on leisure and consumer goods than in other countries, although this trend is likely to be offset by low salaries for many young people who have work and one of the highest youth unemployment rates (among the 15-24 age group) in Europe, despite declining gradually in recent years. In June 2018 it was 32.6%, down from a peak of 43.5% in March 2014-almost double pre-crisis levels in 2007-08.

Initial conditions: Italy's economic growth performance has been poor in the past two decades, even in comparison with the sluggish average rate of growth achieved by core countries within the EU. Besides undergoing severe fiscal consolidation during the 1990s in order to join the euro area, which dampened growth in that decade, the Italian economy has suffered from a steady loss of competitiveness owing to low productivity growth and rising unit labour costs (reflecting falling output, despite wage moderation since 1993)-in contrast to the situation in its main trading partners.
The weakness of Italy's political and institutional framework policy hinders policy formulation, as reforms are frequently delayed or watered down under pressure from a wide range of interest groups. The current administration has denounced the emphasis on structural reforms advocated by the EU and, at least nominally, espoused by previous governments. It may undo some of the meagre progress made in recent years and is unlikely to enact policy changes that will improve the country's competitiveness. Italy's public finances also remain weak, limiting the scope to reduce taxation or stimulate demand during cyclical downturns. Major brakes on Italy's long-term growth will be the country's unfavourable demographic profile, low labour participation rates, a collapse in fixed investment during the recent recession, and low levels of investment in research and development (R&D).
Unfavourable demographic trends will weigh on long-term growth
Demographic trends: Italy's demographic profile is particularly unfavourable. Projected net immigration is expected to be insufficient to halt the continued decline in the working-age population in the long-term forecast period up to 2050. Italy's labour market participation rate is expected to rise from current low levels of about 66%, but only moderately, reflecting an increase in the number of women joining the workforce and a gradual rise in the minimum retirement age, but it will remain well below the OECD average (about 72% in 2017) and will be insufficient to prevent an annual average decline in the labour force of 0.6% in 2018-50.
External conditions: The effects of the global crisis of 2008-09 and the height of the euro area crisis in 2010-13 will be felt for years. The risk that the sovereign debt crisis in financially stressed peripheral countries in the euro area, including Italy, will lead to a partial or even complete break-up of the single currency area, which would have severe negative consequences for Italy's long-term economic prospects, has eased, but The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that it is more likely than not that Greece will leave the euro area by the end of our forecast period. Even without Greece in the euro area, the euro zone member states are still a long way from resolving the structural shortcomings of the single currency area, and the rhetoric of the Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S)-Lega government risks provoking instances of market volatility, particularly as European Central Bank (ECB) support through quantitative easing (QE) is phased out at end-2018.
Italian companies have generally been slow to adapt to the rigours of fixed exchange rates in the euro area and the increase in competition from goods produced in low-cost developing countries, although some traditional manufacturing sectors have undergone restructuring in recent years, notably textiles and clothing, and also automotive. This difficulty seems unlikely to change in the medium to long term. In the past, clusters of family-owned small and medium-sized export-oriented manufacturing companies located in the so­called industrial districts in the north and centre of the country showed greater flexibility and ability to adapt to changing external conditions than Italy's few large companies. However, more recently they have struggled to compete in some low- to medium-technology sectors. This is attributed to the lack of investment in R&D and innovation and marketing, as well as to difficulties in protecting and promoting the generic ''Made in Italy" brand, which has long been considered synonymous with good quality and style. To survive, Italian companies will have to expand in size and increasingly outsource low-value-added production to locations in central and eastern Europe and Asia, where costs-especially labour costs-are lower. The reluctance to relinquish control will hinder the expansion of family-owned businesses, which also often face difficult choices in terms of management succession.
With institutional change off the agenda, economic reform will be slow
Institutions and policy trends: Italy's poor growth performance has raised concerns among policymakers about the country's future economic prospects. Policy responses triggered by such debates in the past have generally been short lived. Some reforms have been introduced since the financial turmoil of late 2011. However, popular and political resistance to reform halted the Renzi government's attempt to overhaul Italy's institutional framework in 2014-16, taking institutional change off the political agenda for the foreseeable future. Without a substantial improvement in its political and institutional framework, Italy's efforts to carry out reforms will continue to lag the rapid pace of change in the world economy and the increase in competition. The M5S-Lega administration, which campaigned forcefully against the constitutional reform, has no intention of pursuing further institutional changes and will seek to loosen fiscal consolidation marginally and soften recent structural reforms.
In particular, Italy will need further liberalisation of its product and services markets, although recent reforms, if they are not reversed, should help to reduce labour market rigidities over the medium to long term. A more comprehensive system of unemployment protection envisaged under the 2012 and 2014 reforms could help to enhance labour mobility, but there may be a lack of resources without more drastic cuts in public spending on pensions, which is projected to ease from a peak of just under 16% of GDP in 2013-14 to just above 15% in 2019, according to the Treasury (before rising again until the late 2040 and falling again sharply thereafter). The M5S-Lega government has vowed to roll back the most recent reform, passed in 2011, which could lead to a deterioration in the pension spending profile. To raise long-term productivity growth, the country will also have to improve the quality of human capital. Recent education reforms have sought to address shortcomings in the education system, including high drop-out rates and mismatches between the skills needed by employers and qualifications held by potential employees.
A more favourable policy environment would boost long-term growth
Long-term performance: Our baseline forecast is that Italian GDP growth will average 0.6% per year in 2018-50, which is considerably weaker than what was until recently considered to be Italy's trend rate of growth (1.5%). The main brake on long-term growth will be an unfavourable demographic profile, which will be offset only partly by expected moderate improvements in labour productivity and technological infrastructure. Other industrialised countries will continue to grow faster than Italy, and so it will fall further behind in terms of GDP per head, which in the decade to 2017 fell from 107% of the EU28 average to 96%. In addition, decades of massive public-sector spending have done little to narrow the large income gap between the more developed centre and north of Italy and the south of the country. This imbalance is expected to continue to weigh on Italy's overall growth performance in the long term. A more favourable political environment could produce a better economic growth performance in the long term, but the chance of improvements in Italy's institutional framework being implemented in the short to medium term is limited.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends
Climate change and sustainability
Climate change is expected to have a moderate, but clearly negative effect on Italian living standards and the economy. Hotter summers increase the risk of drought, particularly in the country's southern and island regions, in many parts of which water is scarce. This will have an impact on food crops and agricultural production, and could affect human health, as well. In 2017 six of 20 Italian regions called on the government to declare a state of emergency owing to water stress. In addition to putting traditional agricultural products such wine grapes at risk, an increased incidence of drought will also heighten the risk of wildfires. Italy has about 7,600 km of coastline, and rising sea levels could put some low-lying coastal areas of the country at risk of flooding. Rising seas will be particularly problematic for the city of Venice, a major tourist destination, and more erratic weather patterns are likely to strain ageing infrastructure.
Technological developments
Despite Italy's sizeable manufacturing base and the presence of some notable high-technology firms, technological uptake has been limited, constrained in part by small average firm size and family management, which in some cases limits innovation. In 2017-18 a representative survey of nearly 24,000 industrial firms conducted by the Ministry of Economic Development found that only 8.4% had implemented technologies associated with "Industry 4.0", or the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing, such as 3D printing, the Internet of Things, Cloud technologies, or Big Data analytics. The share rises sharply, from 6% of firms with fewer than ten employees, to about 47% of firms with 250 employees or more. In 2016 research and development (R&D) spending accounted for just 1.3% of GDP-well below the EU average of 2%. Meanwhile the trade balance of high-technology goods stood at -0.54% of GDP in 2015 (latest data available). Since 2016, a series of tax credits and deductions known as Impresa 4.0 has been introduced to encourage investment in R&D and productivity-enhancing technologies, but a higher level of direct support and possibly an upskilling of the labour force may be necessary to take full advantage of technological advances. Persons with a tertiary degree or employed in science and technology account for about 33% of total employment, while higher education suffers from relatively high dropout rates and long university completion times.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2013-17) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2018-22). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2013-17. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2018-22 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2013-17 ranges are then used to derive 2018-22 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2018-22, not to the likely situation in 2022 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2015 or 2020). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Thailand--highlights: Political outlook
The military-led government will remain in complete control until the next general election, which The Economist Intelligence Unit expects to be held in 2019. The new constitution (approved by the public in a referendum in 2016), which will be adopted under a newly elected government, will allow the military to maintain significant influence over executive and legislative affairs in 2018-22. The military's overarching influence will ensure political stability for most of the forecast period. However, organised, but non-violent, challenges to government cannot be ruled out, particularly later in the forecast period.

Thailand's business environment score rises in 2018-22, helping to improve its global ranking to 38th, from 40th in 2013-17. Its regional position remains at ninth out of 17 countries. The macroeconomic environment will stabilise, although it will remain vulnerable to external conditions. We expect improvements in policies towards private enterprise and competition and towards foreign investment. The overall tax regime will remain stable and accommodative to business. Trade liberalisation will continue, with growing integration among Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) members and other countries in Asia. Long-overdue construction on a number of transport infrastructure projects will also get under way, resulting in significant gains in that area for business.

We forecast that Thailand's real GDP will expand by 4% on average in 2018, and growth will average 3.4% a year in 2018-22, compared with 2.8% in 2013-17, owing in large part to stronger external demand. Public investment in infrastructure development will also lend considerable support to growth in the early part of the forecast period. Private consumption will remain under pressure owing to high household debt. Nonetheless, a clearer political path following the elections in 2019 will reassure investors, helping to boost growth in the later years of the forecast period as a cyclical upswing in external demand takes root again. The tourism sector will remain a key support for the economy throughout 2018-22.

Population growth   0.3 0.2
Working-age population growth   0.2 -0.2
Labour force growth   -0.7 0.3
The rate of population growth will slow in the forecast period as a result of effective family-planning programmes, sex education and changing social norms, such as later marriages and smaller families. Continuing improvement in the prevention and treatment of infectious disease will contribute to a rising life expectancy and a growing share of the population over 65 years old. However, owing to a shortage of formal job opportunities in neighbouring countries, migrant labour from Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos will continue to grow in absolute terms. This will serve to boost the labour force in 2018-22, against the trend of a gradually declining domestic workforce.

Household consumption per head (US$) 3,220 3,500 3,560 3,590 3,820 3,990
Thailand is a sizeable market in its own right, with a population of 69m and nominal GDP equivalent to US$455.5bn at market exchange rates in 2017. The retail sector will create market opportunities, in large part owing to the continuing strength of the tourism sector. Although the current and next government will try to rely less on fiscal handouts, which have boosted household purchasing power in recent years, they will have to maintain supportive policies for key interest groups in order to ensure political stability. Household debt will remain a dampener on consumer sentiment in the forecast period, but a tax regime increasingly focused on wealth, rather than income and consumption, will avoid crimping private consumption growth further.

Growth of real GDP per head 2.9 2.4 2.6

The long-term outlook for Thailand's economy hinges heavily on the assumption that governments in the next ten years will possess greater political power than their predecessors to enact and continue structural reforms, as well as develop infrastructure. Such reforms will improve the business environment and raise productivity. However, there will be persistent delays, owing to fiscal constraints and difficulties in attracting foreign investment amid strong regional competition. Thailand's demographic profile will also start to have a significant, negative impact on GDP growth from the 2030s.

Background: Following a revolution in 1932, Thailand's absolute monarchy was replaced with a constitutional monarchy. While the elected government gained prominence, democracy was turbulent and subject to several coups (19 have been staged since 1932). The latest coup took place in May 2014, when the democratically elected government led by Yingluck Shinawatra was removed following months of protests and political turmoil. The Shinawatra family gained prominence in Thai politics in 2001 when Thaksin Shinawatra, a businessman-turned-politician and Yingluck's older brother, was elected prime minister. He remained in office until 2006, when he was removed by a coup. Thaksin was a populist leader, and his political prominence created a divide between the rural population in the northern provinces and the urban rich of the south. This rift is a lasting consequence of Thai democracy and has emerged from income inequality between the rural and urban parts of the country. Although the junta remains firmly in control of government, a return to a limited form of democracy is likely to give way to renewed rivalry between the two camps.
Political structure: The military officers who comprise the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO, the formal name for the junta), led by Prayuth Chan-ocha as prime minister, control an interim government made up of a 200-member National Legislative Assembly (parliament), a 35-member cabinet and a 250-member reform council. The members of these bodies were appointed by the NCPO and are mainly military officers. The king remains the symbolic head of state. Following the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in October 2016, the crown prince, Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, ascended the throne.
Policy issues: The military-led government will focus on improving the investment environment in Thailand and head a public-investment drive in infrastructure in an effort to boost the country's long-term economic performance. The junta's continuing grip on power will reassure many foreign investors deterred by potential instability, but growing regional competition will detract from Thailand's attractiveness as an investment destination.
Taxation: Corporate income tax stands at 20%. Tax concessions are available for firms that list on the stockmarket. Value-added tax (VAT) stands at 7%. Personal income tax rises to 35% on annual taxable earnings exceeding Bt5m (US$150,000).
Foreign trade: Thailand recorded a merchandise trade surplus (fob-fob) of US$31.9bn in 2017, down from US$36.5bn in 2016. However, the current-account surplus stood at US$48.1bn in 2017, mostly unchanged from US$48.2 in 2016.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
The military rules the country via a junta known as the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), led by the former army chief and current prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha. The military coup in May 2014 led to the dissolution of the House of Representatives (parliament) elected in 2011. The NCPO appointed an interim National Legislative Assembly in its place in August 2014, consisting mainly of security officers and civilians supportive of the military. A 250-member National Reform Council, which is tasked with recommending reforms and approving a new charter, was also appointed. A new constitution was approved in a public referendum in August 2016, paving the way for fresh elections but also sealing the considerable influence of the military on the next government. However, the NCPO's planned path back to elections has been delayed by the death in late 2016 of the previous king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, and pending coronation of the new monarch, Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, as well as the slow passage of legislation relating to the new charter. The accession process has not been destabilising, partly owing to the military government's imperative to sustain the royal institution in order to legitimise its own political role. Nonetheless, the king's prominent place in Thai society will slowly diminish in coming years, as the new monarch fails to command the same level of reverence among the public that his father did.
Political outlook: Political stability
The NCPO will control the legislature until the elections, which The Economist Intelligence Unit expects to take place by mid-2019. The junta used the passing of King Bhumibol in 2016 and the subsequent royal succession as a means to postpone the return to some form of democratic system. However, any further delays will be more difficult to justify. The incidence of small-scale protests has also been rising; although most of them have not been directly related to the political situation, they do indicate an increasing unwillingness to capitulate to the military's stance against public demonstrations and political activity.
The junta has maintained strict oversight and censorship of the mass media and public debate, in an attempt to suppress dissent. It is likely to lift most of these restrictions before end-2018 in preparation for elections. Nonetheless, the junta's clampdown on freedom of speech and association is exacerbating public discontent with the current political situation. This increases the risk of large-scale public protests, especially if further indications of abuse of power by officials come to light. However, such an event still remains outside our core forecast.
A new constitution, approved in a public referendum in 2016, has cemented the military's continued influence over the government even after the next ballot. The rule of King Maha, who succeeded his much-revered late father, will have a minimal impact on political stability in 2018-22. The military establishment depends on royal endorsement for much of its political legitimacy. It has therefore ensured the continuance of the monarchy in line with the wishes of the late king and has proactively suppressed criticism of the new king via lese-majesty laws. This will continue under the current military government and, to a lesser extent, under the next administration.
King Maha has already sought to consolidate his position in the political sphere by tailoring to his preference rules concerning the delegation of the monarch's authority and control over the royal estate. Although some of these alterations indicate a slightly stronger foundational role in politics than in the previous charter, in practice royal intrusion into everyday politics will remain rare. Indeed, many of the changes were simply aimed at ensuring that the king could continue to reside outside the country for long periods without having to delegate his powers. Similarly, the transfer of royal assets from the Crown Property Bureau to the direct control of the King, announced in June, is probably an effort to further secure and delegate his power among only his closest allies.
The election of a new government will be accepted with little open resistance in the light of the 2016 constitutional referendum result. However, if strict rules prohibiting criticism of the authorities are carried over under the next govern-ment, the risk of political instability will rise markedly. This risk would already be high given the maintenance of the military's overtly central role in the political system; the Senate (the upper house of parliament) will be dominated by figures linked to the military. Therefore, challenges to the next government-in the form of political boycotts and protests-cannot be ruled out. Such challenges are more likely to occur towards the end of the forecast period, especially if the next government fails to preside over a robust and inclusive economic recovery. A significant economic downturn is not our core forecast, however. Moreover, the risk of armed civil conflict remains negligible, and any major stands against the next government and its constitutionally dictated set-up are likely to be headed by non-military political factions.
The insurgency in the Muslim-dominated southern provinces of Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat will rage on beyond the elections. This will consist of small-scale attacks targeting security forces and-occasionally-religious sites frequented by civilians. These will include sporadic attacks within agreed safe-zone areas, owing to the proliferation of insurgent groups outside the MARA Pattani, an umbrella group for six separatist movements in southern Thailand. However, the insurgency presents only a minimal threat to overall political stability. The possibility of the insurgency expanding significantly and spreading to other parts of the country remains low. We therefore do not expect the situation to threaten Thailand's important tourism sector in 2018-22.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
The outlook for political and institutional effectiveness is more certain in the wake of public approval of the junta-drafted constitution and the smooth accession of the new king. Unlike the previous government, which faced major street demonstrations and legal challenges in opposition to its policies, the junta possesses near-absolute power to implement its agenda as a transitional government until the next elections. Moreover, regardless of the subsequent poll results, the military establishment has sealed overarching influence over the next government via the new charter.
The new constitution outlines an administrative structure that is formed with a larger proportion of appointed officials than previously. Moreover, rules in the constitution for the appointment of a prime minister mean that it is likely that these appointed officials will join their publicly elected counterparts in selecting an individual for the position. This is likely to result in the selection of a military-preferred candidate for prime minister. This will allow the military to dominate government decision-making, while curtailing the power of democratically elected officials. Although such changes are likely to expedite the policymaking process, they bode ill for the public accountability of government.
The NCPO has appointed technocrats to manage the economy and is determined to outline a long-term strategy for the country in addition to its short- to medium-term focus on reviving investment and private consumption. Its proposed 20-year "National Strategy" is currently being drafted and the next government will be constitutionally bound to follow it, under the explicit threat of impeachment. It is already clear that infrastructure development is likely to be a core supporting strategy within it, to sustain primary goals including rebalancing public- and private-sector development, and special economic zone development.
Nevertheless, in the near term the junta is likely still to devote significant resources to populist policies when needed to appease key interest groups, such as agricultural producers. Avoiding inflaming future political tensions will remain a key underlying priority. However, the military has not made any material progress in reconciling the political differences between the rural population of the north (who supported Thaksin) and the elite in southern Thailand (who are represented by his detractors, the Democrat Party). Therefore, although the military-appointed component of the next government will enjoy efficacy in policymaking, it will still find it difficult to satisfy the two major camps and may face rising opposition from one or both in the medium term-the same tensions that have plagued its predecessors.
Corruption will remain a significant problem in many of the country's institutions, including the military. Cases under the next government involving unelected officials, particularly those with explicit military links, may serve as a flashpoint for discontent over the new constitutional system and its lack of accountability. If open discontent does materialise it is more likely to be from a cumulative series of incidents and thus occur later in the forecast period. Continuing corruption in the local police force allows the capital, Bangkok, to host one of the world's largest shadow economies. The junta has made efforts to show a tougher stance against corruption, for instance by setting up a dedicated court to try relevant cases and proposing the death penalty for the involvement of high-level officials, as well as for foreigners, in graft. However, similar initiatives have been popular with past military governments and have shown little progress. There is little reason to believe that the junta and the next government will be any more successful in clamping down on corrupt activities.
Political outlook: Election watch
After numerous delays relating to the drafting of new "organic laws" under the new constitution in 2017 and early 2018, the prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, subsequently confirmed that elections would be held in early 2019. We believe that polls will be held in that year, as the possibility of further postponement is tempered by rising public unrest. This has reduced the junta's motivation to delay the poll yet again, for fear of provoking large-scale demonstrations. The junta will want to avoid a forceful clampdown on protesters, as this would undermine attempts by senior military officials to portray themselves as legitimate political actors in the reformed political system and the next government.
Political outlook: International relations
Western countries are gradually restoring relations with Thailand for the sake of economic ties and in response to wider concerns about China's political influence in the region, despite continuing rule by military government. The administration of the US president, Donald Trump, has led a partial rapprochement between Thailand and the US, culminating in a state visit by Prayuth in October 2017. Subsequent meetings between Prayuth and Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron, the prime minister and president of the UK and France respectively, further attest to this trend of reconcilement. Notably, however, the EU's Foreign Affairs Council has reiterated that although political ties have been re-established, talks on a free-trade agreement (FTA) between the bloc and the kingdom will not resume until the return of a civilian government. We expect the complete normalisation of Thailand's ties with governments in the West following the next election, despite the significant influence that the military will retain over the next, nominally civilian government.
Japan, which is wary of being superseded by China (with regard to large-scale investment projects), has demonstrated a willingness to preserve most diplomatic engagement and continue bilateral FTA negotiations with Thailand during the junta's rule. This means that major economic co-operation deals between the two countries will go ahead regardless, including infrastructure projects to be built under Japanese contracts.
Nonetheless, China's influence in Thailand will continue to grow in 2018-22, especially in the early part of the forecast period, while the government is under full military control. The two countries have no conflicting territorial claims in the South China Sea and are important trading partners. Economic ties are set to strengthen further as Thailand focuses on forging bilateral deals between state-owned enterprises under its public investment drive. However, this growing relationship will not be without its setbacks, as illustrated by the stop-start progress of the planned China-Laos-Thailand high-speed rail project. Such tussles will delay the economic benefits of greater regional integration.
Notably, increasing bilateral co-operation with China seems unlikely to obstruct Thailand's ongoing efforts to engage with its neighbours in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). This is in part because tensions between other ASEAN members and China in relation to territorial disputes in the South China Sea have eased.

Thailand's business environment score increases from 6.40 in 2013-17 to 6.74 in 2018-22. In The Economist Intelligence Unit's global rankings, Thailand improves from 40th to 38th place, but its position in the Asia-Pacific region remains at ninth out of 17 countries. The score for political environment will improve. Although significant risks will remain, political stability will be maintained for much of the forecast period, including after the next government comes to power in 2019. This is in large part because the military's central role in the subsequent government will stifle any partisan conflicts and improve political effectiveness. Separatist violence in the south will continue and is unlikely to dissipate before the end of the forecast period. The risk of unrest permanently spreading to other parts of the country is low, however.
The macroeconomic environment will stabilise in the forecast period, although it will remain vulnerable to external conditions. An improvement in the scores for policy towards private enterprise and competition and policy towards foreign investment under an elected government will encourage a moderate uptick in investment. This will be aided by an open capital account and a relatively stable currency. However, lacklustre domestic demand will continue to be a major drag on business sentiment, with high household debt weighing on private consumption prospects. The Bank of Thailand (BOT, the central bank) will remain independent and monetary policy will be fairly conservative. Ambitious transport infrastructure projects boost the score for infrastructure by the largest increment of all the categories, as a drive to make comprehensive improvements to the country's transport capacities gets underway.

Business environment outlook: Thailand's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: The authorities reorganise the management of several state-owned enterprises but do not sell off significant assets.
2020-22: Thailand remains on the US Trade Representative's intellectual property rights (lower priority) watchlist, despite an improvement in enforcement.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: The government provides lucrative incentives for investment in several high value-added subsectors in the new Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) special economic zone spanning three provinces south-east of the capital, Bangkok.
2020-22: Opposition to the sale of assets to foreigners persists, particularly in the utilities sector. Rules allowing full foreign property ownership in the EEC provinces spur a boom in real estate investment there.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Administrative procedures for trade transactions with other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) are streamlined amid efforts to step up integration of the ASEAN Economic Community.
2020-22: Negotiations on an EU-Thailand pact and on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement between ASEAN and Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea enter the final stages.
Taxes
2018-19: New land and property taxes are introduced from 2019. The government sanctions income tax deductions on domestic hotel and travel expenses during a limited period of the year again.
2020-22: The government raises slightly the rate of value-added tax (VAT) from the current level of 7%. Inheritance tax laws are revised to expand their coverage, providing a boost to government revenue.
Financing
2018-19: The authorities continue to focus on expanding the local bourse, opening equity financing options to more firms.
2020-22: Commercial banks based in other ASEAN countries begin to offer retail services in Thailand under the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework.
The labour market
2018-19: The average provincial minimum wage rises in 2018 but low inflation allows the authorities to delay further increases. A clampdown on unregistered migrants affects the availability of low-skilled labour in the short term.
2020-22: Shortages of skilled labour increase, driving up costs in service industries in particular. The government loosens immigration controls on foreign skilled workers.
Infrastructure
2018-19: The expansion of road and rail infrastructure progresses slowly, providing a boost to the construction sector.
2020-22: Completion of the Thailand section of the China-Laos-Thailand railway is delayed. Passenger capacity expansions of Suvarnabhumi and Don Mueang airports in the capital are completed.
Technological readiness
2018-19: The government allows tax deductions for research and development expenditure in strategic sectors.
2020-22: The Board of Investment continues to prioritise projects under the ten listed sectors within the Thailand 4.0 plan.

There will be a slight improvement in Thailand's macroeconomic environment during the forecast period. However, greater improvement in countries outside Asia will see Thailand's global ranking deteriorate from 20th in 2013-17 to 24th in 2017-21. Its regional ranking will remain static, at 6th, over the same period. Relatively low public debt, a firmly positive current-account balance and fairly stable fiscal, monetary and exchange-rate policies will underpin macro-economic stability. After several years of volatility, economic growth has been relatively steady since 2015 and is expected to remain so during 2018-22. Yet a pick-up in growth rates on a par with its peers in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) will prove elusive. This will be mainly owing to the increasing competition from other ASEAN countries in key high-value merchandise export industries.
The economy will stabilise in 2018-22, compared with 2013-17
The military's control of government has allowed for more rapid approval of policy, including major spending plans. Up until elections in 2019 the junta will continue to use its unchecked powers to fast-track policymaking and the approval of projects, including intermittent populist policies to appease influential interest groups such as agricultural producers. Furthermore, under the constitution approved in 2016, it will be able to exert considerable influence on policymaking following the next elections, which we expect to take place in 2019. This will help to ensure that business-oriented tax reform and investment incentives are maintained and expanded in 2018-22, and that major infrastructure investment projects continue beyond the end of the forecast period. Private investment will continue to struggle in the early part of the forecast period, but this will be counterbalanced by public investment in major infrastructure projects that will act as economic stimulus. The growing tourism sector will also provide strong support to domestic demand, particularly in the services sector.
Unlike previous post-coup governments, the junta directly manages important economic portfolios (including the Board of Investment, or BOI, which provides investment incentives). It is expected to continue to exert considerable indirect influence on these following the next elections via its 20-year "National Strategy", which is likely to influence the nature of investment via its priori-tisation of certain industries. The governor of the BOT, Veerathai Santiprabhob, who took the reins in October 2015, is well respected and there is so far no indication that he will bend to political pressure. This should ensure that the BOT remains independent and credible in its regulation of the financial sector and its management of the economy (particularly in setting official interest rates and acting to reduce excess volatility of the local currency, the baht).

We expect a moderate improvement in policy towards private enterprise and competition as the government makes more aggressive efforts to attract investment. This will help Thailand's global ranking to improve from 36th in 2013-17 to 32nd in 2018-22. However, the country's regional rank will remain unchanged owing to concurrent improvements in other Asian countries. The military government has launched an anti-graft campaign, including a new court dedicated to trying corruption cases. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of cases involving officials linked to the current administration despite allegations of graft, suggesting that anti-corruption efforts are not insulated from political influence. Furthermore, the favouritism for politically connected businesses under the previous administration led by Yingluck Shinawatra may have been replaced by another patronage system that rewards those allied to the military and the traditional establishment.
Privatisation of SOEs will proceed at a gradual pace
Proposed reforms to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) will bolster the operational efficiency of state companies. However, privatisation remains a sensitive issue, and it is unlikely that the military-led government or its successor will try to sell off state assets, as this would redistribute economic rents away from current holders and there is little public support for this. A long-standing area of concern is the lack of protection of intellectual property (IP), but a recent upgrading of legal provisions should help to control piracy of digital and online content. The government will continue to use price controls for some basic goods to keep them affordable; prices for goods on the "sensitive" list cannot be changed without the permission of the Ministry of Commerce.
The corporate governance reform of 56 SOEs controlling assets worth over US$300bn will be completed during the forecast period. In 2014 the military-controlled government appointed a so-called superboard to oversee the reform. Another superboard, designed to oversee procurement processes, was esta-blished in 2017. The formation of these bodies may help to curb corruption in the public sector, although progress in this area is likely to be slow. A new law that will restructure SOEs and reform key parts of their business processes is likely to also be passed in the early part of the forecast period. This will expand and improve procurement processes, including increasing transparency, which will help to reduce corruption and boost competition in the public-private sphere. All of these initiatives are unlikely to be reversed following new elections, as they look likely to be included in the junta-developed, constitutionally binding 20-year National Strategy.
Following the passage of a new Copyright Act in 2015, which focuses on improving protection of IP rights on the internet, and the earlier creation of a National Committee on Intellectual Property under the prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, the US Trade Representative moved Thailand from its intellectual property Priority Watch List to its lesser Watch List status in late 2017. Thailand had been on the highest-concern list for a decade, so the downgrade should give investors some reassurance of progress in this area. Nonetheless, the still-prevalent relatively frequent occurrence of IP infringement will hinder the country's progress towards becoming a "digital economy" and act as a disincentive to international brands looking to do business in Thailand.

The score for policy towards foreign investment will improve moderately in 2018-22, compared with the historical period, raising both the regional and global rankings. Thailand will continue to encourage inward investment, especially in higher-value-added industries. Further incentives are almost certain to be rolled out in 2018-22 and investment approvals will continue to be fast-tracked by the BOI. The government will not revive proposals, first touted in 2007, to amend the Foreign Business Act, which would make it more difficult for foreign companies to control Thai entities unless they own a majority of shares.
The BOI's seven-year investment promotion strategy, launched in 2015, offers incentives and government support for foreign investors. It dovetails with the government's longer-term "Thailand 4.0" industrial policy in its sectoral focus. The investment promotion strategy includes incentives for setting up a business in less developed parts of the country and the promotion of ten special economic zones (SEZs) along the land borders of Thailand and its neighbours. The latter are in place to take advantage of increasing international labour flows under the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), which was formally established in late 2015. Incentives in the ten SEZs include corporate income tax breaks in certain industries.
Incentives offered to foreign investment will increase
In addition to the ten border SEZs in development, a large coastal-situated economic zone in the form of the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) has also been designated, capitalising on an existing industrial belt along the eastern seaboard. Significant incentives will be provided for firms in the border SEZs, including double tax deductions on some utilities for a ten-year period, access to cheap credit and the granting of use of unskilled foreign labour from neigh-bouring countries. Meanwhile, the EEC will benefit from transport infrastructure upgrades better linking it to the capital, Bangkok, and major air- and seaports, in addition to a range of tax and regulatory incentives.
The promotion strategy will also introduce industrial developments based around the notion of "super-clusters". These will be collective industry hubs (for instance targeting automotive, electrical appliances, chemicals, digital, food production and medical industries). The BOI and the Ministry of Finance will provide tax and other incentives. These efforts will be undermined slightly, however, by the below-par prospects for private consumption, which are low by the standards of other countries at Thailand's income level.

Given Thailand's reliance on international trade, the government will retain a favourable foreign-trade regime, trying to accommodate the demands of influential domestic groups inclined towards protectionism while avoiding provoking any retaliation from major export markets. Most import duties for goods from other ASEAN member states have been lifted, following the formation of the AEC at end-2015. Thailand is also party to multilateral trade agreements concluded by the regional grouping, such as those in place with China and India, and a combined agreement with Australia and New Zealand. However, Thailand's existing trade deals allow signatories to exclude a number of sensitive sectors, while also keeping some non-tariff barriers in place. Thailand will continue to adhere to its commitments as a member of the World Trade Organisation. The country has accepted the obligations laid down in the IMF's Article VIII, which stipulates that transactions on the current account should be free of restrictions. Foreign investors do not face restrictions on the repatriation of profits and dividends and the central bank has eased restrictions on outward capital flows. The BOT would reimpose temporary capital controls only if excessive speculative capital flows were judged to be threatening macro-economic stability.
Thailand, along with the other members of ASEAN, will continue to liberalise its trade regime in line with its commitment to implementing the AEC. Freer movement of goods, services, investment and skilled labour (in eight selected sectors) between the ten member states came into effect at end-2015. Moreover, the progressive implementation of the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS) is resulting in the additional liberalisation of services subsectors; the next AFAS implementation phase in 2019 will result in the opening of subsectors including freight transport, liquefied natural gas tanker maintenance and electronic data transmission services.
Negotiation on a Thailand-EU FTA will resume
Free-trade agreements (FTAs) signed by ASEAN with China and India, as well as a combined agreement with Australia and New Zealand, are gradually being phased in. The deal with India eliminated duties on many products in 2016 and talks are under way to include services. The FTA with Australia and New Zealand will be expanded to include 96% of all product types by 2020. Formal talks on a bilateral FTA between Thailand and the EU began in 2013, but were put on hold after the 2014 coup. European and Thai businesses are keen to conclude a deal, which would compensate in part for Thailand's loss of the EU's Generalised System of Preferences status in 2015. We believe that negotiations will resume only after the next elections, which we forecast to take place in 2019. As a result, a Thai-EU deal is unlikely to be implemented before the end of the forecast period.
The baht has experienced large swings in its value in recent years, as loose monetary policy in the US, Japan and other major economies led to large speculative flows into Thailand in search of higher yields. After a prolonged period of appreciation in 2017, the local currency has seen a depreciating trend since early 2018, amid tax cuts and rising interest rates in the US that has led to a brightening of investor sentiment towards the US economy vis-à-vis emerging markets. The BOT will not reintroduce capital controls to stem this decline in the baht:US dollar exchange rate, partly in preference for a weaker currency to aid exporters. However, intermittent intervention in the foreign-exchange market to curb extreme volatility will remain the norm.

Thailand's score in the taxes category declines marginally in 2018-22, resulting in its global and regional rankings slipping slightly. The deterioration is owing to our expectation that the government will raise value-added tax (VAT) later in the forecast period. Nonetheless, Thailand remains a very competitive territory overall for taxes. The country's tax regime is relatively simple and changes have been made in recent years to lower the overall burden. Successive governments have aimed to minimise the load on households and firms, and lowering taxes has been an important part of this strategy. As a result, its ranking in this area has improved over time (although a relatively low tax-GDP ratio is a fiscal concern in the medium to long term). The standard rate of corporate tax was gradually reduced from 30% in 2011 to 20% in 2013. The government did this with the aim of boosting the country's competitiveness as a destination for foreign investors and to mitigate the impact of higher minimum-wage levels. Tax incentives are also widely available; on the whole, Thailand's fiscal regime continues to provide fairly strong encouragement for new investment, particularly in higher value-added industries that the government considers strategically important. The personal income tax regime is relatively favourable, with the top marginal rate standing at 35% for both Thai and foreign workers on annual earnings over Bt5m (US$145,000).
The VAT rate will be raised slightly towards the end of the forecast period
The junta repeatedly postponed an increase in the standard VAT rate in 2014-17. The next government is likely to maintain the rate at 7% until late in the forecast period, when the authorities will look to consolidate the public finances after private consumption returns to a stronger footing. This decision will also be influenced by calls from international organisations such as the IMF to push the rate back up. In addition, the extension of VAT to digital services provided by foreign companies will be enforced before the end of 2018.
With increases to unpopular consumption taxes off the agenda in the earlier part of the forecast period, the military government will push for other tax reforms to raise revenue and expand the tax base. An inheritance tax was approved in July 2015 and a property tax on land and building assets will come into effect from 2019. The latter will levy tax on commercial land and buildings with a ceiling of 2%, but most applicable tax rates will be much lower than this, and with the highest duties applied to vacant land. The impact on foreign business will therefore be minor.
The government will continue to look for opportunities to provide tax sops in a bid to support consumption. These sops will range from allowing individuals to deduct income tax on purchases of selected consumer goods to income tax deductions for domestic hotel and travel expenses in particular tax years. Similarly, the government will support the real-estate market through subsidised loans and other targeted incentives, such as income tax deductions for first-time buyers in lower-income brackets, during the forecast period.

Thailand's score for financing will improve in 2018-22, as the banking sector will be in better health. However, improvements in the financing environments of neighbouring countries will result in Thailand's regional ranking for the category remaining unchanged. Similarly, an improvement in countries outside the region will see its global ranking slip by one place to 28th, from 27th. Increased due diligence and prudential measures among banks helped to ensure that the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans has remained stable since late 2015. This situation is expected to be sustained in 2018-22. This will bolster the overall health of the banking sector, ensuring that the supply of credit to private firms will not be significantly curtailed at any point during the forecast period.
There will be trend towards consolidation in the financial sector
The BOT and the finance ministry will continue to focus on increasing the competitiveness of the financial sector, principally via the consolidation of a number of private- and state-owned financial institutions, in anticipation of banking services liberalisation under the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework. Thailand is currently in negotiations with Malaysia, Indonesia and Myanmar to lower cross-border banking licence restrictions which will lead to greater competition in the sector, lowering the cost of finance for firms in Thailand. Reforms in this regard will be implemented between Thailand and some more advanced ASEAN neighbours towards the end of the forecast period.
The local bond market will continue to expand under the guidance of the BOT. Thailand's bond market remains small compared with its equity market. Government bonds dominate, accounting for about 80% of all bonds issued, but large and medium debt-laden companies are increasingly using the bond market to refinance their bank loans and offshore borrowings. Strengthening demand in this market will continue in the early part of the forecast period.

The deterioration in the global and regional rankings for the labour market reflects Thailand's waning competitiveness. The country is a labour-scarce economy and unemployment is low. Labour market conditions will, in general, remain adequate in terms of supporting the operations of foreign-invested enterprises, but weaknesses, especially rising wage costs and skill shortages, will persist. The country's advantages as a cost-efficient base for labour-intensive production are diminishing, amid increasing competition from neighbouring economies such as Cambodia and Vietnam. In addition to rising relative costs for low-skilled workers, general labour shortages are a growing problem. In terms of skilled labour, problems stem in large part from Thailand's underperforming education system, which ranks poorly both globally and regionally. Educational reforms in the last two decades have been poorly and inconsistently implemented, and there are currently no plans for a major overhaul of the system. The ability of the labour force to meet the needs of businesses (in terms of specialist skills) is likely to remain subpar by global standards. Hiring foreign workers will continue to be relatively difficult and expensive, except for labour from other ASEAN countries in designated sectors. In terms of the potential for industrial unrest, Thailand is comparatively attractive as an operating location, as strikes are rare.
From January 2017 the nationwide daily minimum-wage schedule was replaced by minimum wages per province. The range of the wage floor was raised to Bt308-330 (around US$9) with effect from April 2018. Significant future increases in the minimum wage are unlikely because this would further damage Thailand's competitiveness vis-à-vis regional competitors. Persistently low con-sumer price inflation in 2018-22 should also ease the upward pressure on wages.
The retirement age will rise incrementally in 2018-22
Thailand is facing the social and economic consequences of a rapidly ageing society, including a steadily declining workforce as a share of the total population. During the forecast period the government will introduce steps to mitigate this crisis. It is drawing up proposals for a staggered increase in the retirement age of civil servants from 60 to 63 years over the next few years. This will invariably put pressure on private employers to follow suit. Accordingly, we expect the average retirement age in the private sector to rise slightly in 2018-22, but this will do little to counter the problems posed by skills shortages on the overall labour market.
Local labour will continue to decline in Thailand, with the country becoming more reliant on migrant workers, mostly from neighbouring Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, who typically fill low-skilled vacancies. The government is in the process of opening SEZs on the country's borders, designed in part to capitalise on the supply of low-cost migrant labour sourced from its neighbours. International concerns for potential human rights abuses in Thailand, especially in the fishing industry, will result in tighter regulation and enforcement of protective measures for migrant workers. Ongoing co-ordination with the Burmese government to register migrants and issue identity documents will help to improve the situation, and will expand access to a (legal) low-cost labour pool in the medium term. However, an accompanying crackdown on migrants without proper documentation will stymie the availability of foreign workers in the outset of the forecast period.

Thailand's infrastructure will see significant improvement in the next five years. The military government has prioritised long-pending "megaprojects", but they will still face significant delays. Improvements to telecommunications services have also been slow. Although the availability of 4G is widespread, average speeds remain slow by regional comparison. Electricity supplies have risen, but the potential for shortages remains. In 2017 60.2% of the country's electricity was generated using natural gas, according to the latest figures from Thailand's Energy Policy and Planning Office, and over 20% of natural gas is imported, making the country vulnerable to fluctuations in global gas prices. With gas supplies in the Gulf of Thailand in decline, the government's energy plans prioritise diversification of energy sources, including development of renewable energy. The government's Power Development Plan 2015 (which will be updated by end-2018) proposes to more than double the capacity of alternative energy sources by 2036, primarily in solar and biomass, and to import additional hydropower from neighbouring nations.
Many large infrastructure projects will enter construction in 2018-22
The government has had difficulty securing funding for its ambitious plans to develop infrastructure "megaprojects". Although the junta has moved a number of projects nearer to the construction phase, including the building of dual-track railways, highways and port expansions, the eventual completion date of a high-speed train linking Thailand and China, via Laos, which was originally agreed in 2010, is still unclear. Construction of a first phase of the line between the Thai capital and the north-eastern province of Nakhon Ratchasima began in mid-2017, but further sections are yet to be greenlighted. This rail project and others have been slow to progress owing to doubts over their commercial viability and wrangling over financing with Chinese and Japanese investors. Delays also partly reflect the government's efforts to take advantage of the ongoing competition for geopolitical influence between China and Japan-the Thai government has both been seeking the best deal and taken a cautious approach to shifting its alliances amid China's growing economic clout and Japan's historical investment links (Japanese FDI into Thailand still dwarfs that from China). We expect significant progress on priority projects in 2018-22, however. This is in large part owing to the junta's use of unilateral executive powers, via Section 44 of the interim constitution, which will set many projects in motion before a new government assumes power. Priority projects include road and rail upgrades on the eastern seaboard to link with Bangkok and the expansion of the U-Tapao International Airport, 140 km south-east of the capital. Many of the key projects undertaken in 2018-22 will serve the new EEC SEZ.
Airport upgrades will ease capacity bottlenecks
The state-run Airports of Thailand authority will upgrade three of the country's major airports in 2018-22 to increase passenger capacity: Don Mueang and Suvarnabhumi airports in Bangkok towards the end of the forecast period, and U-Tapao in Rayong province, southeast of the capital, by 2019. New airports will also be constructed in Chiang Mai and Phuket, although completion is likely to fall beyond the end of the forecast period. This will mainly be aimed at accommodating surging tourist arrivals from East Asia, especially China.
Thailand's telecoms networks have been slow to adopt the latest technology, exposing inefficiencies in the regulatory environment. Auctions of 4G bandwidth were completed in 2017. The regulator expects the commercial launch of 5G bandwidth in 2020, although we believe that those auctions will be completed at a similarly slow pace. Moreover, the new bandwidth is likely to lag behind equivalent offerings in most other Asian countries in terms of speed, as is still the case with 4G, owing to shortfalls in service provider technology.
The Power Development Plan 2015 lays out clear targets for energy production, consumption and imports in the period to 2036. Overall objectives include reducing reliance on natural gas, increasing imports of electricity from Thailand's neighbours, and ramping up alternative energy production, especially solar and biomass. An update to the plan, which will be published later in 2018, is also expected to promote small private power producers. Nuclear power options are still on the table, but have been subject to delays owing to public opposition and no new capacity from this form is expected to be added in the forecast period. As such, Thailand will remain reliant on natural gas for electricity production in 2018-22.

Thailand ranks lower for technological readiness in global comparison in 2018-22 than in the historical period, as there has been no change in its overall score while progress is made in other countries. Its regional rank remains at 11th. A fundamental drag on Thailand's performance is internet use. There were an estimated 37.1 internet users per 100 population in 2017-despite being above the average for other Asian countries such as India (36.5) and Indonesia (27.7), this was well below that of Malaysia (81.2). This limits Thailand's viability for e-commerce and digital services. Its level of commercial innovation also falls below regional par. This is partly owing to the preference of international companies with manufacturing operations in the country to carry out their research and development (R&D) elsewhere. This accounts in part for the low level of patent applications per capita.
Internet use will be boosted by broadband expansion
In 2012 the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society launched the "Smart Thailand" initiative comprising two components-to improve ICT infrastructure under the "Smart Network" project and to upgrade government services under the "Smart Government" project. One of the key objectives under the Smart Network component will be to establish nearly 400,000 free high-speed wireless internet access points around the country and expand broadband internet coverage to 95% of the population. This will boost internet use among the population.
The Board of Investment has introduced import duty exemptions on raw materials used in R&D to incentivise the development of innovative capacities in the private sector. In addition, to boost innovation infrastructure, companies focused on bio-, nano-, advanced materials or digital technology are eligible for up to 13 years of corporate income tax exemption if they co-operate with public research institutions in R&D.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
Thailand's military-controlled government sees economic revival as its priority and is pursuing policies aimed at boosting consumption and investment, including ramping up public spending on infrastructure. This includes the establishment of a large special economic zone, the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), south-east of the capital, Bangkok; it will be based around new and upgraded transport links and will offer significant investment incentives. The admin-istration's sector-specific industrial policy, Thailand 4.0, will also provide additional incentives to foreign investors within and outside the EEC. Both plans fit more broadly with the 20-year National Strategy, the junta's blueprint for the country's long-term social and economic development, which was signed into law in mid-2017. The National Strategy aims to ensure the continuation of the junta's overarching economic policy agenda under future elected administrations.
The junta is also utilising Section 44 of the interim constitution, which allows it to pass legislation unilaterally in order to expedite the development of big-ticket projects. Although this strategy risks fast-tracking projects at the expense of proper public scrutiny, it will accelerate the investment process in the early part of the forecast period and will boost overall economic growth in the short term. Even after the return of an elected government, the constitutionally mandated National Strategy will ensure that public investment remains a policy priority.
Demand-side stimulatory and relief measures have played a prominent role in the junta's policy agenda, in large part to placate agricultural producers who readily protest (or threaten to do so) in order to extract concessions from the government. Such measures are likely to continue and will also focus on small and medium-sized enterprises. Nonetheless, the impetus for further such disbursements will lessen in 2018-22 as the authorities seek to consolidate the public finances.

Government revenue 15.2 16.3 17.7 17.8 18.5 18.4
Budget balance -3.5 -2.9 -2.5 -2.8 -2.7 -2.5
We expect the budget deficit to average the equivalent of 2.7% of GDP per year in 2018-22. The junta is trying to mitigate the fiscal impact of its infra-structure construction initiative through incremental tax reform. An increase in "sin taxes" that came into effect in September 2017 is slated to cover additional expenditure for the welfare of the elderly. Much other new recurring expendi-ture, such as the extension of free state education for those aged 12-15, designed in part to boost the junta's popularity, has no direct counterbalance on the reve-nue side and will act as a drag on the budget balance in 2018-22. A reformed schedule of property taxes, which will be applied from 2019, will boost revenue later in the forecast period, albeit only modestly, owing to the watering-down of original proposals in order to avoid public objections. Eager to expand the revenue base, the government will try to lift value-added tax (VAT) moderately in the latter part of the forecast period from the current rate of 7%. However, any increase will be gradual; the government will be wary of dampening still relatively slow private consumption growth.

We expect consumer price inflation to remain within the lower bounds of the 1-4% target range set by the Bank of Thailand (BOT, the central bank) throughout the forecast period, giving the monetary authority the policy space to maintain a fairly accommodative stance. Nonetheless, monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US central bank) in 2018-19 and relatively robust economic growth in those two years will incline the BOT to raise the policy rate once in the second half of 2018 and again in 2019. This will be in part to signal to capital markets that there is enough policy room for it to defend the currency and smooth out volatility. Further tightening will be stalled until 2021 owing to still-muted inflation and a cyclical recession in the US-one of Thailand's most important export markets-in 2020. The BOT will resume minor rate increases in 2021-22 as domestic and external economic conditions strengthen.

We expect real GDP to average annual growth of 3.4% in 2018-22. Private consumption will perform better than in recent years, averaging growth of 3% a year in the forecast period (compared with 2% in the historical period). Still-high levels of household debt, which is mostly held by lower-income earners, will continue to act as a dampener on spending. Wage growth will also remain subdued in the forecast period as a whole, although some improvement in the external sector in 2018 will help to lift incomes this year. We expect exports of goods and services to grow by 4.2% a year in 2018-22, compared with 2.6% in 2013-17. Growth in this component will be underpinned throughout 2018-22 by services exports, in the form of tourism, but the volume of goods shipments will improve in the early part of the forecast period. Goods exports will slow amid a recession in the US in 2020.
Total fixed investment will grow by an average of 3.8% in the forecast period. This will be significantly stronger than the 0.9% average annual growth recorded in 2013-17. However, investment growth will be strongest towards the end of the forecast period, as private investors remain cautious in their commitments in the lead-up to and the immediate aftermath of elections that we expect to take place in 2019. Public investment will pick up following numerous delays to projects in recent years and will prop up overall investment growth.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
On the supply side of the economy, we expect the industrial sector to grow the fastest, at an average annual rate of 3.8% in 2018-22. Thailand has been successful in taking the lead in certain industrial sectors relative to its neighbours, such as the automotive industry, in addition to some high-technology subsectors, most notably electronics and machinery components. However, its relative technical capabilities and competitiveness are slowly declining owing to a lack of investment in the sector. This is partly owing to the lack of domestic opportunities-household consumption growth often pales in comparison to Thailand's neighbours. The industrial sector grew by a lacklustre 1.6% in 2017 as domestic demand struggled. Industrial growth will recover in 2018-22 amid increased public investment in infrastructure and a more stable and business-friendly policy environment. Stronger external demand in the early and latter parts of the forecast period will buoy investment sentiment in the largely export-oriented sector. Over the longer term, Thailand risks losing its role as a predominant producer of intermediate manufactured goods to fast-growing countries in the region that have cheaper labour.
The services sector will continue to be dominated by the tourism industry
The services sector will grow by an annual average of 3.3% in 2018-22. Despite a coup in 2014, growth in the sector averaged 4.8% a year in 2013-17 amid surging tourist arrivals from the wider Asian region, especially China. In the forecast period the growth rate will normalise somewhat owing in part to slowing growth in tourist arrivals and related expenditure. Similarly, the retail sector-the largest component of services-will continue to expand at a slower rate over the forecast period. In addition, the financial sector remains relatively healthy. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans has remained fairly stable since 2015 and is far below the levels seen prior to the 2008-09 financial crisis. In addition, banks are well capitalised. Growth in household debt as a percentage of GDP has declined slightly since 2015, although the already-elevated levels of debt here will crimp demand and dampen the expansion of the sector as a whole in 2018-22. The telecommunications segment will see strong growth with the belated development of 4G networks under licences awarded in 2016, and the development of 5G networks towards the end of the forecast period, which will allow firms to meet surging demand for mobile internet services. This will dovetail with the expansion of e-commerce platforms in the country.
The agricultural sector will remain vulnerable to extreme weather cycles, including droughts and floods. Productivity is also likely to suffer as tentative efforts to reform the sector are repeatedly set back by inclement weather events, which will also mean that producers are largely unable to upgrade from current basic technologies. Some subsectors, such as fishing, will struggle early in the forecast period as the industry adapts to the market-access requirements of Western countries regarding labour rights and the government clamps down on unregistered migrant labour. We expect the agricultural sector to grow by an annual average of 2.4% in 2018-22.

We expect consumer prices to increase by an annual average of 1.5% in 2018-22, compared with 0.8% in 2013-17. Firmer commodity prices in 2018 and stronger domestic demand will lead to consumer price inflation accelerating from 0.7% in 2017 to 1.2% in 2018. Inflationary pressures will persist in 2019 but will abate in 2020, when upward pressure on global commodity prices will be impaired by an economic downturn in the US. Thereafter, stronger global economic activity will help to lift average annual inflation to 1.7% in 2021-22.

After strengthening in 2017 and early 2018, the baht is now on a downward trend against the US dollar, which we expect to continue in the remainder of this year. Tax cuts and further interest-rate rises in the US are buoying investor confidence in that market, while fears over the escalation of US-China trade disputes are undermining confidence in emerging markets in Asia. However, the fact that these trends have only come to the fore from mid-2018 means that the value of the local currency will still strengthen against the US dollar in annual average terms compared with 2017. Owing to the continuing strength of the US dollar, the baht will revert to a depreciatory trend in 2019-20 amid more rapidly rising interest rates in the US in 2019 and then an easing of external demand for Thai exports in 2020, owing in part to a cyclical downturn in the US. In these two years we expect the baht to depreciate by an average of 1.7% a year. The latter part of the forecast period will see a restoration of the currency's value as macroeconomic fundamentals strengthen, with the baht appreciating by an annual average of 1% in 2021-22.

The current-account surplus has widened considerably since 2014, driven primarily by growth in tourism-related services and weaker global commodity prices, which have led to lower-cost imports. In 2018-22 the surplus is expected to average the equivalent of 10.4% of GDP, compared with an average of 6.6% of GDP in 2013-17. However, it will struggle to widen further throughout the forecast period, as growth in the trade surplus is tempered by rising global commodity prices and a surge in imports associated with the infrastructure investment drive. A technical recession in the US in 2020 and slowing economic growth in China throughout the forecast period will also play a role in softening Thailand's goods export growth.
The surplus on the services account will continue to rise, driven by the robust tourism sector. However, we expect increasing competition for visitors from the rest of South-east Asia to temper growth in tourist arrivals, compared with the double-digit annual growth rates recorded for much of the last decade. The primary income account will remain in deficit in 2018-22, reflecting the continued repatriation of profits and dividends by foreign-owned firms. However, this will be partly offset by the effect on the secondary income account of personal transfers, notably remittances.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Thailand
Stocks and flows
Net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows (including earnings reinvested by companies already operating in Thailand) were volatile in 2013-17 owing to political uncertainty and a downturn in external demand that dampened confidence in the business environment. From 2016 net FDI flows turned sharply negative, averaging US$11bn in 2016-17, as outbound investment by Thai companies took off while inbound flows still struggled, owing in part to the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, as well as low investor confidence in the Thai economy. In 2017 the stock of inward FDI stood at US$227.8bn, equivalent to 50% of GDP.
Origin and distribution
The privately owned manufacturing sector has traditionally attracted the largest proportion of FDI inflows into Thailand. In particular, manufacturers of automotive parts and producers of electronics and electrical appliances have attracted significant foreign interest in recent years. However, the financial and real-estate sectors have also gained prominence, and in 2017 net FDI flows into each of these two sectors exceeded those that went into manufacturing. Historically, Japanese firms have been the main investors in Thailand. Investment from China has also greatly increased in the past few years. Chinese investors, at least as much as their Japanese counterparts, are likely to gain from Thailand's infrastructure develop-ment plans, but these will essentially come in the form of services contracts in construction and logistics planning.
Determinants
Thailand has traditionally been an attractive investment destination, owing to its relatively competitive labour costs, flexible labour laws and advantageous location within the region. However, some of these advantages have been fading amid sporadic political uncertainty and increasing competition from later-developing regional neighbours. Incentives offered by the Board of Investment (BOI) generally take the form of exemptions from corporate income tax and reduced taxes on imported machinery. The BOI also offers non-tax incentives, including granting permission to bring in foreign workers, own land and take or remit foreign currency abroad. Thailand has generally been regarded as open to foreign investment. Although regulatory uncertainties do exist, the government has actively tried to address these quickly. Indeed, the new large-scale Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) special economic zone includes fast-tracked environmental assessments as an incentive. The EEC fits within the BOI's seven-year investment promotion strategy launched in 2015 that extended incentives to newer industries such as "alternative energy and environmental services" and "hospitality and wellness", while removing existing incentives in certain low-value, labour-intensive industries. The BOI has also been encouraging investment into infrastructure, through a small number of "big-ticket" projects. Although a backlog of proposals accumulated in the period leading up to the 2014 coup, the BOI subsequently expedited the investment application and approval process, and is likely to continue to do so even after the next elections.
Impact
Inflows of FDI have been volatile over the past decade. The ratio of FDI inflows to GDP fell to 1.8% in 2009 owing to the global economic crisis. Following this, FDI inflows fluctuated in 2010-17 amid flood damage and repeated bouts of political uncertainty. Large FDI inflows have helped to support overall economic growth and have contributed to Thailand's development as a leading exporter to other countries in Asia in a number of sectors, including vehicles (particularly light pickup trucks), electronics (especially computer parts) and electrical appliances.
Potential
Following the public approval of the junta-drafted constitution at a referendum in 2016 and the smooth accession of the new king, Thailand's political scene has gained a foothold of political stability. After elections that are scheduled for 2019, challenges to the new political structure and next government are unlikely to materialise before late in the forecast period at the earliest, which bodes well for steadier FDI flows in the forecast period compared with 2013-17. However, a number of other challenges may limit the potential for strong growth in FDI in the next five years. Thailand's attractiveness as a location for investment has been diminishing owing to a rising relative cost base (particularly for labour) and sluggish domestic demand outside the tourism sector. Although the current administration is keen to show a commitment to liberalisation, mainly through the legally binding 20-year National Strategy, access to important sectors such as telecommunications and utilities in the medium term remains in question. Although the standard of infrastructure in the country has improved in recent years, it remains poorer than that in Malaysia, a rival manufacturing location. However, the junta has initiated an ambitious infrastructure development programme to attempt to rectify this shortfall. Although Thailand will continue to attract foreign investment by virtue of its leading position in the development of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free-Trade Area, there is a risk that it may lose out to other countries in the region as they make improvements to their business environments at a faster rate.

Effective family-planning programmes, sex education and changing social norms, such as later marriage and smaller families, will keep Thailand's average population growth rate relatively low, at 0.2% a year, in the forecast period. By 2022 the population is forecast to reach 69.6m, with females accounting for 51.4% of the total. Owing to continued improvements in healthcare and childbirth procedures, the infant mortality rate will drop to an average of 8.6 per 1,000 live births in the forecast period, from 9.6 per 1,000 in 2013-17. Life expectancy will also improve, with men expected to live for an average of 71.9 years in 2018-22, up from 70.8 in 2013-17, while female life expectancy will rise from an average of 78.3 to 79.3 years over the same period.
Thailand's population is ageing, with the proportion of the population aged under 15 set to fall to 15.8% in 2022, from 18.8% in 2011, and the proportion aged over 65 rising steadily. This will mean that the young-age dependency ratio falls to 0.22 in 2022, from 0.26 in 2012, while the old-age dependency ratio rises from 0.13 to 0.2. This demographic trend will place further strains on healthcare provision. The country's health system is structured around a universal healthcare scheme introduced in 2001, which is coming under increasing strains from the growing old-age population. Under the initial programme, the "Bt30 scheme", which was implemented by the government led by Thaksin Shinawatra in 2001, all Thais were entitled to visit a doctor or hospital for a flat fee of Bt30 (around US$1). Following the coup in 2006 that ousted Thaksin, the military-installed government abolished the Bt30 fee, thus making public healthcare free. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects this scheme to remain free in the forecast period.
Road accidents will continue to be a leading cause of death
The crude death rate is forecast at 8.1 per 1,000 in 2018-22. Age-related non-communicable illnesses such as heart disease, stroke and respiratory diseases are responsible for most deaths in Thailand, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). In its latest country profile for Thailand, road accidents were also a leading cause of death, accounting for 5% of total deaths (based on 2012 data). Thailand continues to confront the challenge of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, which in the early 2000s emerged as the country's leading cause of death. Thailand was one of the first countries in Asia to launch a campaign to raise public awareness of HIV/AIDS, and recent figures confirm its effectiveness. The WHO estimates the death rate from the disease at around 23 per 100,000 people in 2016, although 450,000 people continued to live with the disease in that year. Other infectious diseases such as cholera, measles and mumps have become less common but have not been eradicated.
The labour market will tighten owing to the ageing of Thailand's population, and shortages of skilled labour are likely in the next five years. The labour force will expand by an average of 0.3% in 2018-22, to reach 38.7m by 2022, despite a decline in the working-age population. This will be largely owing to increasing numbers of women choosing to work outside the home. Migrant labour will remain abundant, with workers from neighbouring Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos continuing to dominate unskilled jobs in the construction industry and as household employees. However, Thailand will gradually become a less attractive destination for unskilled migrants over the long term. In the near term this will partly reflect a less welcoming stance on the part of the authorities, who are keen to channel unskilled migrant labour into legitimate strategic industries in border-located special economic zones. In the longer term, job opportunities in Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos will expand as those economies grow.
Rural-urban migration is still a significant demographic trend
Despite slow population growth, the number of households in Thailand is expected to rise strongly in the forecast period, mainly as a result of a reduction in average household size. Internal migration and changing social patterns mean that it is increasingly common for households to consist of nuclear, rather than extended, families. Steady economic expansion in recent years has encouraged this trend, as migrant workers from rural areas have been moving to the major cities, and particularly the metropolitan area centred on the capital, Bangkok. Although the former remains the epicentre for the urban population, other cities, including Surat Thani, Chiang Mai and Hat Yai, have also been growing rapidly. This will result in the urban population increasing to 59.8% of the total population in 2022, from 52.9% in 2017.

Thailand constitutes a sizeable market in its own right, with a population of 69m and nominal GDP equivalent to around US$455.5bn at market exchange rates in 2017. Moreover, the development of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free-Trade Area means that firms located in Thailand will continue to enjoy almost entirely duty-free access to ASEAN's population of 500m, including a burgeoning middle class with growing disposable incomes.
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that aggregate personal disposable income will grow at a faster rate in 2018-22 than it did in 2013-17, as economic activity strengthens compared with the historical period on the back of greater policy stability. Although household spending will be tempered by still-high personal debt levels, the very large tourism sector will continue to lend support to the retail sector.
High household debt will undermine disposable incomes in 2018-22
National wealth distribution remains alarmingly disparate between the regions, according to the latest data from the Asian Development Bank. Of the 8.6% of the population defined as living below the nationally defined poverty line (in 2016, living on Bt1568 or less per month), the majority reside in the rural north and north-eastern parts of the country. The capital, Bangkok, remains the wealthiest region by far: personal disposable incomes there are double the national average. Measures to narrow the wealth gap undertaken by govern-ments have tended to be short-term in nature and unsustainable. Therefore, market opportunities in the rural areas remain limited compared with urban centres.
A fairly small proportion of personal disposable income in Thailand is spent on accommodation. However, the share available for spending on consumer goods is tempered by household debt service. In particular, debt burdens among those on lower incomes have a significant negative impact on consumer demand overall and limit the prospects for social mobility among this group. As the level of debt subsides, the release of pent-up demand will boost retail sales towards the end of the forecast period. On average, retail sales volumes will grow by 2.3% a year on average.

Private consumption will grow by an annual average of 3% in 2018-22, faster than the rate of 2% in 2013-17. The next government will maintain policies aimed at supporting consumption through various subsidies and other support packages aimed at helping low-income citizens. There will also be occasional short-term measures to stimulate spending by higher-income groups. Given the still-frail state of private consumption, the value-added tax (VAT) rate is unlikely to be raised from the current level of 7% until later in the forecast period, despite previous discussion on doing so. The government will instead focus on wealth taxes, such as the new inheritance and property taxes, which will avoid burdening lower-income households, although higher "sin taxes" on alcohol and tobacco will still have a minor impact on the population at large.
Free public healthcare will hold down consumer expenditure in that area
Consumer expenditure on essential items, such as food, household goods and clothing, will fall slightly as a proportion of total expenditure as average incomes rise. The average individual outlay on hotels and restaurants is likely to increase as a result of several trends: a rise in the number of women who work (leading to a fall in the number of meals cooked at home); government efforts to promote domestic tourism; and cheaper domestic travel owing to the expansion of budget airlines and rail routes. Expenditure on leisure and education will rise at pace, as higher-income households experience the biggest gains from economic growth in the forecast period. Growth in healthcare spending is forecast to moderate in 2018-22, compared with 2013-17, owing to relatively comprehensive free public healthcare, which we do not expect to be rescinded in the forecast period. The projected increase in spending on transport and communications will largely reflect the expanding market for information technology products, which will be boosted by national upgrades to internet services.

Initial conditions: The past decade has been characterised by political turmoil in Thailand, with two coups in 2006 and 2014 and many (sometimes violent) anti-government protests and rallies. Economic growth has been volatile in the years since the 2008-09 global financial crisis owing to natural disasters and political crises. Although the military-led government that ousted the populist administration of Yingluck Shinawatra in May 2014 has made economic recovery a priority, growth has remained relatively sedate amid political uncertainty. Physical infrastructure remains inadequate in many respects and under increasing strain. Reform of the education system, which is sorely needed, has long been promised, but successive governments have largely failed to modernise the curriculum. As a consequence, the workforce is characterised by a low level of technical skills.
Demographic trends: Thailand's population will age over the long-term forecast period. Slower population growth and longer life expectancies will account for the demographic shift. The female labour force participation rate will be relatively high by 2030, and is expected to rise only modestly from then on. This will lead to an average annual contraction of 1% in the labour force in 2031-50. Nevertheless, a gradual loosening of regulation concerning immigrants' right to work will preclude a steeper fall in the size of the workforce. Successive governments are likely to be forced to ease immigration policies further, owing to the country's negative demographic profile.
External conditions: Thailand faces a challenging external environment in the period to 2050. Although many export-oriented, labour-intensive industries will shift away from China, Thailand will struggle to capitalise on this opportunity owing to a lack of competitiveness compared with lower-cost locations, such as Cambodia, Vietnam and Bangladesh. New regional rivals will also gain ground, including Laos and Myanmar. Closer integration with China could open up market opportunities for Thai businesses in more niche subsectors. One possibility is that Thailand may develop itself as a services centre for China, meeting that country's increasing demand for foreign holidays, regional-specific agricultural goods and other niche products. The government is already spearheading a move in that direction under its "Thailand 4.0" industrial policy and, in part, via its new Eastern Economic Corridor special economic zone. This is particularly the case for the tourism industry, and the ongoing expansion of transport infrastructure will go some way to supporting these aims. Similarly, economic and trade links will be strengthened by the development of overland transport routes between China and Thailand in the next decade or so. The development of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Community, formally established in 2015, will motivate business and technical innovation in Thailand such that it retains its prominence in the region.
Institutions and policy trends: The power struggle between the established military and bureaucratic elites in the capital, Bangkok, who will continue to side with the palace to bolster their legitimacy, and the rural masses that form the majority of the Thai electorate may ease in the decades ahead. However, this will be conditional on successive governments finding a path to restructuring the economy further away from agriculture, not least by moving a far greater proportion of the workforce into industry and services. Democratically elected governments might be successful in instigating such a shift with the introduction of appropriate electoral reforms as well as a focus on medium- to long-term rural development policies, rather than just short-term relief measures.
Long-term performance: The long-term outlook for Thailand's economy is heavily dependent on whether the next government, which will be dominated by the military establishment, is able to sustain the political authority required to initiate appropriate structural reform that will continue into the medium to long term, in addition to upgrading infrastructure. Implementing compre-hensive liberalisation in a number of important sectors, such as power and communications, will help Thailand to regain some of its competiveness relative to its regional neighbours. The effects of an ageing population could be offset by improving educational attainment on the part of the existing workforce or by measures to facilitate greater immigrant access to the labour market. However, progress is likely to be slow in both areas.

Climate change and sustainability
Thailand published a long-term climate change adaptation plan in 2015, the Climate Change Master Plan 2015-2050. It outlines a three-pronged approach divided into mitigation, adaptation and capacity-building targets. The near-term goals included setting emission-reduction targets and establishing incentives for low-carbon emission development. Medium-term targets included reaching at least 25% of energy consumption from renewable sources. Longer-term targets are vaguer, with general goals to increase private investment in green industries and to reduce the carbon intensity of the economy. In line with this plan, Thailand signed and ratified the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) in 2016, committing to specific targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Under COP21, Thailand has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% from the projected business-as-usual forecast by 2030.
The main determinant of emissions levels in Thailand in the coming decades will continue to be energy sourcing. Coal-fired power plants generate close to a fifth of the country's electricity, while lesser-polluting liquefied natural gas facilities account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation. Most of these plants are situated in the south of the country. The government will continue to push for the expansion of renewable energy sources as a share of the country's energy mix and renewable energy is likely to account for around a quarter of total generation capacity by 2040. The commissioning of nuclear power plants in Thailand is also a possibility, which would lower reliance on high-polluting forms. However, the relatively low prices of coal and gas will mean that these will continue to account for the majority of energy generation over the next two decades.
Technological developments
The junta unveiled "Thailand 4.0", a sector-specific industrial policy that aims to attract new investment towards transforming the economy, in May 2016. The name of the strategy describes the intended next stage in the sectoral development of the economy, characterised by the industrial application of state-of-the-art technology. It follows from the current domestic industrial situation that is dominated by heavy industry with advanced machinery, such as in automotive and chemicals production. The Thailand 4.0 strategy focuses on ten strategic industries that are already found in Thailand, but where value can be added via new technologies. These industries include smart electronics, high-income and medical tourism, agriculture and biotechnology, food and beverages, and automotive industries. It will also extend to developing new industries, such as robotics, aerospace, digital services, bioenergy and biochemicals, and healthcare. Incentives for investment in these sectors are likely to be offered for several years and are explicitly targeted towards the introduction of new technology, for example by offering import duty exemption on capital goods for listed industries. Thailand will make some progress in upgrading its industries, but is likely to be constrained by a limited supply of skilled labour.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2013-17) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2018-22). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2013-17. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2018-22 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2013-17 ranges are then used to derive 2018-22 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2018-22, not to the likely situation in 2022 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2015 or 2020). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: India--highlights: Political outlook
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition government, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), to remain in office throughout the forecast period (2018-22). The BJP emerged as the dominant political force after the 2014 parliamentary election, and we expect the NDA to secure re-election at the next ballot in April-May 2019, albeit with a diminished majority. The BJP's electoral strength will also be gradually reflected in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of parliament). We forecast that the BJP and its allies will secure a majority in the Rajya Sabha after 2020, enabling it to pass reform legislation with fewer obstacles. As part of the BJP's foreign policy agenda, India will establish closer strategic ties with Japan and the US, particularly in the light of its growing rivalry with China for influence in South Asia. Relations with Pakistan will remain tense, and although a major conflict is unlikely, minor crossborder military engagements will persist.

The business environment will improve in 2018-22, owing in part to increased political effectiveness and the gradual implementation of reforms that will both open up the economy and boost investment in infrastructure. The rise in India's overall score is driven by higher scores for financing, policy towards private enterprise and competition and foreign exchange and trade controls. Conversely, India fails to make significant progress in the categories of policy towards foreign investment, the labour market and infrastructure, constraining the overall business environment rating.

We forecast that real GDP growth will average 7.6% a year in fiscal years 2018/19-2022/23 (April-March). Private consumption will be a key economic driver as the workforce expands and real wage growth benefits from relatively low consumer price inflation. Government expenditure directed at improving ailing infrastructure will also bolster economic growth, particularly in the first half of the forecast period. We expect gross fixed investment to pick up noticeably in the latter part of the forecast period, supported by government efforts to clean up the bad-debt-ridden banking sector, as well as improvements to the business environment.

India's economy will benefit from a growing population, and the labour force will expand by 1.8% on average in 2018-22. However, fully reaping the benefits of its young population will prove immensely difficult amid a shortage of suitable employment opportunities. Large skills gaps will persist owing to inadequacies in the education system. The tertiary education sector will broadly under-perform, with the exception of a few pockets of excellence. Underemployment and unemployment will add to social tensions. This will be exacerbated by a large gender imbalance. Continued migration into towns and cities from the countryside will also generate economic and social stresses.

Strong GDP growth supports the outlook for wage growth and will assist the expansion of the middle class, even as GDP per head will remain relatively low, at US$2,811 by 2022. Nevertheless, the consumer market will continue to grow, supported by rapidly rising income levels and a huge population of around 1.34bn. The e-commerce sector will expand rapidly on the back of higher smartphone penetration rates and urban demand.

India will become the world's third-largest economy by 2050 on the back of strong growth, supported by a shift in employment from rural to urban areas. However, a divergence in economic fortunes at individual and state levels will lead to social and political tensions. We forecast that India will account for 13% of world GDP by 2050 (at market exchange rates), up from just 3.4% in 2017. India's growing economic might will enable it to become an increasingly influential global diplomatic force. Owing to shared strategic geopolitical and economic interests, India will move closer to the US and Japan. The continuing rivalry for influence in South Asia will weigh on Sino-Indian ties.

a Actual. b Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: India gained independence in 1947 after two centuries of British colonial rule. Partition at the same time created the state of Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars-two over the disputed territory of Kashmir. India is the second most populous country in the world, with an estimated 1.34bn people in 2017, according to the UN. Its economy is the sixth largest in the world when measured in nominal US dollars, but the third largest at purchasing power parity exchange rates.
Political structure: India has been a democracy since independence. At federal level, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) holds a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), although it governs in a broader coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). India follows the Westminster model of parliamentary government, with a prime minister as head of government, and a president as the head of state. The country has a quasi-federal structure, with state governments having their own legislatures and enjoying a fair degree of freedom.
Policy issues: Progress on reform is constrained by a lack of consensus across the political spectrum over the nature and scope of economic reforms. The NDA administration has made headway in speeding up infrastructure projects and undertaking piecemeal liberalisation of outdated regulations, but broader reform is hindered by the NDA's lack of a majority in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house). The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the NDA to obtain a majority in the upper house after 2020, which will make it easier to push legislation through parliament.
Taxation: The government will continue to make efforts to broaden the tax base in 2018-22, including by further digitising tax departments. This, coupled with strong economic growth, will support a pick-up in tax collection. Despite some reforms, including the introduction of a nationwide goods and services tax (GST) in 2017, India's tax system will remain highly complex.
Foreign trade: India's trade deficit widened to US$148.1bn in 2017, from US$107.5bn in 2016, while its surplus on the services account rose from US$65.9bn to US$75.9bn over the period.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
India's constitution came into effect in 1950, underpinning the country's democratic system of governance. The state is secular, giving no preference to any of the manifold religious or social groups. India's democracy is well entrenched and free and fair elections for the national and state parliaments have been held for decades. The country's two major political parties include the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the dominant component party of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and the Indian National Congress, which governed the country for decades, often in coalition with smaller regional parties. These regional parties often dominate state assemblies, enabling them to wield significant influence on national politics through the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of parliament). The BJP holds a slim majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house) and governs with the support of smaller parties in the NDA. The NDA government has been in office since May 2014, and will face another general election in April-May 2019. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects it to secure re-election, albeit with a diminished majority.
The BJP's ideological approach is towards the more conservative bent of the political spectrum. It has historically mixed a pro-urban middle class economic agenda with social conservatism and a more aggressive foreign and security policy. In recent years, however, the party has become more populist; it has adopted more rural-focused policies in an attempt to broaden its appeal. Congress has a more centre-left ideological approach to socio-economic issues.

Political outlook: Political stability
We expect the NDA to remain in a strong position politically in 2018-22. The NDA has been in office since 2014 and is dominated by the centre-right BJP. NDA constituent parties control 20 of the country's 29 states, including some of the largest, such as Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, is proving to be the country's most dominant political leader in decades, and we expect him to remain in a strong position to pursue his political and economic agenda after the 2019 election for the Lok Sabha.
The NDA's dominance in parliament will increase after 2020, when we expect the alliance to take control of the Rajya Sabha. Lawmakers in the upper house are elected by members of state assemblies. However, changes in the composition of state assemblies have a delayed impact on parties' strength in the Rajya Sabha, as a third of the upper-house members are elected every two years on a rotating basis. Once the NDA assumes control of the Rajya Sabha, it will be able to pass legislation without the consent of opposition parties.
Nonetheless, the BJP's tightening grip on power has resulted in a backlash from other political parties. In July 2018 opposition parties brought a no-confidence motion against the government in the Lok Sabha. Given that the BJP and its allies enjoy a majority in the lower house, the no-confidence motion failed to pass. Another such motion before the 2019 election is unlikely, with opposition parties now focused on election campaigning.
Over the forecast period political stability could be compromised by rising sectarian tensions stoked by far-right affiliates of the BJP. These groups have long been pushing for India to be recast as a Hindu state-a view that puts them at odds with minority groups, particularly Muslims. Economic distress in the agricultural sector resulting from weak monsoons could also lead to volatility in rural areas. However, given the electoral influence of farmers, both central and state governments will be quick to mollify any large protests by providing subsidies and sops, including waiving bad loans.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
The outlook for political and institutional effectiveness in 2018-22 is mixed. The BJP dominates the political landscape at national and, increasingly, state level. The party has full control of the lower house and has been gradually able to expand its presence in the Rajya Sabha. In August 2017 it became the largest party in the upper house, surpassing Congress for the first time. However, the BJP's growing dominance on the political scene has resulted in a backlash from opposition parties, as well as some of its NDA allies. This will serve to constrain the government's effectiveness as opposition parties co-operate to counter the BJP. Moreover, the BJP's right-wing affiliates are often at odds with the party's governance agenda, including on issues such as labour law reform and simplification of land-acquisition laws. Furthermore, some right-wing Hindu organisations, such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, have increased the pressure on the BJP to pursue a more religious-oriented, conservative governance agenda, impairing government effectiveness by diverting attention away from reform issues. We expect the BJP to secure re-election in 2019, which bodes well for policy continuity and government effectiveness. Moreover, currently the NDA lacks a majority in the Rajya Sabha, which hinders the legislative process. We believe that the NDA will secure a majority in the upper house after 2020, and it will then be able to pass legislation without approval from the opposition. This will ease the passage of laws in parliament.
In the medium to long term the BJP government's focus on so-called competitive federalism, which encourages competition among India's states, will lead to a notable improvement in political and institutional effectiveness in reform-oriented states, particularly in the south and the west. However, as the gap between richer and poorer states widens, disruption at national level could emerge. Some of the populous poorer states, including Uttar Pradesh, are important political battlegrounds that no national government can afford to neglect. There is a risk that, owing to economic disparities, poorer states will flex their political muscle to force a redistribution of fiscal resources. However, the risk of this occurring is relatively benign in the forecast period, as any such changes could trigger a backlash in the relatively prosperous southern and western states, which the government will be keen to avoid.
Political outlook: Election watch
The NDA is expected to win another term in office in the parliamentary election scheduled for early 2019, albeit with a reduced majority. Recent by-elections have brought mixed results for the ruling alliance, indicating some anti-incumbency sentiment, which will adversely affect the NDA's margin of victory in the 2019 national election.
Meanwhile, opposition parties are boosting collaboration ahead of the election in a bid to check the NDA's electoral dominance, and are attacking the government on issues such as rising agrarian distress, persistent unemployment challenges and mounting social and communal tensions. It is highly likely that several regional opposition parties and the de facto national-level opposition party, Congress, will enter into an understanding ahead of the lower-house poll. Collaboration is being led by strong regional leaders who enjoy significant popularity in their respective states, such as Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal. It is likely that an opposition alliance will coalesce around a popular regional figure like Ms Banerjee, rather than around the president of Congress, Rahul Gandhi, who has struggled to counter the popularity of Mr Modi. Any such alliance will make gains in the upcoming election, particularly as even small vote swings can alter results in India's first-past-the-post electoral system. However, the opposition alliance's overall electoral success will be constrained by ideological contrasts and rivalries between the leaders of its constituent parties.
In November 2018 four states will hold elections to their assemblies. Three are controlled by the BJP and are crucial to its electoral plan for 2019. We expect the BJP to secure another term in office in two of these states-Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Rajasthan is likely to see a very close fight, possibly ending in a hung assembly. Unexpected electoral setbacks for the BJP in these polls would heighten the risks to the NDA's chances in the 2019 national election.
Political outlook: International relations
India will continue to push for a closer relationship with the US in 2018-22, partly to counter China's growing influence in South Asia. To this effect, India has upped security co-operation with the US in recent years. Nevertheless, although India-US ties will remain warm in 2018-22, trade disputes will linger, as a protectionist trade agenda is being pushed by the US under Donald Trump's presidency. In recent weeks these trade tensions have flared, with tariffs being imposed from both sides. Although the current tensions are unlikely to escalate into a serious deterioration of relations, and we expect negotiations to ease the situation to some extent, some disputes will persist throughout 2018-22 and slow down the expansion of US-India bilateral trade.
After a period of tensions with China, in recent months Mr Modi has moved to improve ties with the country. However, China's growing presence in South Asia, particularly its close relationship with Pakistan, will continue to irk India. Moreover, long-standing border disputes between China and India will fester in the next five years. Consequently, Sino-India ties will remain fairly brittle in 2018-22. Meanwhile, India will also continue to seek closer ties with other countries with significant economic or military heft, such as Japan and Russia, in an attempt to buttress its international standing in the face of a rising China.
Border disputes with Pakistan will linger in 2018-22. A major conflict is unlikely, but minor crossborder military engagements will persist. The NDA government will continue to deepen ties with countries in the Middle East, particularly Israel, which is an increasingly important source of arms for India.

India's overall score in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings rises to 5.68 in 2018-22, from 5.18 in 2013-17. However, its global ranking remains unchanged at 62nd out of 82 countries, owing to greater improvements elsewhere. Among its BRICS peers, India scores better than Russia (5.37), but fares worse than Brazil (6.08), China (6.07) and South Africa (6.03). India's score is dragged down by weak ratings for infrastructure, the labour market and taxes. Despite improvements in these scores in 2018-22, they will remain the worst-rated areas of the business environment. This supports our view that in 2018-22 political exigencies and a lack of a government majority in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of parliament) until after 2020 will limit progress with reforms.
India's relatively smooth changes in government and mild risk of social unrest and armed conflict lend support to its comparatively strong score for political stability. However, the limited ability of the state machinery to meet the needs of a fast-growing and diverse economy, as well as high levels of corruption, limit its score for political effectiveness. Meanwhile, the score for foreign trade and exchange controls improves markedly in the forecast period, supported by higher scores for the categories of trade protectionism, capital-account controls and advances in the ease of doing trade.

Business environment outlook: India's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: States such as Gujarat and Haryana continue to make headway in liberalising the investment regime. Meanwhile, the new goods and services tax (GST) regime spurs the creation of more inter-state supply chains by reducing tax checks between states, which have previously delayed the movement of goods.
2020-22: After the 2019 parliamentary election the central government undertakes piecemeal privatisation of some state-run companies, but fails to meet its disinvestment targets.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Foreign participation in key sectors, including manufacturing of defence equipment, picks up pace.
2020-22: Full ownership of multi-brand retail companies remains off limits for foreign investors. However, single-brand retail sees continued foreign investment.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Trade tensions with the US rise as both sides adopt an increasingly protectionist stance. There is no progress on the proposed free-trade agreement with the EU.
2020-22: The vast majority of restrictions on the free movement of capital remain in place.
Taxes
2018-19: Tax reforms lose momentum as the government's priority shifts to appeasing voters ahead of the 2019 election.
2020-22: The widening tax base and improved compliance allow for cuts to corporate tax rates.
Financing
2018-19: Higher bad-loan provisioning weighs on the profitability of the banking sector. Meanwhile, tighter regulation leads to an increase in the sector's non-performing loan ratio, as more cases of poor lending are detected.
2020-22: The share of private-sector banks in total lending continues to rise, as most public-sector banks struggle with a large volume of bad debts.
The labour market
2018-19: Reforms to labour laws move at a glacial pace due to obstruction by trade unions and opposition groups.
2020-22: Efforts to improve labour laws gather pace after the National Democratic Alliance government obtains a majority in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of parliament) after 2020, easing the passage of reform legislation.
Infrastructure
2018-19: The government increases its budgetary allocation for infrastructure projects, such as the Bharatmala road connectivity scheme.
2020-22: Construction of a high-speed rail link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad continues, but the project misses its completion target of August 2022.
Technological readiness
2018-19: Most technological innovation continues to be concentrated in a few clusters, such as Bangalore.
2020-22: Despite persistent efforts, the speed and reliability of internet connectivity remain poor by global standards.

India's score for macroeconomic environment improves marginally, from 6.6 in 2013-17 to 6.9 in 2018-22, and the country jumps two places in both the global and regional rankings. The economy will record robust expansion throughout the forecast period, outstripping growth in its counterparts in the BRICS grouping-Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa.
Twin deficits on the fiscal and current accounts will remain one of the weakest aspects of India's macroeconomic environment. The rising value of energy imports-led by higher crude oil prices, as well as increases in imports of gold, consumer electronics, machinery and equipment to cater to fast-growing consumer and industrial demand-will also add to the import bill. Fiscal pressures will continue despite rising tax collection as the government outspends its receipts to fund burgeoning development projects. Nevertheless, some fiscal consolidation measures will be undertaken from 2019 onwards, helping the government to narrow the budget deficit to the equivalent of 2.9% of GDP in fiscal year 2022/23 (April-March), from 3.5% in 2017/18.
Meanwhile, persistent efforts by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) to counter inflation will yield results, and consumer price rises will remain within the RBI's target band of 2-6% throughout the forecast period.
Business environment outlook: Policy towards private enterprise and competition

The score for policy towards private enterprise and competition improves to 5.3 in 2018-22, from 4.5 in 2013-17, mainly owing to a reduction in price controls and deregulation. However, India's global and regional rankings remain unchanged.
The government has made progress on streamlining the bureaucracy and merging some ministries, easing the approval process for industrial and infrastructure projects. It has also encouraged competition among states by devolving power to them to experiment locally with pro-business liberalisation. The pioneers in this process have been the southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, as well as the western state of Gujarat and the northern state of Haryana. Haryana, for example, has consolidated the granting of over 70 business approvals within one agency, the Enterprise Promotion Centre, making it easier for businesses to obtain clearances. Despite these state-level measures, however, the scope for improvement remains immense.
The government's privatisation plan will be only partially successful
Buoyed by its success in exceeding its disinvestment target of Rs725bn (US$10.8bn) for 2017/18, the government raised its target for 2018/19 to Rs800bn. However, the lukewarm response to the administration's disinvestment plans so far, such as its failed bid to divest in the flag carrier, Air India, indicate that this push is unlikely to be sustained and that the authorities will fail to meet the target in the forecast period.
The retail and wholesale distribution system remains considerably fragmented, with limited investment. The introduction of a nationwide goods and services tax (GST) in 2017, which replaced a slew of state-wide taxes, is improving the efficiency of supply chains. However, the overall distribution system will remain constrained by poor infrastructure. This will continue to create significant challenges for domestic and foreign firms. Moreover, 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail is unlikely to be permitted in the forecast period, owing to opposition from small businesses, which form a crucial vote bank for the Bharatiya Janata Party (the main component party of the governing coalition).

India's score for policy towards foreign investment is unchanged at 5.5 in 2018-22. However, its global ranking drops from 62nd to 66th as its regional peers make headway in their efforts to attract foreign investors. Nonetheless, India will continue to receive higher FDI inflows in the forecast period as the government makes efforts to ease red tape. As a result, FDI inflows will grow rapidly in the next five years, rising to US$81bn by 2022, more than doubling from US$40bn in 2017. However, the volume of inward FDI in 2022 will still be lower than that of China, which will attract FDI inflows of US$155bn in the same year.
In July 2018 Samsung Electronics of South Korea opened a factory to manufacture mobile phones in Noida, India. Samsung has said that this is the world's largest factory for mobile-phone manufacturing, and the government has claimed it as a success story of its "Make in India" promotional campaign. Nevertheless, this factory remains an exception, and the overall manufacturing sector will fail to gather significant momentum in 2018-22, owing to-among other factors-challenges of land acquisition.
Policy changes will encourage foreign investment in the automotive sector
Foreign investment in the automotive sector will remain strong in the forecast period, owing to fast growth in household incomes, which will boost demand for cars. To this end, a Japanese car manufacturer, Suzuki (the largest car maker in India by volume, holding close to 50% of the market), is investing US$1bn jointly with another Japanese company, Toyota, to maintain its hold over what is a rapidly growing market. Volkswagen of Germany is also formulating a strategy to expand its currently small presence in India. Tougher environmental standards from 2020 will support car sales as older models that do not meet these regulations are phased out. Furthermore, state governments are devising policies to support the fledging electric-vehicle (EV) industry. For example, some states, such as Gujarat and Maharashtra, are procuring EVs for their own government fleets. This will support car manufacturers, the majority of which are foreign-owned.
In July 2018 the government announced a draft e-commerce policy. It proposes the creation of a new e-commerce regulator to, among other things, enforce compliance of foreign-based e-commerce firms with foreign-investment caps in India's e-commerce sector, and enforce stricter controls on mergers and acquisitions in the sector. However, the policy is unlikely to be approved in its current form, owing to opposition from industry groups.
Business environment outlook: Foreign trade and exchange controls

The score for foreign trade and exchange controls improves significantly to 6.4 in the forecast period, from 5.1 in 2013-17. As a result, the country's global ranking rises from 70th to 62nd, and its regional position improves from 16th to 13th. This progress is due to trade liberalisation and modest deregulation of capital-account restrictions. In addition, some headway will be made on reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers in 2018-22. Under its revised foreign trade policy, the government has lowered an array of export subsidies and harmonised them under two general schemes, one for goods and one for services. This is part of a broader effort to stimulate exports through supply-side reforms meant to boost the competitiveness of Indian exporters.
Most restrictions on the free movement of capital will stay in place in 2018-22
Rules governing outward investment and overseas borrowing will continue to be liberalised in 2018-22, but regulatory restrictions on the free movement of capital will largely remain in place. The authorities have significantly liberalised capital-account regulations in recent years. In 2015 the central bank permitted companies to raise local-currency-denominated debt abroad for the first time (although it still mandates that all transactions be settled in US dollars). Legislative restrictions for non-residents apply only to inflows. Despite moves by the RBI to make capital-account transactions easier, we do not expect the government to introduce full capital-account convertibility in 2018-22.
Negotiations between India and the EU on a proposed free-trade agreement have been stalled since 2013 owing to disagreement on a few contentious issues, and the deal is unlikely to be revived in the forecast period. India has a patchy record on trade liberalisation, and the government has often resorted to protectionism in the face of threats to domestic industry from foreign competitors.
India will remain fairly protectionist
In July 2018 the Directorate-General of Trade Remedies (an agency under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry) recommended tariffs for two years (until 2020) on solar panel imports from China and Malaysia, in a bid to safeguard India's domestic manufacturers. Although these measures are still under discussion, India's approach to trade will remain relatively protectionist in 2018-22. Indeed, the country's export subsidies are one of the factors that has led to a flare-up of trade tensions with the US; these subsidies are unlikely to be watered down significantly in 2018-22.

India's score for taxes rises marginally to 5.2 in 2018-22, from 5 in 2013-17. As a result, the country's global and regional rankings improve marginally. However, the country's scores for subcategories within taxes remain largely unchanged, reflecting the slow pace of progress.
The nationwide GST introduced in July 2017 marks one of India's biggest tax reforms in decades. It replaced a slew of central and state indirect taxes and is a significant step towards creating a single market. Since its roll-out, the GST Council has met regularly and taken measures to simplify the GST, and cut its rates. (The GST Council comprises a group of ministers authorised with deciding changes to the rate and structure of the tax.) As GST collections pick up, the government will continue to rationalise GST rates and bring more items into lower tax brackets, although multiple tax slabs will remain in place. Furthermore, several key items, including alcoholic spirits and petroleum products, will remain outside the GST net.
Foreign investors will remain wary of the government's opaque tax regime, highlighted by the risk of retrospective changes to tax laws. Public concerns over tax evasion have led to the government increasing the regulatory power of tax authorities, raising concerns of overreach in a country where tax laws remain complex.
Corporate tax rates will fall gradually over the forecast period
The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government has previously declared its intention of reducing corporate tax rates in a phased manner. In the budget for 2018/19, the 25% corporate tax rate applicable for businesses with turnover of up to Rs500m (US$7.5m) was extended to firms with turnover of up to Rs2.5bn. Meanwhile, efforts to widen the tax base by increasing the capacity of tax authorities and identifying non-compliers will continue. A gradual relaxation in tax rates will continue throughout the forecast period, as strong economic growth and a widening tax base will enable the government to reduce corporate tax rates without forgoing substantial amounts of revenue.
Business environment outlook: Financing

The score for financing improves from 5.1 in 2013-17 to 5.9 in 2018-22. However, India's position in the global rankings deteriorates from 57th to 58th as other countries make greater progress in this area. Nevertheless, financial regulation in India will improve throughout the forecast period, underpinned by concerns over the large volume of bad loans. In its biannual Financial Stability Report published in June 2018, the RBI indicated that it expects the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio of the banking sector to rise to 12.2% by March 2019, from 11.6% in March 2018. Nevertheless, improved bad-loan provisioning and strict regulation will support an improvement in the sector's health towards the latter part of our forecast period. The disclosure of a US$1.7bn bank fraud in January indicates that the NPL problem may go deeper than previously anticipated. Consequently, this is leading to stricter surveillance, which will result in further fraud disclosures. This will weigh on the banking sector's profitability in the coming quarters. However, in the latter half of the forecast period this should support a mild recovery in the sector. Meanwhile, the RBI's primary policy priority will remain inflation-targeting, and the central bank will carefully calibrate policy to avoid episodes of rapid inflation, such as the 10.1% average increase in consumer prices in 2013. By contrast, we expect consumer prices to rise by 4.8% a year on average in 2018-22.
The share of private banks in total lending will rise in 2018-22
Private and foreign companies will take on a rising share of financing, particularly as the bulk of NPLs continue to emanate from public-sector banks. However, state-run lenders will still account for the bulk of total lending given the vast network of the public sector, especially in rural areas. There will be divergence in the performance of state run banks, with the largest public-sector lender (also the overall largest bank), the State Bank of India, performing better than smaller state-run lenders owing to its much larger bad-loan provisioning and significant improvements to its corporate governance standards.
The RBI has indicated that it will stick to its March 2019 deadline for rolling out Basel III norms. Several public-sector banks are currently under the prompt corrective action framework (an RBI operational framework for banks that fail to meet minimum capital-adequacy and NPL requirements). Under the central bank's baseline projections, as many as six state-run lenders will miss the minimum capital-adequacy requirements by the March 2019 deadline. Thus, there may be consolidation or restructuring (including mergers) of some public-sector banks as the government attempts to revive these ailing institutions. However, outright privatisation remains very unlikely, given political pressure from trade unions and opposition parties.
Priority-sector lending targets will remain in place
Priority-sector lending (minimum mandated lending to specific sectors aimed at achieving socio-developmental objectives) will remain a feature of government policy throughout the forecast period. The RBI will continue to push both state-owned and private banks to meet priority-sector targets. Indian commercial banks and foreign lenders with more than 20 branches in India are currently required to provide 40% of their net bank credit to the priority sectors, which include agriculture, housing and renewable energy. A significant reduction in this target is unlikely in 2018-22.

India's score for the labour market improves from 4.7 in 2013-17 to 5.1 in 2018-22. However, the country slips to the bottom of our regional rankings, as other regional economies make greater progress on improving labour market conditions. India has taken some limited steps towards overhauling its outdated array of labour laws (many of which have not be comprehensively revamped in decades) under the current administration. However, in 2018-22 progress will be inhibited by opposition from trade unions (including those affiliated with the ruling coalition). This does not mean that no reform will take place-indeed, there has been progress on revamping labour regulations. For example, in March 2018 the government announced that it was seeking to allow all industrial establishments to hire workers on fixed-term contracts, previously permissible only for the textile industry. However, changes to more trouble-some pieces of legislation, such as the Industrial Disputes Act, remain unlikely. A major reason for the slow progress on reforming labour laws is the government's lack of a majority in the Rajya Sabha, which means that it depends on the support of opposition parties to get legislation approved. We expect the NDA to obtain a majority in the upper house after 2020, which should speed up the legislation process.
Efforts to revamp labour laws will meet political resistance
In July 2018 the government announced that it had prepared a Code of Industrial Relations, representing the consolidation of over 40 different labour laws under four major codes covering wages, industrial relations, social security, and occupational safety, health and working conditions. Given strong resistance from opposition parties and trade unions, passage of this bill will not be swift. We do not expect the bill to be passed in the current session of parliament, or in the upcoming winter session. It is more likely that the code will be taken up in the Lok Sabha (the lower house) after the April-May 2019 election, where it could be subject to significant criticism and modifications owing to concerns raised by trade unions over the withdrawal of some protective provisions.
Some state governments, particularly in the west and south, will continue to implement labour reforms throughout the forecast period. Rajasthan has, for example, exempted establishments with up to 300 workers from the provision of the Industrial Disputes Act which requires government permission before laying off workers. Meanwhile, Maharashtra has set self-certification systems for business units covered under 16 different acts, with a view to reducing the interference of government officials as well as expediting the process of certification. However, without changes at central level, harmonisation of these reforms across states will remain a challenge throughout the forecast period.

Significant gaps between demand supply in infrastructure will persist
The score for infrastructure improves from 3 in 2013-17 to 3.5 in 2018-22. This is driven by higher scores for road density, distribution networks and air transport. However, India remains a laggard in this category, ranked 78th out of the 82 countries, driven by weak scores for internet speed, rail density and ports. Infrastructure improvements and expansion remain key priorities for the NDA government. We expect the bulk of public investment to be diverted to transport, energy and urban-improvement projects. However, the pace of progress on projects that are already under way will remain constrained by weak government effectiveness and delays in regulatory clearances (particularly environmental approvals).
Progress on urban civic infrastructure projects, such as water supply, will be hindered by inadequate private-sector involvement given the limited returns on investment in these sectors. The private sector will instead be focused on areas that promise faster returns, like airport construction, and there will be significant progress in these areas in 2018-22. However, demand for infra-structure facilities will continue to exceed supply by a significant margin in the forecast period, placing stress on already scarce resources.
Flagship infrastructure projects are likely to miss completion targets
Two publicly funded connectivity projects, Bharatmala (road construction) and Sagarmala (port construction), will continue to be prioritised throughout the forecast period. The first phase of Bharatmala is aimed at connecting 550 of the country's districts through the national highways network, compared with only 300 connected as at 2017. The government plans to build a total of 24,800 km of roads by 2022. However, progress on this project will be hindered by limited funds, and it is likely to miss its targets.
The quality and breadth of railway services will remain a challenge in 2018-22. India has one of the largest rail networks in the world, but the quality of the network is inadequate, with accidents and poor speeds that restrain efficiency. A lack of capital investment in the sector constrains the expansion of capacity. Despite piecemeal efforts, the overall quality of the rail network will remain poor when compared with other countries with large rail networks, such as China and the US. However, rapid transit projects, including a bullet train connecting Ahmedabad to Mumbai, and several ongoing urban mass rapid transit projects, will make significant progress during the forecast period.
Government efforts to facilitate online filing for new start-ups, online payment for public services and other citizen engagement programmes, as part of an e-governance scheme, have had limited success so far. With participation from private players, the authorities will continue to promote online transactions as it continues to prioritise the digitisation of public services, although the pace of execution will be tempered by implementation challenges. For example, integration of the Aadhaar (a unique digitised identity card) platform with government transfers and subsidy payments will continue in the forecast period. Tax services are likely to be linked to the Aadhaar scheme in the next few years.

This section, introduced as part of an upgrade to our business environment rankings in 2018, aims to show how future-oriented the business environment is-the extent to which it is digitally connected, open to innovation and prepared for technological disruption. Aided by a cheap smartphone boom, India scores relatively high on technological readiness. However, despite the improvement in its-from 6.1 in 2013-17 to 6.3 in 2018-22-the country's global ranking drops one place to 42nd. This is mainly owing to weak scores for patent filings and cyber-security preparedness. Indeed, limited investment in research and development will continue to hamper a pick-up in the number of patents approved in 2018-22.
Internet speeds will remain slow by global standards
Despite achieving significant mobile-phone penetration, India lags behind in terms of mobile internet speeds. For example, India's 4G internet speeds fall well short of the global average according to a market intelligence company, OpenSignal. In June 2018 the Telecom Commission, a government agency, approved the new National Digital Communication Policy, the objectives of which include providing minimum download speeds of 50 mbps and enabling 10-gbps connectivity to all rural administrations by 2022. With an estimated investment of US$100bn, this ambitious policy aims to generate 4m jobs in digital communication and increase the sector's contribution to India's GDP from around 6% currently to 8% by 2022. However, acquiring spectrum licences and laying the requisite fibre network will create obstacles, and the government is likely to fall short of its targets.
E-commerce has become the focal point of India's digital revolution, owing to factors such as FDI-friendly regulation, a growing middle class, the availability of relatively cheap mobile connections and skilled labour to develop indigenous technology platforms. According to the government's India Brand Equity Foundation, the e-commerce market will grow from US$38.5bn in 2017 to US$200bn by 2026. Meanwhile, a report published in February 2018 from US-based Boston Consulting Group and Google says that total online consumer spending will rise from US$40bn currently to US$100bn by 2020, led by spending on e-commerce, travel and hotels, financial services and digital media. According to estimates from a local research firm, RedSeer, an e-commerce retailer, Flipkart, accounts for 46% of India's online sales, in close competition with the local operation of Amazon (US) at 30%. The e-commerce segment will continue to grow at a robust pace in 2018-22.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
As the 2019 general election approaches, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government will shift gears from improving the business environment to a more populist agenda, in a bid to garner support from voters. This move will include efforts to improve both the design and the effectiveness of welfare programmes, as well as expanding the reach of these schemes. The government has been linking welfare transfers to bank accounts through the Aadhaar unique identity platform. In 2018-22 this platform is also likely to be linked to business transactions and tax payments, in an effort to bring greater transparency to tax administration and business procedures. The Economist Intelligence Unit also expects the government to focus on improving the quality of infrastructure. However, high levels of corruption and limited government effectiveness in implementing public works will constrain progress.
We expect the government's focus to return to less popular economic reforms after the 2019 election. These will entail greater fiscal consolidation, as well as relaxing restrictions on foreign direct investment, streamlining tax laws and simplifying regulations on doing business. The government has implemented some piecemeal labour reforms, such as allowing industrial establishments to hire workers on fixed contracts. However, more significant changes to problematic labour laws such as the Industrial Disputes Act are unlikely because of strong opposition from trade unions. Similarly, a substantial relaxation of land-acquisition laws is also unlikely in 2018-22, owing to strong opposition from farmers. More broadly, the government will continue to prioritise its electoral appeal among voters during the forecast period, and is unlikely to push for reforms that are highly politically contentious.
We expect significant economic reforms to take place at state level. However, the extent of these reforms will be uneven, with some states, such as Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu (traditionally considered more business-friendly), continuing to adopt noteworthy reforms while other states lag behind.

Government debt 49.8 49.2 47.7 46.2 45.1 43.9
Tax reform is one of the NDA's key policy agendas, and efforts towards greater formalisation of the economy and broadening of the tax base will gather pace in fiscal years 2018/19-2022/23 (April-March). However, given the complexities in India's tax system, as well as high levels of corruption, these efforts are likely to yield mixed results. This is evident from the difficulties faced by the govern-ment and businesses in rolling out the goods and services tax (GST) that was introduced in 2017. Nevertheless, strong economic growth will support healthy progress in both direct and indirect tax collection, bolstering the public finances.
The government will increase spending on the upgrade of India's infrastructure in the next five years, as well as on subsidies and welfare payments to boost support from voters in 2018-19. As a result, it will record a persistent fiscal deficit, averaging the equivalent of 3.2% of GDP in 2018/19-2022/23. In 2018/19 an expansionary budget will preclude any reduction in the fiscal deficit, which will reach 3.6% of GDP. However, the government will revert to a path of modest fiscal consolidation after the 2019 election, and the fiscal deficit will narrow gradually to 2.9% of GDP by 2022/23.
This improving picture masks the large deficits being recorded by several state governments, which are not included in the national figure. The deep fiscal deficits of some states, such as Punjab, will pose downside risks to GDP growth by potentially crowding out private investment.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) will continue to make inflation-targeting the cornerstone of its monetary policy framework in the next five years. The RBI will aim to contain consumer price inflation within the 2-6% range and close to its optimum target of 4% throughout the forecast period. In order to arrest rising inflationary pressures, the RBI tightened its monetary policy stance at its meeting in June 2018, raising its benchmark policy rate, the repurchase (repo) rate, by 25 basis points. We expect another 25-basis-point increase in the repo rate in the third quarter of this year in order to calm inflation expectations. Following this, the RBI will maintain a neutral stance in 2019, before adopting a more accommodative stance in 2020 in order to offset the disinflationary impact of a downturn in the US economy in that year. The easing cycle will be completed by 2021, and the RBI will revert to a tightening stance in 2021-22, as growth in domestic demand accelerates.
Rising instances of bank fraud and a lack of transparency in the regulatory oversight of state-run banks will lead to disputes between the Ministry of Finance and the RBI over the regulatory role of the central bank. Nevertheless, the RBI will continue to enjoy a high degree of independence in setting the monetary policy agenda.

We forecast that real GDP growth will average 7.6% a year in 2018/19-2022/23. Expansion will be supported by robust increases in private consumption, averaging 7.8% annually in the next five years and making the largest contri-bution to headline growth. In addition, the economy will receive support from accelerating gross fixed investment, which will grow by an average of 8.8% a year in 2018/19-2022/23. This will be underpinned by progress in recapitalising the banking sector, although a lack of broader reforms in the sector will continue to place constraints on lending activity. Other efforts aimed at improving the business environment, such as tax reforms and the increased digitisation of government-to-business services, will also enhance investor sentiment. Public spending ahead of parliamentary and state elections will be a key source of support in the early part of the forecast period, with government consumption growing by 10.4% a year on average in 2018/19-2019/20. However, government spending will moderate over the latter half of the forecast period.
In factor-cost terms, real GDP will be driven by growth in the services sector, which will average 9.2% a year over the forecast period. The sector will make the largest contribution to headline growth, accounting for nearly 50% of nominal GDP by the end of the forecast period. Meanwhile, industry will benefit from the improving business environment and healthy investment, with output growing by 8.5% a year in 2018/19-2022/23. The agricultural sector will remain hostage to the vagaries of the monsoon. Its sluggishness will continue to dampen potential income growth in rural areas.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
As the economy moves up the value chain and productivity across the economy improves, the share of agriculture in total output will continue to gradually decline; we expect it to fall from 17.1% in 2017/18 to 14.2% by 2022/23. However, the primary sector will remain crucial, as it employs close to half of the population. As employment opportunities in the secondary and tertiary sector open up, there will, however, be a gradual shift in employment away from agriculture. Reforms to bolster supply-chain efficiency will support the sector's outlook in 2018-22. However, farm to wholesale procurement is still dominated by individual middlemen and local traders, with laws inhibiting the entry of companies in many states. This will continue to create inefficiencies in the procurement process. Nevertheless, public investment in improving agricultural logistics will support farm incomes. There is significant scope for investment to enhance the sector's productivity, as close to half of cultivable land remains dependent on annual monsoon rainfalls, rendering the sector vulnerable to poor or unevenly distributed rains. The government has recognised the sector's vulnerability to monsoon rainfalls and increased funding for irrigation schemes and crop insurance. As agriculture faces growing risks related to the availability of water, the success of these efforts will prove crucial to ensuring long-term sustainability. However, capital investment into the sector remains inadequate, and the bulk of public funding will continue to come in the form of populist short-term subsidies aimed at securing political support from farmers. We forecast that the agricultural sector will grow by 3.6% a year on average in the forecast period.

Land-acquisition challenges will inhibit faster growth in the industrial sector
The industrial sector will expand at a robust pace as the business environment improves and a robust growth outlook attracts investment and results in an expansion of capacity. We consequently expect the sector to grow by an average rate of 8.5% a year in the forecast period. The share of industry in total GDP will increase marginally from 29.1% in 2017/18 to 30.3% in 2021/22. Manufacturing will, however, continue to be concentrated in a few sectors, such as the automotive industry, and in a few locations, instead of being more broad-based across the country. Government efforts to lift manufacturing employment and output, such as through the "Make in India" initiative (which targets 100m additional jobs in manufacturing and a rise in its share of GDP to 25% by 2022) and the administration's special-economic-zone strategy, which is intended to develop manufacturing hubs throughout the country, are highly ambitious and will miss their targets. In the absence of greater liberalisation of land and labour laws, the industrial expansion will lag behind potential, which will also weigh on employment opportunities.
Accounting for 46.5% of GDP in 2017/18, the services sector will continue to be the main engine of economic expansion. The sector has shown itself to be resilient and efficient, and not entirely dependent on buoyancy in external markets. The sector's expansion will continue to be driven by already strong areas of activity such as telecommunications, as well as by services in numerous high-potential but currently underserved areas, including healthcare, retailing, hospitality and education. Information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services will remain a source of export revenue, even as growth slows as competition from countries such as the Philippines intensifies. Services will form a key sector of the economy in the forecast period, expanding by 9.2% a year on average, and its share of GDP will rise to 47.9% by 2022/23, only slightly higher than in 2017/18.

Prices of food and oil will remain the chief factors driving consumer price pressures in 2018-22. Food and beverages have a weighting of about 45% in the consumer price index, and so any volatility in agricultural output will adversely affect price stability. We expect consumer prices to rise by 4.8% on average in 2018, fuelled by higher crude oil prices. These will feed into sectors which consume large quantities of fuel, such as transport. Nevertheless, food prices will remain generally stable, with increases in agricultural output on the back of a normal monsoon offsetting the effect of higher oil prices. The government's fiscal largesse ahead of the 2019 parliamentary election will lead to greater demand-side price pressures. However, the RBI's tightening of monetary policy in 2018 will ease some of these pressures, and therefore we expect that consumer prices will rise by 4.9% on average in 2019, only slightly quicker than in 2018. As the rupee strengthens, cooling imported inflationary pressures, and crude oil prices dip, annual average inflation will moderate to 4.6% in 2020. Economic growth will subsequently strengthen in 2021-22, and upward demand-side pressures on consumer prices will increase again. A weakening rupee in 2021-22 will add to these inflationary pressures.

We expect the rupee's value to average Rs67.1:US$1 in 2018, with the US dollar strengthening compared with 2017 on the back of the tighter monetary policy adopted by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank). Furthermore, a year-on-year weakening of equity inflows in 2018 will add to the pressure on the rupee. India's persistent dual deficits on the fiscal and current accounts will also keep international investors cautious. We expect the RBI to intervene in foreign-exchange markets to support the currency against sharp depreciation. Although this will help to avert a very sharp decline in the value of the rupee, the broader trend of depreciation will persist in 2019 and the currency will weaken to Rs69.1:US$1 on average in that year. However, we expect the rupee to appreciate against a weakening US dollar in 2020 as the US economy experiences a marked slowdown in that year. Although the RBI will loosen monetary policy in 2020, the stronger growth prospects in India compared with the US in that year will provide support for the rupee. As oil prices pick up again from 2021, the rupee will lose value against the US dollar. We expect this depreciatory trend to persist in 2022, when the rupee's exchange rate will weaken to an annual average of Rs72:US$1.
Depreciatory pressures could be exacerbated by capital outflows if investor confidence in India or emerging markets were to weaken. However, we believe that India's relatively healthy macroeconomic outlook, combined with the central bank's high level of foreign-exchange reserves, will limit the risk of significant exchange-rate volatility.

India's trade deficit will remain wide in 2018-22, with rising prices of crude oil (the country's largest import item in value terms) serving to drive merchandise imports. Exports will grow, but the rate of expansion will remain unflattering when compared with imports. Increasing protectionism in the US will exacerbate trade tensions with that country, which is India's largest export market, and inhibit the pace of growth in exports of both goods and services. Moreover, increasing competition from other countries will hurt India's IT and business-process outsourcing service exports in the forecast period. Although the services balance will remain positive in 2018-22, the rate of expansion in services exports will be relatively tempered, particularly in 2020, when the US undergoes a technical recession. Overall, the wide imbalance on merchandise trade will keep the current account in deficit, equivalent to an average of 2.4% of GDP in 2018-22.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in India
Stocks and flows
India's large market size and growing economy make it a favourable destination for foreign investors. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into India have been strong in recent years, and in 2017 the country received US$40bn in FDI inflows. This compares favourably with an average of US$17.8bn in 2005-07, before the outbreak of the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Owing to an attractive growth outlook and significant market opportunities, the stock of inward FDI has been expanding rapidly, standing at US$377.5bn in 2017, markedly higher than in 2010, when it stood at US$205.6bn. The 2017 figure was also higher than the corresponding stock in Indonesia (US$248.5bn) but significantly lower than in China (US$1.4trn) and Brazil (US$778.3bn).
Origin and distribution
According to the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), the largest source of FDI is Mauritius, which accounted for 34% of FDI inflows between April 2000 and March 2018. Many foreign companies investing in India are incorporated in Mauritius for tax reasons. Singapore was the second most important foreign investor in the same period, accounting for 18% of cumulative inflows, followed by Japan (7%), the UK (7%), the Netherlands (6%) and the US (5%). The most important sector for FDI is services, which attracted US$66.2bn between April 2000 and March 2018 and accounted for 18% of cumulative inflows, according to the DIPP. The computer software and hardware sector is the second-largest recipient, attracting US$30.8bn and accounting for 8% of cumulative inflows. The financial centre, Mumbai, is the largest recipient of FDI, and garnered 31% of total FDI between April 2000 and March 2018. This was followed by the capital, New Delhi, and neighbouring areas, which received 20% of total FDI in the same period.
Determinants
India's skilled, English-speaking workforce has been a significant attraction for FDI, particularly in the information technology (IT) sector. Since coming into office the current government has liberalised the FDI regime in a number of areas, including defence, pharmaceuticals, civil aviation and single-brand retailing. It has also done away with the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, an agency that was tasked with considering and recommending FDI on a case-by-case basis. This onus now falls on individual ministries, and the administration will continue to open up the economy to foreign investors. However, more minor bureaucratic restrictions are often left unaddressed and legal uncertainties often persist, impeding the inflow of investment and hampering the ease of conducting business in India for foreigners.
Impact
FDI has had the greatest impact on India's software industry and IT-enabled services. Call centres and other forms of back-office administration have become important industries, but India is moving up the value chain. The financial, pharmaceutical, telecommunications and power sectors have also been influenced significantly by FDI. The retail sector could be similarly transformed, but a significant relaxation of regulations for multi-brand retailers is unlikely to occur over the forecast period.
Potential
Given the size of its market and rapid economic growth, India is attracting a significant amount of FDI, but the potential for even stronger inflows is hamstrung by relatively poor infrastructure, excessive bureaucracy and wrangling between government departments. The infrastructure, energy, telecoms, IT and insurance sectors are likely to be the key areas for FDI in 2018-22. Producers and assemblers of cars and automotive components are also re-evaluating India's potential, as are biotechnology firms.

Sources: International Labour Organisation (ILO), labour force projections; Economist Intelligence Unit estimates and forecasts; national statistics.
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that the population will grow by 1.1% a year on average in 2018-22, down from 1.2% in 2013-17. This slight slowdown is linked to an improvement in living standards, urbanisation and generally improving economic conditions for women. According to data from the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog, the government's policy think-tank), the total fertility rate fell to 2.3 children per woman in 2015, from 3.2 in 2000. India could reach the replacement level of fertility-2.1 children per woman-within five years. In the coastal states, the fertility rate is already below the replacement rate. However, poor and populous states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar will continue to see strong population growth, adding to social tensions.
High levels of gender disparity will increase the risk of social unrest
The gender distribution of the population has equally important implications for social and political stability. Historically, countries with large gender disparities have tended to suffer from higher levels of social disorder. By 2022 men will outnumber women by 50m. According to the latest census, conducted in 2011, there were just 919 girls for every 1,000 boys under the age of six, marking a decline from the previous census in 2001, which showed that there were 927 girls for every 1,000 boys. More recent research from the National Family Health Survey, conducted in 2015-16, shows that a skewed sex ratio exists across almost the entire country (the gender disparity is more pronounced in urban regions rather than rural areas). This deep gender imbalance will be a source of social tensions-particularly in urban areas-and be fuelled further by the inability of many men to find suitable employment opportunities.
The agricultural sector will continue to employ the bulk of the labour force
Growth in the working-age population will remain relatively strong, at 1.4% a year on average in 2018-22. However, unlocking the economic benefits from a rising population will prove challenging. In the 1990s and 2000s China was able to transfer workers from a relatively unproductive agricultural sector to more productive work in the cities, thereby boosting economic growth and exports. India's manufacturing sector, however, has failed to take off in a similar manner, owing to the comparative lack of legislative and political efforts. The services sector, which is the primary driver of India's economic growth, has failed to create requisite employment opportunities. Agriculture therefore still constitutes the largest share of employment. The share of agriculture in nominal GDP will continue to decline over the forecast period, but this will be gradual and the sector will remain the largest employer in 2018-22.
The pace of job growth in manufacturing will be sluggish
The government hopes to raise job opportunities in employment-heavy sectors like manufacturing, in part through its "Make in India" campaign. However, a failure to pass significant land and labour reforms at national level, in conjunction with a lack of preferential access to major export markets, will put India-based manufacturing companies at a disadvantage. Data from the World Bank show that the share of industry in total employment has stagnated at the 23-24% mark since 2011, and one reason for the slowdown in job growth in industry in recent years has been a deceleration in growth in the construction sector. Although we expect job growth in industry to continue in 2018-22, the pace will be sluggish and insufficient to keep up with the expansion of the labour force.
Weaknesses in the education system will also come to the fore as more students seek secondary and tertiary education. Few universities operate at world-class levels, and the vast majority of graduates appear unequipped for the demands of employers-even in sectors such as engineering, which are crucial for long-term growth. The growing politicisation of the tertiary education sector and lack of clear focus on improving education standards by authorities means that Indian universities will broadly continue to under-perform. A few clusters of excellence will, however, gradually emerge. Competition for entry into the highly regarded Indian Institutes of Technology will intensify. As employment growth and education levels will remain below potential, we believe that India will not be able to realise the potential gains from a rising population fully. People without the necessary literacy and numeracy skills will be constrained to low-paying occupations in the domestic-oriented services sector.

The middle class will continue to grow throughout the forecast period
Rising income levels over the forecast period mean that India's huge population will become an increasingly important market for consumer goods. Household consumption expenditure will rise from US$1.5trn in 2017 to US$2.4trn by 2022. Despite rapid economic growth, GDP per head (at market exchange rates) will remain relatively low at just US$2,811 in 2022, compared with US$12,751 in China and US$10,734 in Brazil in the same year. This will limit the bulk of consumer spending to food and basic necessities. However, this low average masks the presence of a small but growing number of middle-class households, which offers considerable potential for manufacturers and retailers. The rapid growth in personal incomes, combined with a more open domestic market, will make India an increasingly attractive market for foreign companies. Significant regional economic disparities exist and the levels of opportunity for retail businesses will vary greatly across the country in the forecast period.
Growth in the e-commerce segment will be robust
Opportunities for e-commerce will grow rapidly in urban areas, owing to their increasingly well-educated populations and growing penetration of broadband and smartphones. Businesses are already catering to this opportunity, and in May 2018 Wal-Mart (US) announced plans to acquire a majority stake in Flipkart, an Indian e-commerce company. As India continues on a solid growth path in 2018-22, the share of e-commerce in its consumer market will rise, creating opportunities for both domestic and foreign firms. In July the government announced a draft e-commerce policy, which proposes a new e-commerce regulator and a sunset clause on deep discounting by e-retailers. However, some provisions of the draft, particularly those related to mergers and acquisitions, are opposed by businesses, and it is therefore unlikely to be approved in its current form.
As India increasingly joins global value chains and its consumers become more aware of international brands, imports of electronics and consumer goods will rise. Urban consumers tend to display more brand loyalty than their rural counterparts and value loyalty programmes. For most Indians price will remain the main determinant of the level of demand. Companies in the fast-moving consumer goods sector tend to address the affordability issue by offering products in smaller sizes. This practice has been used successfully in emerging markets and offers consumers a way to develop brand loyalty early on.

As in most developing countries, food constitutes by far the largest category of consumer expenditure. Indeed, spending on food as a percentage of income will remain relatively stable over 2018-22. However, this masks that, in US dollar terms, spending in sectors such as leisure and education, as well as health, will pick up noticeably. The relatively poor state of government-provided health services means that as Indians become richer, they will spend an increasingly large amount on healthcare services provided by the private sector. Growth in the leisure and education sector will be fuelled by a rapidly expanding middle class and huge demand for educational services.
Local factors will continue to shape consumer preferences
Several non-income-related factors must be weighed carefully when assessing prospects in the Indian market. First, purchasing power is as location-specific as it is income-sensitive, and prices can vary to a considerable degree even from city to city, let alone between urban and rural areas. Second, cultural factors matter to a significant degree. Third, Indian consumers, including those who are moving up the income scale, are highly price-conscious. Fourth, it is important to note that there is hardly a single characteristic that applies across the entire country. India is a widely varying collection of markets, necessitating a strategic approach that takes regional differences into account. Finally, the steady expansion of consumer finance and the growth of a credit-card culture will increase the number of consumers in the forecast period.

Initial conditions: The Indian economy began to move away from a state-directed socialist model in the early 1990s, when a balance-of-payments crisis triggered the first round of economic reforms and market liberalisation. Since then, India has recorded rapid rates of expansion, with annual real GDP growth averaging 6.2% in fiscal years 1991/92-2017/18 (April-March). However, India's share in world GDP (at market exchange rates) remains far below potential, at around 3.4% in 2017. Meanwhile, the country accounts for 18% of the world's population. This highlights the fact that there is still significant scope for further economic development. Low average productivity in India remains a key reason for widespread poverty. The gap in productivity between the agriculture sector and high-growth industries, such as information technology (IT), is vast. Corruption in local authorities is still endemic, despite the fact that attempts to reduce graft have made progress at the higher levels of government under the Bharatiya Janata Party (which has led the ruling coalition since 2014). India's courts have long suffered from crippling levels of understaffing and a case backlog has built up over decades. However, the judiciary is independent from the government and is in a position to challenge government policies.
A skills mismatch will persist in the workforce
Demographic trends: Continued growth of the working-age population over 2018-50 will the support rapid rate of economic expansion. However, even as the economy grows, a large proportion of the workforce will not find employ-ment in productive formal-sector jobs. By and large, a mismatch between the skills offered by the country's workers and the demands of employers will persist, as the education and vocational training systems will fail to provide sufficient and comprehensive education. The rise of automation and growing use of artificial intelligence will meanwhile dampen employment gains even as India-based enterprises capture a larger market share of the world market for goods and services. Reaping the demographic dividend will prove immensely difficult in this environment. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the vast majority of the workforce to be absorbed by low-productivity occupations in the urban services sector in 2018-50. Still, the expansion of manufacturing and growth in high-technology areas such as telecommunications, IT and pharmaceuticals will offer oppor-tunities to expand employment for India's young and increasingly well-educated workforce.
Migration from poorer states could cause a spike in social tensions
A divergence in economic fortunes within the country will result in strong pressure for Indians from poorer states to move into more prosperous areas. In the absence of major governance improvements, states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar will be a source of internal migrants, putting pressure on scarce resources in cities such as the capital, New Delhi, and the financial hub, Mumbai. There is strong divergence in fertility rates between states, with Uttar Pradesh and Bihar recording high total fertility rates (TFR) of 3.1 and 3.3 respectively in 2016; the more prosperous state of Kerala has a TFR of 1.8 in the same year. This will continue in the long run and the population of Uttar Pradesh alone could surpass 400m by the middle of the century, and significant levels of internal migration will be a source of political and social tensions. Others will look abroad, such as to the Gulf region, for economic opportunities. This will lead to an upsurge in remittances over the next few decades, which will particularly drive economic activity in states with high exposure to workers' remittances such as Kerala.
The unequal gender distribution of India's population will remain a threat to social stability over the outlook period. According to the latest census, conducted in 2011, for every 1,000 boys under the age of six there were only 919 girls, marking a decline from the previous census in 2001, which showed that there were 927 girls for every 1,000 boys. Child mortality rates are higher for girls than boys, and female foeticide is practised. As this trend continues (and there is no evidence to suggest that it will not), a major imbalance between the numbers of men and women will undermine social stability.
External conditions: As its economy expands in size, India will become an increasingly important diplomatic, military and economic power. Successive governments will seek to ensure India's primacy within South Asia and cultivate ties with regional neighbours-excluding Pakistan, India's long-standing rival. We expect India's relationship with Pakistan to remain tense, as the two countries will struggle to reconcile political and strategic differences. Temporary bouts of high tension are likely. However, the growth differential between India and Pakistan will remain high, suggesting that India's military advantage over its rival will increase. Over time, this should deter Pakistan from initiating conflict. China's influential role in Pakistan and its competition for influence in South Asia with India will weigh on bilateral relations between the world's two most populous nations. Shared strategic and economic interests will bind India more closely with Japan and the US. Still, even as it becomes a major diplo-matic power, India will remain hesitant to align itself fully with the West. This is partially related to India's complex relationship with Russia, which has been a major source of military equipment. Averting the possibility of closer Russia-Pakistan ties will remain a foreign policy imperative. Long-standing links with the Gulf region and Africa and deepening investment ties will provide India with the opportunity to expand its political, economic and cultural engagement at a robust pace.
The judicial system will remain independent
Institutions and policy trends: Differing policy trends will emerge as power is increasingly decentralised in the decades ahead and moves to state level. Reform-minded states will see growth accelerate, while poorer states will demand increased funds from the central government to reduce economic disparities. The fight over control of the central government will fuel political instability as regional parties increase in influence and owing to the fact that only a few genuine nationwide parties exist. Despite state-level differences, India's democratic political system will remain firmly entrenched. The country's legal system will generally remain impartial (if slow) and the constitution will continue to be respected. Economic policy and diplomatic efforts will continue to focus on expanding global ties and integration into regional and global value chains. New technologies and the emergence of an increasingly vocal middle class will help the authorities to curb graft, particularly at local level.
Services will continue to dominate the economy in the longer term
Long-term performance: We forecast that India's real GDP growth will average 5.3% a year in 2018-50. The country's economic progress is premised on a shift up the value chain in IT, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, business and information services, as well as other sectors. Continued government-led investment to upgrade infrastructure will improve the business environment and help to enhance the performance of the economy. One major concern over the long-term economic performance is the extent to which the government successfully manages the transition of the labour force from rural into urban areas, in the light of scarce employment opportunities in formal-sector jobs (particularly in the export-oriented manufacturing and services sector). Still, improvements in agricultural procurement practices and greater supply-chain efficiency will make rural India more resilient to weather shocks. A stronger agricultural sector will also temper the movement of Indians from rural to urban areas and the urban population will overtake the rural one only by the middle of this century.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends
Climate change and sustainability
India will remain vulnerable to climate change and adverse changes in monsoon patterns could severely affect its agricultural sector, which remains highly rain-dependent. More generally, water scarcity will become a challenge. The government has taken steps to manage the effects of climate change, and increasingly more attention will be given to this issue. However, given the scale of environmental challenges India faces, policy measures are unlikely to reduce the country's vulnerability to climate change significantly.
India is already the world's third-largest consumer of energy, and demand will continue to grow over the forecast period. In order to add to its energy capacity as well as meet its commitments under the Paris climate accord, the government is making efforts to diversify from conventional sources of energy, such as coal-fired thermal power stations. India is one of the most active members of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), which promotes the transition to solar energy, and the ISA has established its headquarters in Gurgaon. The ISA aims to raise US$1trn in financing and install 1,000 GW of solar capacity across its 121 member states by 2030. India is likely to utilise the platform provided by the ISA to leverage funding and assistance from developed nations and multilateral agencies to develop its own solar sector.
The country has also been making strides in developing wind energy. The National Institute for Wind Energy has estimated India's wind power potential at 302 GW, with the states of Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Rajasthan having the greatest potential. Serious efforts in this regard have started; India's installed capacity in wind energy is now the world's fourth largest.
According to the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog, the government's policy think-tank), around 304m people in India lived without electricity in 2017. Consequently, even as renewable sources of energy will make advances, the significant gap between supply and demand in energy will mean that coal-fired thermal power plants remain critical to India's energy mix.
Migration and urbanisation
India will continue to see an influx of immigrants to urban areas, as workers move to cities in search of better-paying employment. Increasingly, public policy, which has long been rural-oriented, will tilt more towards resolving overcrowding, poor housing conditions, anaemic infrastructure and rising unsustainability in urban centres. However, the enormous scale of these challenges and limited government effectiveness will temper the pace of progress in major cities.
The biggest challenge for policymakers will be skilling and training the workforce of rural immigrants, as they will largely move from the low-skilled agricultural sector and will be less proficient in the expertise required for productive employability in services and industry.
Meanwhile, emigration to Western countries, particularly the US and Canada, as well as to the prosperous states of the Gulf, like the UAE, will remain strong. Consequently, India will remain one of the largest recipients of remittances in the coming years.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2013-17) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2018-22). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2013-17. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2018-22 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2013-17 ranges are then used to derive 2018-22 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2018-22, not to the likely situation in 2022 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2015 or 2020). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. Since the 2010 crisis the traditional party system has broken down. [...]this remains a disappointing rate of expansion in the context of the slump of the past decade. [...]the recent wildfires may damage the tourism sector, and external developments (notably the threat of a global trade war) are a cause for concern. 2013a 2014a 2015a 2016a 2017a 2018b 2019b 2020b 2021b 2022b The labour market (av) Labour force (m) 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.7 4.7 4.7 4.7 Labour force (% change) -0.9 -0.9 -0.1 -0.1 -0.3 -0.3 -0.3 -0.3 -0.4 -0.5 Employment (m) 3.5 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.7 3.8 3.8 3.9 3.9 4.0 Employment (% change) -4.9 0.5 1.9 1.8 2.4 1.6 1.1 1.0 1.0 1.0 Unemployment (m) 1.3 1.3 1.2 1.1 1.0 0.9 0.9 0.8 0.8 0.7 Unemployment rate (av; %) 27.5 26.6 25.0 23.5 21.5 20.0 18.9 17.8 16.6 15.4 Wage and price inflation (% except labour costs per hour) Consumer prices (av) -0.9 -1.3 -1.7 -0.8 1.1 0.7 1.3 1.5 1.6 1.5 Consumer prices (av; EU harmonised measure) -0.8 -1.4 -1.1 0.0 1.1 0.7 1.3 1.5 1.6 1.5 Producer prices (av) -0.7 -0.8 -5.8 -5.4 4.2 3.3 2.7 2.8 2.8 2.8 GDP deflator (av) -2.6 -1.9 -1.0 -0.9 0.6 0.1 0.6 1.5 1.0 0.6 Private consumption deflator (av) -1.8 -2.6 -1.4 -0.9 1.1 0.9 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.0 Government consumption deflator (av) -5.7 -1.0 -2.2 -0.4 1.9 -0.3 -0.2 1.5 1.6 1.5 Fixed investment deflator (av) -0.2 -2.8 -0.7 -1.7 0.1 -1.0 0.5 1.0 1.0 1.0 Average nominal wages -10.1 0.5 -0.9 1.3 0.8 0.7 1.6 1.8 1.9 1.8 Average real wages -9.2 1.8 0.8 2.2 -0.3 0.0 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 Unit labour costs ([euro]-based; av) -11.9 -0.2 0.8 2.9 0.0c -0.1 0.2 0.6 0.6 0.4 Unit labour costs, business sector (US$) -8.9 -0.2 -15.8 2.6 3.4c 5.7 0.0 2.0 0.8 2.4 Labour costs per hour ([euro])d 13.6 13.7 13.6 13.9 14.0c 14.2 14.4 14.7 15.1 15.4 Labour costs per hour, manufacturing (US$)d 18.1 18.2 15.1 15.3 15.8c 16.9 17.2 17.8 18.3 19.0 a Actual.b Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts.c Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.d Includes pay for time worked, other direct pay (eg holiday pay), employer expenditure on legally required insurance programmes and other labour taxes.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The government-comprising Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza, the party of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras) and the small, right-wing Independent Greeks (AE)-has a two-seat majority in the 300-seat parliament. The government is vulnerable to further defections and there is a significant risk of an early election (it is not due until October 2019). The centre-right New Democracy (ND) is likely to win the most seats and form a coalition government.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Greece to remain subject to strict policy conditionality over the medium term and until its debt to its international creditors is substantially reduced. Protests over labour market reforms, pension cuts, privatisation, and tax and social security increases are likely to continue as the government strives to meet the ambitious annual primary surplus budget target of 3.5% of GDP until 2022, as agreed with Greece's euro zone creditors.
Greece will face its biggest macroeconomic challenge after it exits the bail-out programme, in August 2018. How the economy performs during the transition will determine whether Greece will remain in the euro zone. We assess the risk of it leaving the zone by 2022 at more than 50%, given the difficulties that it will face in attaining rapid growth while meeting large primary surplus targets and restoring competitiveness without a currency devaluation. We expect that public debt will still exceed 170% of GDP in 2022.
Greece does not face short-term financing difficulties as it will have sufficient funds to cover its debt repayments for almost two years after it exits the bail-out programme this month. However, the challenges posed by the very high public debt burden and a poor growth outlook mean that Grexit will remain a significant risk in the medium and long term.
We forecast that annual average inflation will edge down from 1.1% in 2017 to 0.7% in 2018, before accelerating to an annual average of 1.5% in 2019-22, reflecting higher oil prices and a pick-up in domestic demand. These trends will result in widening, but still moderate, current-account deficits in 2018-22.

Greece's score recovers modestly in our 2018-22 forecast period, from a low base. The main areas of improvement are expected in the macroeconomic environment and as a result of efforts to improve policy towards foreign investment, private enterprise and competition, and the labour market.
Country forecast overview: Greece's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: The country's privatisation agency, under new management, gains momentum. Deals start to make progress.
2020-22: Efforts to valorise public property through concession management and long-leasehold development agreements.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: The Investment Incentives Law of 2016 offers more tax relief and fewer subsidies, and focuses predominantly on small firms. Plans to cut down on bureaucracy make little progress.
2020-22: "Fast-track" legislation could become more important if the economy normalises. It will cover "strategic" investments in energy, tourism, transport, communications and health.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Capital controls introduced in June 2015 are eased gradually. The risk of Greece leaving the euro area and reintroducing exchange controls and, possibly, restrictions on trade will remain high after exit from the European Stability Mechanism.
2020-22: There is a 60% risk of Greece leaving the euro zone if growth continues to disappoint.
Taxes
2018-19: Extensive efforts to widen the tax base. Government pledges to pursue aggressive tax collection, but implementation is difficult. Indirect taxes increase. Mandatory introduction of electronic point of sale terminals helps.
2020-22: Limited progress in cutting corporate income tax or value-added tax (VAT). Measures to tackle tax evasion stepped up. Independence of the tax authority remains in doubt.
Financing
2018-19: Liquidity tight. Uncertainty constrains lending capacity. Steps to reduce non-performing loans (NPLs) painfully slow, but foreign interest picks up. A moratorium on foreclosures is lifted for the majority of debtors.
2020-22: Lending hampered by need to make provisions for still high NPL portfolios. Greece's main banks sell more of their overseas subsidiaries. Some form of normalcy in sight towards the end of this period.
The labour market
2018-19: Labour market reforms now mostly passed, but implementation is problematic. Unemployment remains high.

Background: After 400 years of Ottoman rule, Greece emerged as a sovereign state in 1830. A devastating civil war followed the retreat of German occupying forces in 1944. A military junta ruled the country from 1967 to 1974, but since then a democracy has been in place. In 1981 Greece joined the European Economic Community, now the EU. It became a member of economic and monetary union (EMU) in 2001, but its public finances became unsustainable, resulting in a sovereign debt crisis in 2009-10. Greece's public debt has put its continued membership of EMU in question.
Political structure: Greece is a parliamentary republic, with deputies elected for four-year terms. The prime minister and the government hold executive powers. The president is elected by the 300-member parliament for a five-year term. The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. Since the 2010 crisis the traditional party system has broken down. Voters have blamed the parties that ruled Greece after the return of democracy in the mid-1970s-New Democracy (ND) and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok)-for causing the crisis, which led to the imposition of painful austerity by the country's external creditors. The result has been political fragmentation and the rise of populist parties such as the left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), which came to power in 2015, and far-right parties such as the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (XA).
Policy issues: The ND-Pasok government of 2012-14, like its two predecessors, imposed draconian austerity packages. It also enacted fiscal and some structural economic reforms to meet the conditions of two EU-IMF bail-out packages totalling EUR240bn. Implementation proved difficult and ultimately brought down the government. After a seven-month confrontation with Greece's creditors, the Syriza-led government negotiated a new three-year European Stability Mechanism programme. In 2012 public debt held by the private sector was restructured. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any further debt write-down. After Greece exits the programme when it expires in August 2018, the country will be subject to much closer scrutiny by its creditors than other EU member states have been after they exited their programmes.
Taxation: The tax rate on corporate profits is 29% and on distributed dividends is 10%. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45% for income of more than EUR40,000. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at rates of 24%, 13% and 6%.
Foreign trade: In 2017 goods exports (fob) were worth EUR27.9bn (US$31.5bn) and imports (fob) amounted to EUR46.3bn. The current account registered a deficit of EUR1.4bn, equivalent to 0.8% of GDP.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
The coalition government-comprising Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), the party of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, and the small, right-wing nationalist Independent Greeks (AE)-has survived since September 2015, despite having only a slim majority in the 300-seat parliament. Following the defection of two members of the AE, in protest at the agreement on the 27-year Macedonia name dispute, the government's majority has been reduced to just two seats. Mr Tsipras will aim to see through his parliamentary term, which ends in October 2019, but there is a significant risk of a pre-term election.
The government has been badly damaged by the authorities' handling of the emergency caused by wildfires in the Attica region in July, which resulted in the deaths of more than 90 people. The alternate minister for civil protection, Nikos Toskas, resigned on August 3rd, but the electorate will hold the entire government to account for the death toll from the disaster. Coming in the wake of more than 20 deaths caused by flash floods west of Athens in November 2017, the wildfires tragedy has heightened public anger over the shortcomings of government and public administration. As a consequence, the government is likely to be punished at the next election.
In August 2015, for the third time since 2010, the government tied its acceptance of bail-out reforms under a European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme to the objective of receiving debt relief from its official creditors. (The ESM is an inter-governmental assistance fund for countries in the euro zone.) Almost three years later, the government is on the verge of exiting the programme with minimal debt relief, and has lost much popular support along the way. Mr Tsipras aims to revive his party's political fortunes once Greece exits the programme, and will be hoping that economic growth gains momentum over the coming year.
Tensions within the government coalition will persist, including over the continued implementation of austerity measures and the Macedonia name issue. The AE has said that it will oppose the name agreement when it is brought before parliament and the senior ruling party may struggle to obtain the required majority.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
Syriza trails in opinion polls behind the centre-right New Democracy (ND), led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis; the gap has been above 10 percentage points for some time. ND's lead may narrow during the election campaign, as Mr Tsipras is a formidable campaigner and there is little overt enthusiasm for Mr Mitsotakis or his party. However, given widespread popular disaffection with the government, the election-due by October 2019-is ND's to lose. If, as The Economist Intelligence Unit expects, ND wins the largest share of the vote, it would benefit from the 50-seat bonus rule for the winning party. Even so, it would probably have to secure the support of at least one other party to muster a parliamentary majority.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
On June 12th Mr Tsipras and Zoran Zaev, the prime minister of Macedonia (the official name of which is the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; the constitutional name is the Republic of Macedonia), announced their agreement to change that country's constitutional name to Severna Makedonija (North Macedonia). The two leaders attended a ceremony on June 17th in the Prespes district of northern Greece, at which their respective foreign ministers, Nikos Kotzias and Nikola Dimitrov, signed an agreement on the change. The breakthrough is only the first step towards a resolution of the name dispute, and-given public opposition in both countries-the agreement may fail to come into effect. Macedonia's parliament has approved the agreement, which will be put to a referendum on September 30th, before being presented in the Greek parliament early next year.
Tensions between Greece and Turkey have risen recently. The risk of military confrontation is high, particularly in the Aegean Sea, but both sides will seek to avoid clashes. Points of contention-such as historical territorial disputes in the Aegean, the Greek courts' rejection of Turkey's extradition request for Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece on the night of the July 2016 failed coup in Turkey, and the arrest in March 2018 by Turkish police of two Greek soldiers on patrol in the border area of Evros for alleged espionage-continue to fuel distrust.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
On August 20th Greece will emerge from an eight-year period (2010-18) during which it has received a total of EUR274bn (US$323bn) in official financial support from European creditors and the IMF (EUR32.1bn from the latter) and has been subject to three economic adjustment programmes. Repaying the country's outstanding public debt, which totalled EUR344bn (about 180% of GDP) at the end of March, means that future Greek governments will be subject to huge policy constraints. Fiscal austerity and policy conditionality will remain in place for the next five years and beyond.
At the June 21st meeting of the Eurogroup, Greece's official creditors agreed to close the final review of the third bail-out programme, paving the way for a disbursement of EUR15bn, which was released on August 6th. Of this, EUR3.3bn will be used to pay down the more expensive IMF debt, and the balance will form part of a buffer for Greece to use while it builds up market access. The total buffer, estimated at EUR24.1bn, should be sufficient to cover almost two years of the country's financing needs. This is more onerous than a precautionary credit line would have been, as Greece will be accruing interest on money it does not currently need. However, intense political pressure not to invite further policy conditionality led the government to choose the more expensive option.
The Eurogroup meeting agreed to further debt relief for Greece, which was granted a ten-year grace period and a ten-year maturity extension on EUR96bn of its loans (provided by the European Financial Stability Facility). It will also get a reduction in the interest rates (for loans of EUR130.9bn) and a return of profits from the securities market programme and from the Agreement on Net Financial Assets relating to official sector holders of Greek debt-the European Central Bank (ECB) and national central banks of euro area countries-estimated at around EUR5bn.
Greece, in return, has committed to long-term fiscal prudence. It must achieve annual primary budget surpluses of 3.5% of GDP in the 2018-22 forecast period and 2.2% of GDP thereafter, until 2060. It will also be subject to an "enhanced surveillance" regime, which is a more exacting system of post-programme monitoring than those applied to other former bail-out countries. The debt-relief measures will be subject to quarterly reviews of the state of the economy and of the government's adherence to its commitments. As these reviews will be published, transgression by Greece would adversely affect market access.
After a three-year absence, Greece has returned to the financial markets three times since July 2017. However, after August it will do so without the backstop of an official credit line. Global financial volatility delayed the issuance of a seven-year bond in February, highlighting the kind of difficulties that the country could face in future. Greece should have sufficient funds to meet its financing needs in the short term, through to early 2020. However, in the medium and long term, the political and, arguably, the economic price of meeting high annual primary surplus targets may become unbearable. During the past two years, Greece has exceeded its annual primary surplus targets, but at the expense of economic growth, which has been disappointing. Meeting such targets will remain a constraint on growth, alongside other negative factors, such as poor demographics and a weak business environment. Grexit is not a short-term risk, but, given that Greece is highly unlikely to improve competitiveness inside the euro zone or grow its way out of its huge debt burden, it will pose a significant risk in the medium and long term.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
In 2017 the budget surplus was equivalent to 0.8% of GDP and the primary surplus (budget balance minus interest payments) exceeded the bail-out programme target of 1.75% of GDP, coming in at 4% of GDP. We expect a minimal budget deficit in 2018 (0.3% of GDP), but we do not expect Greece to meet its annual primary surplus target of 3.5% of GDP this year, or in 2019-22. We forecast that the deficit will widen gradually during this period, reflecting constraints on revenue collection, a relaxation of spending restraint and only modest economic growth.
The restructuring of government debt to the private sector cut the debt/GDP ratio to 159.4% at end-2012, from 171.9% in 2011. However, large primary surpluses in 2016-17 were insufficient to arrest the growth of gross consolidated government debt, which rose to EUR317.4bn, or 179.1% of GDP, in 2017. Government debt is now almost entirely owed to official creditors. We expect that, without a debt write-down and assuming moderate nominal medium-term GDP growth rates, the public debt/GDP ratio will remain above 170% in 2018-22.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The ECB is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a quantitative easing (QE) programme that ran at EUR60bn per month until the end of 2017 and is running at EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018. The ECB's view of the outlook improved during 2017 and, although economic activity in the euro zone softened in early 2018, the bank is now more upbeat. We expect monthly asset purchases under the QE programme to conclude at the end of 2018. Rising commodity prices and evidence of growing domestic price pressure in some parts of the zone should mean that sufficient inflationary pressures will begin to emerge in 2019-20. We expect the ECB to take steps towards normalising its policy stance, with an increase of 25 basis points in the main refinancing rate, to 0.25% in early 2020, followed by five more rises that will lift the rate to 1.5% by end-2022. An increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019, easing the pressure on banks' lending margins and supporting profitability.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Compared with 2007 levels, real GDP has shrunk by more than one-quarter, government consumption by almost one-quarter, household consumption by one-fifth and gross fixed investment by almost two-thirds. The recovery, which began at the start of 2017, is fragile and vulnerable to domestic and external developments, as shown by a marked slowdown in activity in quarterly terms in the second half of last year. We forecast that real GDP growth will pick up from 1.3% in 2017 to average 1.9% per year in 2018-22. The risks to our forecast are balanced. Upside risks include a continued strong tourism performance. Downside risks include the frailty of the banking sector and political instability.
Seasonally and calendar day-adjusted real GDP expanded by 0.8% quarter on quarter and by 2.3% year on year in January-March. Some high-frequency data-notably for tourism-are showing signs of strength, and sentiment has improved, especially in the services sector. We have therefore revised up our 2018 real GDP growth forecast to 2%, from 1.8%. Nevertheless, this remains a disappointing rate of expansion in the context of the slump of the past decade. Moreover, the recent wildfires may damage the tourism sector, and external developments (notably the threat of a global trade war) are a cause for concern. We expect a combination of more and higher taxes, higher social security payments, debt repayments and spending cuts to put pressure on household disposable income. Although we expect a modest acceleration in household spending in 2018-22, this will be from a low base and will be constrained by primary surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP per year, continued high unemployment and insipid lending growth.
A welcome development in 2017 was a sharp acceleration in fixed investment growth, albeit from a low base. We expect the momentum to continue in 2018 and beyond, with fixed investment growth averaging 5% per year in 2018-22. However, underinvestment during the crisis, and the depletion of Greece's capital stock, as well as uncertainty about the country's euro zone membership, are likely to restrict growth potential in the medium term.
Greece's external trade will be constrained by its relatively uncompetitive goods exports. Over the medium term, we expect tourism to support services export growth, contributing to annual average growth of exports of goods and services of 5.2% in 2018-22.
Greece will face its biggest macroeconomic challenge after it exits the bail-out programme. How the economy performs over the next five years and beyond will determine whether the country will remain in the euro zone. We assess the risk of Greece leaving the zone by 2022 as above 50%, given the difficulties that it will face in attaining rapid growth while meeting large primary surplus targets, and in restoring competitiveness without a currency devaluation. Grexit would lead to a sovereign default and a severe recession in the first few years, but the economy would then grow rapidly, assuming a responsible fiscal policy guided by the need to achieve a primary surplus. Growth rates under this scenario would be faster than those in our medium-term forecast. We have not incorporated Grexit into our forecast numbers.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
After stagnating in 2016, Greece's seasonally adjusted EU harmonised index of consumer prices rose by 1.1% year on year in 2017, driven by higher global energy prices, notably in the fourth quarter. Inflation dipped sharply at the start of 2018, rising by just 0.3% year on year in the first quarter, before accelerating to 0.7% in the second. Economic growth is picking up, but significant slack remains in the labour market and domestic demand is subdued. Despite rising global commodity prices and increased tourism, we expect annual inflation to edge down this year, to an average of 0.7%. We forecast a pick-up to inflation of 1.5% per year on average in 2019-22 as the pace of growth quickens.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
The euro exchange rate peaked at almost US$1.25:EUR1 at the start of February but had weakened to US$1.16:EUR1 by late May in response to the formation of a populist, Eurosceptic government in Italy, and remained close to that level in June, July and early August. The euro could come under further pressure from political risk in Italy, and also from US monetary tightening. Nonetheless, we expect a broad stabilisation, with an average exchange rate of US$1.20:EUR1 in 2018-21, as the euro is supported by ongoing recovery in the region and receives structural support from a large regional current-account surplus, while the business-cycle downturn in the US will weigh on the dollar in 2020. Thereafter, we expect the euro to appreciate to US$1.24:EUR1 on average in 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
Greece's current-account deficit has narrowed since the start of the crisis. This mainly reflects the compression of imports owing to contracting domestic demand, but is also partly the result of improved competitiveness in the tourism sector. The current-account deficit narrowed to 0.8% of GDP in 2017, from 1.1% of GDP in 2016, according to the Bank of Greece (the central bank). We forecast widening deficits in 2018-22 as import prices rise and import volumes pick up in line with higher domestic demand, but these will be much smaller than the average annual deficit of 7.2% of GDP since Greece joined the euro zone in 2001.

Abstract: To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup, power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president and leader of the AKP, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. The state of emergency was introduced after the failed coup attempt to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric who is accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. Since 2016 the state of emergency had allowed the government to continue its campaign against political opponents, critics and perceived enemies of the state, to curtail freedoms of expression, assembly and association, and to politicise the judiciary. Turkey's involvement in the conflict in Syria will continue to influence the direction of its foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, but the level of trust between them is still low, particularly regarding the conflict in Syria, where they are co-operating but have been pursuing contrasting goals. [...]the central government deficit, which captures most of the public-sector expenses, expanded from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to 1.5% in 2017.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
On June 24th Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected as president for a second term in snap presidential and parliamentary elections, in which his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a coalition majority in parliament with the right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP).
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Mr Erdogan and the AKP to remain in power throughout the forecast period (2018-22), and possibly beyond.
Following the June elections, an executive presidency now replaces the former parliamentary system of government. The new system will provide few checks on the president's powers, raising the risk of discretionary policymaking.
Since the failed coup in 2016, there has been a marked deterioration in Turkey's relations with its Western allies. We expect a complete rupture to be avoided, but tensions will remain high.
Turkey's relationship with the US will deteriorate in 2018-22, owing to bilateral tensions that appear hard to resolve. The possible US imposition of sanctions on Turkish banks for evading US Iran-related sanctions is a risk.
Turkey's relationship with the EU will become increasingly transactional. Turkey will not make progress with accession talks and is unlikely to manage to renegotiate the terms of its customs union with the EU.
Uncertainty about the direction of Turkey's economic policy continues to cloud the country's medium-term economic outlook. The government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign-policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate.
We forecast a slowdown in real GDP growth from 7.3% in 2017 to about 4.2% per year in 2018-22, reflecting higher taxes, higher interest rates, a gradual tightening of global liquidity and more moderate export growth.
The lira will depreciate in nominal terms against the US dollar throughout our forecast period, to almost TL5:US$1 at end-2022, as a result of negative foreign investor sentiment, high inflation and a large current-account deficit.
We expect the current-account deficit to widen in 2018, to 6.7% of GDP, before contracting to a still large 4.8% per year on average in 2019-22. Turkey will struggle to meet its high external financing needs throughout our forecast period.

Turkey's score deteriorates only slightly in 2018-22, but in the global rankings the country falls by ten places, to 59th. There is consensus among policymakers on the need to maintain macroeconomic stability. However, the failed coup and the government's response have increased the level of uncertainty about the direction of policy. Shortcomings include a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Privatisations are likely to be delayed amid the post-coup upheaval in the state institutions. Some companies, notably those with media holdings or ties with the Gulenist movement, remain subject to heavy-handed state intervention.
2020-22: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2020-22: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Capital controls are not considered. There is a boost to trade and tourism following the lifting of Russian sanctions.
2020-22: Negotiations with the EU to update the customs union are likely to be protracted, given poor Turkish-EU relations.
Taxes
2018-19: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Some tax rate rises, including on company profits, are introduced in 2018 to curb the widening of the budget deficit.
2020-22: Income tax base becomes broader as exemptions and exceptions are reduced.
Financing
2018-19: Political pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey not to raise interest rates significantly remains possible. The US could impose fines on several Turkish banks over alleged violations of US sanctions on Iran.
2020-22: Banking system remains stable, despite weaknesses. Heavy reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2018-19: Relatively high labour costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment.
2020-22: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2018-19: First phase of third airport in Istanbul becomes operational. Slower progress on other projects.
2020-22: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks might persist.
Technological readiness
2018-19: Spending on research and development remains moderate, at about 1% of GDP, holding back efforts to move the economy up the value-added ladder.
2020-22: Turkey's young population spurs further rapid digital transformation of the banking sector.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then, Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe (in 1949) and NATO (in 1952), and signed an association agreement with the then European Community (in 1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but the coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey currently has a unicameral parliamentary system of government, with parliament elected for a five-year term. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup, power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president and leader of the AKP, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. Following his re-election, a presidential system of government is being introduced and the post of prime minister has been abolished.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability is Turkey's biggest policy challenge. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and changing global liquidity conditions require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy relatively tight to attract adequate capital inflows. The Kurdish issue, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is one of Turkey's most pressing policy challenges, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015, and there has been a resurgence in violence. The failed coup highlighted institutional weaknesses that, with the AKP's consent until 2013, had allowed the secretive Gulenist movement to infiltrate the state. Politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The corporation tax rate has been raised in 2018, from 20% to 22%. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Reducing tax evasion was one of the elements of previous IMF programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2017 goods exports came to US$166bn and imports to US$225bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$59bn and a current account deficit of US$47bn (or 5.6% of GDP). The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
In June Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected as president for a second term in the first round of a snap presidential election. On the same day, Mr Erdogan's conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a parliamentary coalition majority with its right-wing ally, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP). Both votes took place well ahead of the originally scheduled date of November 2019, as the president sought to take advantage of his current popularity. The election process appeared mostly free, but largely unfair. Opposition candidates received little or no media coverage; the candidate of the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP), Selahattin Demirtas, had to campaign from prison; and the government restrains freedom of speech and freedom of association. However, the outcome of the elections appeared clear; Mr Erdogan secured a majority of the vote on a high turnout. In addition, results published by opposition observers almost mirrored those announced by the government.
Mr Erdogan's re-election concludes Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. This move was initiated with a constitutional referendum in April 2017, which the government narrowly won. The new system will grant the president wide-ranging executive powers-including in the selection of most of the officials in the judiciary-and will greatly weaken parliament. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that the AKP and Mr Erdogan, who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, will remain in power until 2023, and possibly beyond.
Mr Erdogan will continue to clamp down on domestic political dissent and opposition. Despite lifting the state of emergency when it expired on July 18th, the government is considering adopting stringent impediments on freedoms that would resemble those imposed as part of its terms. The state of emergency was introduced after the failed coup attempt to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric who is accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. Since 2016 the state of emergency had allowed the government to continue its campaign against political opponents, critics and perceived enemies of the state, to curtail freedoms of expression, assembly and association, and to politicise the judiciary.
The operational capacity problems created by the purge of the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) and the police after the attempted coup appear to have eased, but security risk remains high. Turkey is vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Islamic State (IS). Neither the government nor the PKK are interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will return to 1990s levels. Turkey's military operations in Syria seek to block the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds affiliated with the PKK, but risk fuelling the conflict with the PKK in Turkey's south-east. The formation of a governing coalition between the AKP and the MHP will have a detrimental effect on attempts to resolve the Kurdish issue, as the MHP is likely to push for hawkish policies aimed at constraining and delegitimising the HDP. In addition, the MHP will advocate repatriation of Syrian refugees and adopt a tough stance on all issues related to national security, in line with Mr Erdogan's ultra-nationalist and conservative views.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
Parliamentary and presidential elections were held on June 24th, earlier than the originally scheduled date of late 2019. The elections were brought forward for several reasons: high and growing economic uncertainties; the continued high popularity of Mr Erdogan and the AKP; and the rise in nationalist sentiment in the context of Turkey's military operations in northern Syria.
Mr Erdogan was re-elected as president in the first round, securing 52.6% of the vote on a turnout of 86.2%. In the parliamentary election, the AKP lost its absolute majority (although it secured a coalition majority alongside its partner, the MHP) because the HDP polled above 10% of the vote-the threshold needed to enter parliament-despite Mr Erdogan's repeated attempts to weaken it. The AKP received 42.6% of the vote; the MHP got 11.1%; the Republican People's Party (CHP) 22.6%; the HDP 11.7%; and the Good Party (IP) 10%.
Local elections will be held as planned in March 2019, despite recent signals from the AKP that point to an increasing possibility of bringing them forward to November or December. The AKP-MHP coalition would have an interest in holding these elections early, while the economic situation remains favourable. However, the coalition would struggle to pass the necessary constitutional amendment in parliament. The shift of focus to the local polls in the aftermath of the June elections is a sign that Turkey will remain in election mood until next year. Mr Erdogan and the AKP will therefore refrain from any decisions that could jeopardise the AKP's success in the local elections.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign policy sphere. Although not our core forecast, there is a risk of a rupture in the country's ties with its traditional Western allies. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration in relations, including a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup; US military backing for PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurdish groups; the Turkish government's authoritarian tendencies and its strident anti-Western rhetoric; tensions over gas exploration in the eastern Mediterranean; Turkey's forging of closer relations with countries such as China, Russia and Iran; and, more recently, growing tensions with Israel in the aftermath of the US government's decision to relocate its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Turkey's confrontational approach to its Western allies should be viewed partly in the context of Mr Erdogan's need to maintain the support of his country's nationalists to achieve his domestic political goals-notably, to implement an executive presidential system now that he has been re-elected as president.
The country's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and increasingly transactional rather than strategic, but we expect Turkey and its Western allies to avoid a complete breakdown in relations. However, this might become unavoidable if the EU suspends Turkey's moribund accession negotiations, if the migrant deal with the EU collapses, if the US imposes sanctions on Turkey over violations by Turkish banks of US sanctions against Iran, or if Turkey closes the Incirlik air base to US forces or withdraws from NATO, none of which can be ruled out. Operation Olive Branch, Turkey's crossborder military operation in Afrin in north-western Syria, which was launched in January 2018, has accentuated tensions with the US.
Turkey's involvement in the conflict in Syria will continue to influence the direction of its foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, but the level of trust between them is still low, particularly regarding the conflict in Syria, where they are co-operating but have been pursuing contrasting goals. We expect relations to continue to be largely transactional. The risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Turkey's economy has shown resilience during past bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing largely to its solid public finances, its well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector, and its dynamic, diversified private business sector. However, an intensification of domestic political instability, rising regional tensions and tightening global liquidity conditions could disrupt foreign capital inflows during the 2018-22 forecast period.
These inflows are needed to meet the country's large external financing requirements (savings have always been low), but tend to be short-term and highly volatile. Shifts in capital flows, triggered by expectations of tighter US monetary policy and geopolitical tensions in the neighbouring region, have put the lira under severe pressure on several occasions since late 2016, most recently in May-July 2018, fuelling a sharp acceleration in inflation as well as increasing the cost to firms of servicing their foreign debt (in local-currency terms) and thereby raising the risk of defaults for corporates.
Uncertainty about the direction of Turkey's economic policy continues to cloud the country's medium-term economic outlook. The government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. The current direction of policy appears to be towards fiscal loosening and relatively tight, but not tightening, monetary policy.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios-reflecting the positive impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past and major upward revisions to Turkey's national accounts-have given the government some leeway to loosen fiscal policy to support the economy in the aftermath of the July 2016 attempted coup. As a result, the central government deficit, which captures most of the public-sector expenses, expanded from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to 1.5% in 2017.
Despite a series of tax increases this year, increased government spending on defence, security, infrastructure projects, public employment and social benefits will cause the deficit to widen further, to an annual average of 3% of GDP in 2018-19, before narrowing gradually to 1.8% in 2022. We expect the central government debt/GDP ratio to decline gradually, from 28.3% of GDP at end-2017 to 26.4% in 2022. Our baseline forecast is predicated on the assumption that fiscal policy will be kept relatively tight to support investor confidence.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The Central Bank of Turkey will have to keep its monetary policy tight in 2018 in order to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent further depreciation of the lira against the US dollar amid political volatility, higher US interest rates and balance-sheet tapering by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank). A 300-basis-point rise in the late liquidity window lending rate on May 23rd and a further 100-basis point rise (to 17.75%) in the key lending rate on June 7th had indicated that economic orthodoxy was beginning to overcome political pressures not to raise interest rates. However, on July 24th the central bank decided not to increase rates further, despite record high inflation and the sharp depreciation of the lira against the dollar in May-July. This suggests that persistent political pressure will ensure that the central bank has only limited room for manoeuvre during the rest of the year to tighten monetary policy. This may be the result of government concerns about a likely deceleration of real GDP growth in the second half of the year.
We therefore believe that the central bank will not be able to raise rates to levels that would be credible in terms of bringing inflation down to its (highly unrealistic) 5% target in the medium term. Amid a context of increasing regional tensions, tightening global liquidity conditions and rising inflation in the short term, the central bank is likely to be unable to maintain investor confidence if financial conditions deteriorate, possibly prompting the imposition of capital controls; however, this is not our baseline scenario.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Real GDP growth accelerated sharply in 2017, to 7.3% (from 3.3% in 2016), supported by government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand. In 2018 we expect growth to slow to 4%. This deceleration reflects the impact of tax increases, higher interest rates, a gradual tightening of global liquidity (feeding into a depreciation of the lira), increased domestic instability and higher inflation, all of which will offset planned stimulus measures to boost employment and investment. There are considerable downside risks to our forecast, stemming from foreign capital inflows being deterred by further political instability in the transition to a presidential system of government, regional tensions, domestic financial fragilities and the higher interest-rate environment in advanced economies. We forecast that real GDP growth will average 4.3% per year in 2019-22.
We expect household consumption growth to moderate from 6% of GDP in 2017 to a still solid 3.7% per year in 2018-22 as a result of higher interest rates and slower employment growth. We expect government consumption growth to accelerate from 5.1% in 2017 to an annual average of 5.8% in 2018-19, easing to a more moderate but still robust average of 4.8% in 2020-22.
The deterioration in the business environment and the reduction in foreign investors' confidence since the attempted coup in 2016, and an increase in the corporation tax rate to 22% from 2018 will continue to hold down private-sector fixed investment growth. However, we expect this to be offset by government investment, especially in infrastructure. In 2020-22 we forecast a deceleration in yearly investment growth, reflecting public-sector retrenchment and firms' response to a more moderate expansion of domestic and external demand.
The lifting in June 2017 of Russian sanctions on Turkey (notably in the tourism sector), the positive effect on export competitiveness of the lira's depreciation against the US dollar, and strong external demand have contributed to a rebound in exports of goods and services. However, we expect export growth to slow in 2018-22, owing to global trade tensions following the US decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. We expect a nominal depreciation of the lira against the US dollar and the euro during the forecast period; this will dampen import growth but support external competitiveness.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Consumer price inflation is stubbornly high-well above the official 5% medium-term target, at 15.6% year on year in June. Reflecting the political constraints on the ability of the central bank to tighten monetary policy further, the recent depreciation of the lira against the US dollar and rising global commodity prices, we forecast that inflation will average 12.7% this year. We expect inflation to decline gradually during the forecast period, reaching 8.1% at end-2022. There are significant upside risks to our revised forecast if the lira depreciates much more rapidly than we currently forecast.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
The lira lost 17% of its value against the US dollar in 2017. In 2018 we expect a further depreciation of 17%, owing to high levels of political uncertainty and decreasing confidence on the part of foreign investors. This pace of depreciation assumes a relatively benign political environment, a mild shift towards a more conservative economic stance, a gradual tightening of global monetary conditions and relatively tight domestic monetary conditions. Shocks to any of these assumptions, such as the broad global sell-off in emerging-market assets in April-July 2018 after a faster pick-up in nominal yields in the US, would lead to a more abrupt depreciation. In 2019-22 we expect the pace of depreciation against both the US dollar and the euro to slow in nominal terms. This will result in a mild appreciation in real terms after six consecutive years of real effective depreciations.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
Owing to particularly large trade deficits at the end of 2017 and in early 2018, the depreciation of the lira against the euro and the US dollar, and rising global commodity prices, we expect the current-account deficit to widen from 5.6% of GDP in 2017 to 6.7% of GDP this year. However, moderating capital inflows will keep the lira weak and interest rates relatively high, contributing to a slowdown in import demand and a consequent narrowing of the current-account deficit during the forecast period. Turkey's substantial external financing needs will be difficult to meet if global liquidity is constrained and investor confidence deteriorates further. We expect the rebound in tourist arrivals in 2017 to continue, but the sector will remain vulnerable to a possible resurgence of terrorist attacks.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The ruling centre-right Cambiemos coalition is under increasing political pressure amid recent currency volatility and an IMF bailout (the Fund is unpopular in Argentina), but will be hoping to get its policy agenda back on track in time for the presidential election in October 2019, when Mauricio Macri will seek a second term. However, the opposition will increasingly obstruct policy. Cambiemos lacks a congressional majority, meaning that the administration has to negotiate support for its legislative agenda on an ad hoc basis with various factions of Argentina's dominant Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party).
Currency depreciation pressure amid an emerging-market sell-off has introduced substantial political uncertainty, but major changes to economic policymaking are not envisaged under the terms of the IMF lending arrangement, other than a more rapid tightening of fiscal policy. The US$50bn stand-by arrangement, approved on June 20th, includes targets for a tightening of fiscal policy to produce a primary fiscal balance by 2020 (in order to contain growth in the public debt/GDP ratio and reduce inflationary deficit financing), and provisions for central-bank target independence to be enshrined in law, to help to tackle the inflation problem (the root of Argentina's external competitiveness problem, which is in turn driving devaluation pressures). The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that programme targets will be met, and will gradually reduce inflation and engender macro-economic stability over time.
A spike in interest rates and a tightening of fiscal policy amid currency pressures will weigh on economic activity; we have revised our forecast for real GDP growth in 2018 and now expect a full-year contraction of 0.3%. For now, our view of medium-term GDP growth remains broadly unchanged, although the risks to our forecasts have risen substantially. Under our benign baseline forecast, we expect growth to average 3.3% in 2020-22.
More front-loaded currency weakening than previously projected will provide some boost to external competitiveness, but even so, the current-account deficit will remain large in 2018, and import cover will dip from 7.6 months to around seven months this year. Thereafter, we expect the current-account deficit to narrow steadily, to below 3% of GDP in 2022.
Argentina's GDP per head is among the highest in the region and, combined with improved access to credit, moderate rates of economic growth in the medium term will boost purchasing power and create market opportunities. Still-high poverty rates and income inequality will restrict the pool of consumers, but to a lesser extent than in many other countries in the region.

Argentina's global business environment score improves in 2018-22, and the country jumps 12 places in the global ranking. Policy adjustment is underway as the government works to tighten macro-economic policy, reduce state intervention in the private sector and encourage private investment. But in many areas improvements will take time to materialise.
Country forecast overview: Argentina's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: The administration of Mauricio Macri works to address key weaknesses, including weak competition policy, the heavy burden of red tape and restrictive price controls.
2020-22: Continued work to build faith in legal and regulatory frameworks. State participation in key sectors continues.
Policy toward foreign investment
2018-19: Proactive, welcoming approach to foreign investment. Attempts to resolve outstanding disputes with creditors.
2020-22: Foreign direct investment is welcome. Improvement made in investment dispute settlement and availability of investment-protection schemes.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Continued efforts to improve the workings of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union) and develop closer relations with the Pacific Alliance, comprising Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.
2020-22: Possibility that new free-trade agreements are signed with the EU and Canada.
Taxes
2018-19: Further gradual reductions of export taxes to encourage domestic supply. Tax reforms to promote investment and reduce tax pressure.
2020-22: Comprehensive tax reform to improve federal-provincial revenue sharing a possibility, but obstacles to reform persist. System remains complex, despite recent reforms.
Financing
2018-19: Banking penetration remains weak and long-term credit restricted, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, owing to weak long-term deposit base.
2020-22: Non-bank financing grows, but is constrained by a relatively small pool of institutional investors.
The labour market
2018-19: Tension with unions, owing to inflation. Political and bargaining power of unions remains strong.
2020-22: Limited progress on labour reform. Continued potential for conflicts with unions. Some skills shortages.
Infrastructure
2018-19: The Macri administration continues to improve contract rights and deficient regulatory regimes.
2020-22: Some public and private investment set to improve energy supply and upgrade export infrastructure, but the risk of energy shortages will persist as demand grows.
Technological readiness
2018-19: Quality of e-commerce business environment is good. Upgrade of 4G capabilities.
2020-22: More progress on increasing scope of e-government as part of process to reduce red tape. Increase in research and development spending as percentage of GDP, but still relatively low compared with more developed markets.

Background: Democracy was restored to Argentina in 1983, after 50 years of instability and military regimes. Economic liberalisation in the 1990s drove firm growth, but an inflexible exchange-rate mechanism and fail-ure to deepen structural reform left the economy vulnerable to shocks, contributing to the collapse in 2001 of Fernando de la Rúa's centre-left government. An interim government took power until Néstor Kirchner of the Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party) began a term in 2003. He presided over an economic rebound, which enabled his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, to win the presidency in 2007 and secure re-election in 2011. Economic policy mismanage-ment drove a change of government in 2015, with a centre-right candidate, Mauricio Macri, taking office in December 2015.
Political structure: A strong presidential system is in theory checked by a bicameral Congress, comprising a 257-member Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and a 72-member Senate (the upper house); in practice, however, the presidency dominates. The presidential term is four years. There are 23 provinces and the Buenos Aires federal district, each with its own government.
Policy issues: Pro-cyclical expansionary policies and the commodity supercycle contributed to GDP growth of an annual average 6.6% in 2005-11. But expansionary policy also produced significant imbalances. Amid currency pressures, the Fernández government resorted to controls and ad hoc interventionism, to the detriment of the business environment. These policies did not reduce devaluation speculation and left the economy extremely vulnerable to currency crisis. Macroeconomic adjustments to try to reduce economic distortions are taking place under Mr Macri; these include the shift to a free float at the end of 2015, fiscal and monetary tightening, and reforms to boost domestic supply, but the pace of adjustment has been insufficient to prevent severe currency pressure, and in mid-2018 the government was forced to turn to the IMF for a stand-by lending arrangement involving tighter fiscal targets.
Taxation: The value-added tax (VAT) rate is 21%, although VAT on some goods and services is charged at a lower rate of 10.5%, and some services are taxed at a higher rate of 27%. Corporate income tax is levied at 35%, and personal income tax at progressive rates between 9% and 35%. Under a tax reform approved at end-2017, the corporate income tax rate will fall to 30% in 2019 and 25% in 2021. There is a 0.6% tax on financial transactions (deposits and withdrawals).
Foreign trade: The current account moved from surplus to deficit in 2010. By 2017 the deficit had widened to 4.9% of GDP.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
An economic downturn induced by a combination of severe drought and a collapse in confidence amid strong currency pressures earlier this year will weigh on the position of the president, Mauricio Macri. Argentina was hit hard by an emerging-market sell-off in May, and although turbulence in the foreign-exchange market has subsided since July with the announce-ment of a US$50bn IMF stand-by lending arrangement, recent developments could have lasting political consequences for the government. The Fund is supportive of Argentina, and The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect dramatic changes in the direction of economic policy, which is already geared towards macro-economic and microeconomic reforms to restore stability and promote more solid, stable economic growth (although the pace of macroeconomic policy adjustment will be faster). The problem for the president, Mauricio Macri, and his ruling centre-right Cambiemos coalition, is that the Fund has a very poor reputation in Argentina, reflecting its role before and after the country's deep economic crisis of 2001-02. Argentina's return to the Fund amid a fresh economic downturn will weigh on the government's approval ratings with little more than a year to go until the presidential election in October 2019.
The government will be hoping to get its policy agenda back on track in time for the election, when Mr Macri will seek a second term, but this will be challenging. Cambiemos lacks a congressional majority and has to negotiate legislative support on an ad hoc basis with various factions of the Partido Justicialista (PJ, the Peronist party). The PJ, which dominated politics for decades before Mr Macri's victory in 2015, is struggling to regroup from that defeat and is beset by internal divisions. The party is currently split between a left-wing, populist faction led by the former president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-15), and a centrist faction that as yet has no clear leader. So far, the PJ's divisions have worked in the government's favour, helping it to pursue its legislative agenda with the support of moderate Peronists.
But the political environment is changing, amid a renewed economic downturn and as the opposition begins manoeuvring for position ahead of the 2019 presidential election, and the government will struggle to push its agenda through before the election takes place. In the aftermath of its strong performance in the October 2017 mid-terms, the government moved quickly to pass reforms to the tax system, pensions and competition policy (in May it managed to pass capital market reforms). But in coming months, major reforms will be on hold, and opposition challenges to policy initiatives that are presented will increase. All this means that much-needed reforms to increase the flexibility of labour markets, improve the effective-ness of the judiciary, and enhance investor confidence in institutions and contract rights will be on the back burner. On our current assumption that Mr Macri wins a second term in 2019, we expect that improvements in these areas will start to yield results more clearly late on in our five-year forecast period.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
The next presidential election is due in October 2019. Notwithstanding Mr Macri's current difficulties, we continue to assume that he will win a second four-year term, based on our assumption of a recovery in GDP and a substantial reduction of inflation by then. There are large, and growing, risks to this forecast. Reflecting the difficulties faced by minority governments in Argentina, no non-Peronist party has been able to complete two consecutive terms in office since the 1920s. The emergence of a strong challenger from the Peronist party is therefore likely (although it is as yet unclear who this will be), and the election will be closely fought. The strongest Peronist challenge seems most likely to come from its moderate, pragmatist wing, given recent corruption allegations surrounding Ms Fernández and high-ranking officials in her govern-ment, who dominate the left-wing populist branch of the party. This may actually work against Mr Macri as, in a second-round vote, he would face a stiffer contest from a moderate pragmatist than from the populist wing of the party, which retains a loyal base of supporters but also has high rejection rates among the wider population.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
We expect relations with key international partners to remain strong under the Macri administration, which has worked hard to restore Argentina's international image since it came to office in 2015. The government is keen to seek trade deals under the auspices of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union).However, although Mercosur has reversed its protectionist tendencies, anti-globalisation sentiment has grown in the OECD. Mr Macri is continuing to seek support for an EU-Mercosur trade deal from his counterparts in Europe, and negotiations are continuing, although they are slow moving. In the meantime, Mercosur members including Argentina have pushed for free-trade negotiations elsewhere, including with Canada and China, and for closer relations with the Pacific Alliance, a free-trade area covering Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico. However, the window of opportunity for agreeing trade deals may be closing, depending on the results of Brazil's presidential election in October and with Argentina's own presidential election approaching next year.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Tighter financing conditions amid concerns over the large twin fiscal and current-account deficits, a spike in inflation following recent severe currency depreciation pressures, and a steep fall in economic activity amid weak confidence and severe drought have introduced substantial political uncertainty. However, major changes to economic policymaking are not envisaged under the terms of the three-year, US$50bn IMF stand-by arrangement (SBA), other than a more rapid tightening of fiscal policy. The govern-ment has made progress since it came to office at the end of 2015 and began grappling with the task of restoring macroeconomic stability while improving conditions for business. But macroeconomic adjustment is clearly incomplete, with inflation and the federal government deficit both extremely high.
Still-high inflation has contributed to currency overvaluation, which has in turn produced a large and growing current-account deficit. These imbalances contributed to the sharp peso adjustment of April-June, and to the government's decision to seek an IMF lending deal to restore market confidence. The SBA was approved on June 20th and an initial disbursement of US$15bn was released immediately for deficit financing and to help to restore reserves coverage ratios. The deal includes targets for a tightening of fiscal policy to produce a primary fiscal balance by 2020 (in order to contain growth in the public debt/GDP ratio and reduce inflationary deficit financing), and provisions for central-bank target independence to be enshrined in law, to help to tackle the inflation problem (the root of Argentina's external competitiveness problem, which is in turn driving devaluation pressures).
We expect that programme targets will, on the whole, be met, and will gradually reduce inflation and engender macro-economic stability over time. This will have positive implications for the external sector and growth. The biggest risks to this outlook are political, and reflect the possibility that voter (as well as business) confidence in the Macri admin-istration and the economic outlook will feed into further market volatility and a deep recession. This would not only complicate the adjustment process, but also threaten our assumption that Mr Macri will secure a second term in power, raising questions as to the future direction of economic policy under a new government.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
In its first two years of office the government pursued gradual fiscal tightening (so as not to thwart economic growth), but, in the face of market pressure, it has now accelerated the pace of adjustment under the auspices of the IMF deal. The fiscal targets set out in the deal were broadly in line with our expectations and allow for a relatively gradual adjustment, partly reflecting provisions that allow for increased social safety net expenditure. For 2018 the primary federal government deficit target is 2.7% of GDP, for 2019 it is 1.3% of GDP, and for 2020 the government is targeting primary fiscal balance. Our own forecasts assume that these targets will be met, except in 2019, when we expect an additional 0.2 percentage points in spending under provisions of the IMF deal allowing for increased social safety net spending in the event of a rise in the poverty rate.
Bearing in mind that the government beat its fiscal target in the first half of 2018 by a substantial margin, the 2018 target should be achievable, although it will require cuts to planned capital spending, which will have a knock-on impact on economic growth. Apart from capital spending, primary spending restraint this year and in the rest of the forecast period will come via a phasing out of costly energy subsidies and the recent approval of a social security reform that will produce substantial savings (0.4% of GDP per year from 2018). The biggest risks to meeting the fiscal target centre on the government's ability to maintain public-sector wage restraint amid above-target inflation and strong public-sector union power, as well as below-target revenue, reflecting a sharp deceleration of economic activity this year.
The government is-for now at least-facing a problem with liquidity rather than solvency. We assume that, despite this liquidity problem, deficit financing will not prove problematic, owing to the IMF deal, and also assuming that market access improves from around 2019. That said, the public debt/GDP ratio is likely to continue to rise in 2018 to well over 60% of GDP, before stabilising in the remainder of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
Having tightened monetary policy sharply to help to stem currency pressures, the Banco Central de la República Argentina (BCRA, the central bank) will unwind its rate rises only very slowly. Further currency depreciation is possible in the short term, and further rate rises remain a risk, but for now we expect rates to stay on hold, at 40%. Tight monetary policy is having an impact, as is evident in the sharp deceleration of growth in the monetary aggregates (which the bank has recently begun monitoring more closely as a complement to the policy rate), and we expect the central bank to begin to unwind its dramatic rate rise over the next few months. This process will be complicated, however, by weak confidence in the nascent inflation-targeting regime, which means that inflation expectations are not well anchored and pass-through from currency depreciation into consumer prices is high. We do still expect monthly inflation to start to ease late in 2018, once the effects of currency depreciation and tariff adjustment start to fade. This should allow for gradual monetary easing, beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing for an extended period thereafter, providing for moderately positive real interest rates in the medium term.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Reflecting data for May-June, which show that a steep decline in agriculture production amid a severe drought has given way to a more broad-based contraction in output, we have made a further downward revision to our GDP forecast for 2018, and now expect a technical recession to result in a contraction in full-year growth of 0.3% in 2018. This forecast represents a dramatic change from the start of the year, when market expectations were for growth of over 3%, and demonstrates that Argentina's economic output is not yet sufficiently diversified to withstand the impact of drought on the important agricultural sector (agriculture accounts for a fairly hefty 11% of GDP, and agro-industry is also important to the economy). But on top of drought, output is being hit by tighter macroeconomic policy and the jolt to confidence following currency turmoil and the IMF bail-out.
Our forecasts currently assume that activity will fall in seasonally adjusted sequential terms in both the second and third quarter, before a recovery gathers steam in the fourth quarter. Assuming that a return to normal harvest levels next year, (as well as a restoration of confidence as disinflation begins), we expect GDP growth to reach 2.2% in 2019. For both 2018 and 2019 there is an unusually high degree of uncertainty attached to our forecasts. There is, on the one hand, a not-insubstantial risk that policy tightening on top of drought could tip Argentina into a deeper recession. But, on the other hand, activity could rebound slightly more quickly than we currently have pencilled into our forecasts if real currency adjustment proves a more rapid-than-expected spur to export manufacturing activity.
For now our forecasts for the second part of the forecast period (2020-22) are unchanged, although the risks to these forecasts have risen substantially. Under our benign baseline forecast, we expect growth to average 3.3% in 2020-22, coming in below 3% in 2020 amid moderately weaker growth in the US and China in those years, before accelerating above 3% in 2021-22. This projected acceleration in 2021-22 rests on the assumption that that implementation of recently passed and ongoing structural reforms will gradually boost economic activity. There is increasing downside risk to this assumption, in the form of a weakening of consumer and business confidence, and the potential for a much more tense presidential election period in 2019.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
The reduction of inflation will continue to be complicated in the short term by further gradual increases in utilities tariffs as these are brought closer in line with market prices. On top of this, rapid recent peso depreciation, in a context of unanchored inflation expectations, will produce substantial pass-through effects, keeping inflation high in the short term. However, assuming that macroeconomic policy remains tight under the auspices of the IMF deal, domestic demand remains subdued, and domestic supply strengthens on the back of an improved regulatory environment for agricultural and other producers, we continue to expect gradual disinflation in the medium term. It will take quite some time, however, for inflation to fall to single-digit levels. According to our baseline forecast, this will not happen until early 2021.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
The peso was badly hit in the second quarter of 2018 as investors that had previously given the administration the benefit of the doubt over its ability to reverse macroeconomic imbalances zeroed in on the country's large fiscal and current-account deficits. The latter reflects clear overvaluation of the peso, a problem that worsened last year as huge inflows of portfolio capital produced real currency appreciation. As a result, at end-2017 the real effective exchange rate was 14% stronger than the average of the previous 20 years. Recent currency adjustment will go some way to reversing this trend, assuming that disinflation occurs as expected from late 2018 (so that inflation does not eat away at recent competitiveness gains), although there are substantial risks to this assumption. Under our baseline forecast we expect the peso to continue to depreciate in both nominal and real terms, to address the problem of currency overvaluation, taking the exchange rate to Ps29.85:US$1 at end-2018 and Ps39.9:US$1 at end-2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
More front-loaded currency weakening than previously projected will provide some boost to external competitiveness, but even so, in 2018 the current-account deficit will remain large as a percentage of GDP, with the boost to net exports of goods and services becoming more evident from 2019. Even in 2022 we expect the current-account deficit to remain substantial (although more manageable), at 2.7% of GDP. After a period of huge inflows of portfolio capital in 2016-17, access to finance will be scarcer and more costly in 2018-19; meanwhile, inflows of foreign direct investment will average an unspectacular 2.1% of GDP in 2018-22. This introduces risks to our assumption that import cover will improve gradually over the medium term, although inflows of IMF credit will be supportive of reserves.

Full text: Chile--highlights: Political outlook
Sebastián Piñera of the centre-right Chile Vamos (CV) coalition won the presidential election in late 2017 and took office in March. However, a change in the electoral process led to a more proportional system that challenged the traditional domination of centre-left and centre-right coalitions; as a result, no coalition currently holds a majority in either house of Congress. This will make policymaking difficult, and means that the legislative agenda will move more slowly and be kept broadly centrist, in order to attract the necessary votes. Government effectiveness will remain the best in the region, owing to competent officials and cross-party support for pro-market policies. The country will rank highly in measures of stability and rule of law.

Chile remains top in Latin America in our business environment ranking in the forecast period. Its strengths include a longstanding, well-functioning market economy, an open foreign investment regime, a strong fiscal position, and deep and sophisticated capital markets. The country will remain at the forefront of regional and Pacific Rim integration efforts, underpinning the free-trade framework. Improvements to education and infrastructure, including renewable energy supply, will come online during the forecast period, further supporting the environment for business.

Annual growth will average 3.2% in 2018-22. Although a marked acceleration from the previous five-year period, this is still relatively tepid compared with Chile's growth rates in the 1990s and during the commodities supercycle. Faster growth owes to a recovery in copper prices and investment, and will be supported by Chile's productive capacity, relatively good infrastructure, and prized political and institutional stability. The current account will remain in deficit, despite a growing trade surplus, owing to higher debt repayments and profit repatriation by multinational firms, but it will remain manageable. Deficits will be financed through capital inflows, particularly foreign direct investment.
Chile--highlights: Demographic outlook

Working-age population growth   0.9 0.5
Labour force growth   1.5 1.2
At an estimated 18.1m in 2017, Chile's small population is growing at a slower rate than those of most of its neighbours. Population growth has largely followed global trends towards the lower birth rates of more affluent societies. The birth rate has fallen steadily in the past decade or so, from 16.4 per 1,000 people in 2002-07 to 13.9 per 1,000 in 2013-17, and is forecast to slow further, to 13.1 per 1000 in 2018-22. Chile also has an older demographic profile than most regional countries, with those aged 65 and over accounting for over 10% of the total population, and set to rise to 13% by 2022. The labour force is forecast to grow at an annual average of 1.2% in the forecast period. Health indicators are broadly comparable with other OECD economies.
Chile--highlights: Market opportunities

Household consumption per head (US$) 9,560 10,260 10,580 11,620 12,670 13,590
Ample government infrastructure concessions and expansion in the renewables sector will provide opportunities. But Chile's market opportunities are constrained by the country's small population. However, persistently high wages, combined with political stability and effective economic management, will continue to attract investment. Rising household consumption from 2018, bolstered by high employment, real wage gains and low inflation, will lift consumer expenditure. High income inequality will gradually recede.
Chile--highlights: Long-term outlook

Growth of real GDP per head 2.6 2.1 2.3
Growth of real GDP 3.2 2.4 2.7
Labour productivity growth 2.6 2.7 2.7
Broad consensus in favour of orthodox monetary and fiscal policies will underpin steady long-term economic growth, but this will come under some challenge from new left-wing political parties. Free-trade agreements, both signed within and outside the region, will help Chile to attract foreign investment and further diversify the economy. Average annual GDP growth is forecast to reach 3.2% in 2018-30, moderating to 2.4% in 2031-50. The capital stock will continue to grow and investment will rise to over 25% of GDP. However, as growth in the working-age population slows, so will the increase in labour supply, causing economic growth to become more dependent on productivity gains.

Background: In 1988 the military ruler, Augusto Pinochet, lost a referendum to allow him to stay in office. The centre-left Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia coalition (now Nueva Mayoría-NM) won the December 1989 general election and the next four presidential elections. A realignment of forces helped the centre-right to win the 2010 election. Michelle Bachelet of the NM, who was president in 2006-10, won the 2013 election and took office for a new four-year term in March 2014. A centre-right president, Sebastián Piñera, took office for his second term on March 11th 2018 (his first was in 2010-14).
Political structure: The political system is presidential, with a bicameral legislature that comprises a 43-seat Senate (the upper house) and a 155-seat Chamber of Deputies (the lower house). The presidential term is four years, and consecutive re-election is not permitted. This structure may be subject to change-possibly towards a more prime-ministerial model-as part of ongoing constitutional reform. The judiciary is independent, but the executive exerts some influence through the nomination of temporary judges and the control of promotions to the Supreme Court. Monetary policy is in the hands of the autonomous Banco Central de Chile (the central bank). Chile has 15 regions, 54 provinces and 346 municipalities.
Policy issues: The two major coalitions remain in broad consensus on preserving a liberal market economy and maintaining an orthodox monetary and fiscal policy framework. However, a new left-wing coalition (the third-largest force in Congress) has demanded more social spending. A new proportional electoral system will see issues such as regional devolution and a conflict involving the Mapuche indigenous people rise up the political agenda as politics becomes more fragmented.
Taxation: Corporate income tax is assessed at two stages. Declared profit is subject to a 27% first-category tax (FCIT). When profit is distributed to shareholders or partners, a 35% second-category tax applies, minus a credit for FCIT. Tax rate on dividends and interest payments to non-banks is 35%. Royalties and fees transferred abroad are subject to a 30-35% withholding tax. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at 19%.
Foreign trade: The general import tariff rate is 6%, but the trade-weighted effective average rate is below 2%, owing to preferences granted through trade accords. Exports in 2017 were worth an estimated US$69.2bn; imports stood at US$61.3bn.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
Present government: Sebastián Piñera of the centre-right Chile Vamos (CV) coalition, who was previously president in 2010-14, won the December 2017 presidential runoff and took office for a new four-year term on March 11th 2018. CV is chiefly composed of the conservative Unión Demócrata Independiente, and the centre-right Renovación Nacional (Mr Piñera's party), but also includes the smaller Evolución Política (Evópoli). No party holds a majority in either house of Congress following last year's election, but CV holds the largest number of seats in both chambers. The opposition includes the centre-left Nueva Mayoría (NM) coalition, which led the previous government (2014-18), and under a previous configuration, called the Concertación, governed Chile from 1990 to 2010. After the last election, the left-wing Frente Amplio has emerged as the third-largest force in Congress. The centrist Democracia Cristiana (DC) broke from NM in April 2018, and currently forms the fourth-largest bloc in the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and third-largest in the Senate (the upper house). Independent parties, largely leaning centre-left, also form a presence.
CV holds 19 of 43 seats in the Senate and 72 of 155 in the Chamber of Deputies. It will need to rely on votes from other coalitions or dissident members of the opposition to pass legislation. The most likely votes are to come from DC, but support is only likely to come on an ad hoc basis, as DC has ruled out an alliance with CV and declared itself firmly of the left. Nevertheless, the necessity to get opposition parties and coalitions on board will keep policymaking broadly centrist.

Political outlook: Political stability
Since taking office in March Mr Piñera has maintained relatively strong levels of public support, with an approval rating of 52% in June, according to Adimark, a local pollster. The government's agenda has so far moved slowly, but plans for Mr Piñera's four-year term, which will end in 2022, include expected revisions to a 2014 tax reform (although a reduction in corporate tax has been aband-oned in order to fund increases on social spending), as well as reforms to the pension system, which has been the cause of several public protests in recent years.
Reforms are likely to follow a broadly centrist path, as a more right-leaning agenda would face challenges, given a more fractured legislature after the 2017 general election. A change in the election process has led to a more propor-tional system that ends the traditional domination by centre-left and centre-right coalitions; as a result, no coalition presently holds a majority in either the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) or the Senate (the upper house).
The centre-left opposition has been in disarray since last year's electoral defeat, with no clear consensus among the parties on how to approach Mr Piñera's government. Left-wing elements have vowed to oppose the administration, while those in the centre have flirted with being more co-operative. In April this led the centrist DC to split from the centre-left NM to form its own bloc. Votes from DC, which holds 14 of 155 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and six of 43 in the Senate, could help the government to form a majority in both houses of Congress, (CV holds 72 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 19 in the Senate). However, support from DC is likely to come only on an ad hoc basis. As a result, the legislative agenda should move more slowly than in the past, as policy differences between the coalitions will become more apparent after decades of relative policy consensus. The risk of political gridlock will be higher later in Mr Piñera's term, should his popularity or the country's economic performance unexpectedly stumble.
Mr Piñera's planned reform of Chile's outdated immigration system, announced in April, should stem the flow of immigrants (largely from Haiti and Venezuela), and curb rising anti-immigrant sentiment around perceptions of crime and strains on public services; annual flows of immigrants have doubled since 2014. A rise in petty crime (although overall crime rates remain among the region's lowest) will continue to be a cause of concern.
Mr Piñera's platform included a more progressive stance on indigenous rights, including constitutional recognition for the Mapuche (Chile's largest indigenous group), which should gain cross-coalition support. This should help to ease a slow-burning conflict in Chile's southern regions. Social protests will continue, especially concerning education and the pension system, but The Economist Intelligence Unit does not believe that these will reach the same level as in Mr Piñera's last term in office (2010-14), as the government has so far taken a more conciliatory approach.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
Chile's system of government is considered the most effective and technically adept in Latin America, thanks in part to a high degree of political stability and a highly professional bureaucracy. This is unlikely to change substantively in the forecast period, but there are several risks to political effectiveness. Corruption in Chile remains low, even compared with OECD standards-it is the 26th least corrupt country in the world, according to the 2017 Corruption Perceptions Index prepared by Transparency International, a global anti-corruption watchdog. Nevertheless, recent years have seen several prominent scandals in both the public and private sectors, which have fuelled a sense of impunity for elites. Still, the scale of wrongdoing is not equivalent to current scandals in other countries in the region, and public prosecutors have so far proved energetic in bringing a number of perpetrators to account.
Moreover, since the peaceful transition to democracy in 1990, successive administrations have operated with a broad consensus around maintaining the open and liberal economic model instituted by the military regime of Augusto Pinochet, while also strengthening democratic institutions. Since 1990 this meant domination by the two centre-left and centre-right coalitions. However, the last election under new electoral rules resulted in a more fractured legislature, returning Chile to its pre-dictatorship political landscapes of coalitions of the right, left and centre. Although this should slow policymaking, it will also have the effect of promoting consensus (in order to pass legislation) and will keep policymaking broadly centrist. Nevertheless, political engagement and turnout remain low, posing a challenge to long-term confidence in the system. Efforts to promote regional government and divest power to the regions (Chile is highly centralised) could also increase the quality of government. Given that no coalition holds a majority (a situation that is likely to continue in future governments) dramatic policy shifts are unlikely. Bills to change organic constitutional provisions require a four-sevenths majority, while bills re-interpreting or modifying the constitution respectively require either a three-fifths or two-thirds majority.
A civil service reform in 2003 helped to increase meritocracy by reducing the amount of political appointees at the head of government agencies and departments by over four-fifths, and making civil servants accountable to an independent directorate. This has also helped to reduce fraudulent use of public funds, which, although relatively minor in comparison with most other countries in the region, had become a problem under some governments. Official transparency and efficiency has also been fostered by the centralisation of the procurement tenders of all government departments and public-sector agencies in a single online platform.
Chile's judicial system is relatively efficient and transparent. The criminal justice system was modernised over a period of six years, following reforms in 1999 that created an office of public prosecutions and established a legal aid service, as well as a new code for penal procedures. Chile ranks highly in most measures of rule of law, protection of private property and overall institutional effectiveness.
Political outlook: Election watch
Presidential and legislative elections were last held in late 2017. The next national elections will be regional and municipal elections in October 2020. The next presidential and legislative elections will take place in late 2021. Although it is too early to say who will win the next presidential election, there has been alternation between the left and right since 2010. Consecutive re-election is prohibited.
Political outlook: International relations
Chile will maintain generally solid relations with the US and other Latin American countries in 2018-22. Under the framework of the Pacific Alliance, an integration project that also includes Peru, Colombia and Mexico, Chile will continue to support regional integration efforts, and seek to improve ties with Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union, whose members are Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) and Asia-Pacific economies. Chile will also support the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the successor agreement to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, made following the withdrawal of the US. The CPTPP was signed by its 11 members in Chile in March; we expect Chile to ratify the deal this year, and for the agreement to come into force in 2019. Ties with China will also continue to deepen, given ongoing trade and investment flows. Relations with neigh-bouring Bolivia will remain complicated, owing to ongoing border disputes and Bolivia's demand for the return of sovereign access to the Pacific coast; deliberations resumed at the International Court of Justice in The Hague in March. Lack of full diplomatic relations (as has been the case since 1978) will lead to the occasional eruption of diplomatic rows.

A liberal regulatory framework will support the investment climate.
Chile's investment climate will remain the most attractive in Latin America in 2018-22 according to The Economist Intelligence Unit's Business Environment Rankings, which compare the quality and attractiveness of investment conditions in 82 of the world's largest economies. Chile ranks first in the region and 20th globally in the 2018-22 forecast period, boosted by its longstanding and well-functioning market economy, open investment regime, strong fiscal position, sophisticated capital markets, and large network of free-trade agreements (FTAs). Its macroeconomic environment ranking improves globally and the country maintains its first place ranking regionally in the forecast period, as GDP growth will begin to pick up after the slowdown of recent years. The score for foreign trade and exchange controls remains unchanged, as does that for taxes, although Chile falls slightly in the global ranking in both categories owing to improvements elsewhere. Both the score and global ranking for infrastructure improve in the forecast period, as do the score for financing, and the score and regional and global ranking for the labour market, driven by ongoing education reform to improve access and quality. The labour market will also experience some improvements as the government seeks to address the rigidity of a recent labour reform. The score and global ranking for political stability improves slightly, but the country falls to second place regionally.
In terms of market opportunities, Chile's GDP per head is the highest among major Latin American countries, at an estimated US$15,341 in 2017. It is forecast to reach US$21,657 in 2022, and to exceed US$25,000 by 2025-a figure generally regarded as separating developed from middle-income countries. Structurally, Chile's business environment ranking suffers from the modest size of its domestic market, but this is mitigated by the country's large network of FTAs, which expand its potential market and enable more than 90% of its trade to be conducted on a preferential basis.

Fiscal prudence and low levels of debt support macroeconomic stability
Chile's global rank for its macroeconomic environment improves in the forecast period, moving Chile into the top ten in our global ranking for this category; the country also maintains its position as the most stable and resilient economy in Latin America. The country retains the top regional spot despite relatively soft economic growth. (we forecast that real GDP will expand by an average of 3.2% in 2018-22, substantially lower than the average of 5.3% in 2010-13, a period of high commodity prices.) The government has promised to bring down the fiscal deficit during its term, which coincides with the forecast period, by 0.2% per year starting in 2018, which is in line with the prudent economic management of the past four decades. We expected that the fiscal deficit will average 1.4% of GDP during the forecast period. Chile's macroeconomic environment will be supported by a solid institutional framework and a general consensus favouring orthodox fiscal and monetary policies, free markets, and integration in the world economy.
Generally prudent fiscal management has allowed the government to maintain very low levels of public debt (24.5% of GDP in 2017). Although the deficit has seen a steady rise since 2007 (when it was 3.9% of GDP) and is expected to rise further, to a high of 27.6% of GDP by 2020, this is a manageable level and by far the lowest in the region. Macroeconomic stability has traditionally been supported by Chile's system of cyclically adjusted fiscal accounts (under a structural fiscal rule adopted in 2001), which has required that it save part of the fiscal proceeds derived during periods of unusually high copper prices and/or GDP growth rates in two sovereign wealth funds. These funds, which held combined assets of US$24.5bn in June 2018 (around 8% of forecast 2018 GDP), serve to cushion the country from volatility in copper prices and the risk of natural disasters by allowing it to implement countercyclical fiscal policies with limited negative impact on the local economy. However, a consistent overestimation of long-term copper prices and GDP growth has led to some deterioration in the fiscal accounts in recent years.
The Banco Central de Chile (BCCh, the central bank) has been independent for more than two decades, and its autonomy is unlikely to come under threat in the forecast period. It is a widely respected institution owing to the success of its inflation-targeting regime, which has held average annual inflation within the BCCh's target range of 2-4% per year in most years since its full implementation in 1999. Inflation has generally remained at the lower end of the range in recent years, and stood at 2.5% in the 12 months to June.
The BCCh is complemented by an efficient banking supervisory body, the Superintendencia de Bancos e Instituciones Financieras, which has helped to maintain a modern and well-capitalised banking sector that remains vigorous and profitable, and has proved resilient to external shocks such as the 2009 global financial crisis. The securities and insurance regulator, the Comisión del Mercado Financiero, and the pensions supervisor, the Superintendencia de Pensiones, are also part of the regulatory landscape.
Chile also has an independent Consejo Fiscal Asesor (CFA, fiscal council), created in 2013, which helps to increase transparency in the public finances. The CFA publicly evaluates both fiscal performance, and official projections and plans, and generates its own macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts. In June the government introduced a bill to Congress that seeks to grant political and operational autonomy to the CFA (renaming it the Consejo Fiscal Autónomo).

Chile will remain the regional leader in policy toward private enterprise
Decades of consistent market-friendly policy and reforms keep Chile in the top position in Latin America and in ninth place in our global rankings for policy towards private enterprise and competition. Following various privatisation programmes-mostly in the late 1980s under the military regime of Augusto Pinochet (1973-90)-Chile has only a small number of companies left in state hands, most notably Codelco, the world's largest copper producer. Governments on both the right and left of the political spectrum have pursued market-oriented solutions to economic problems. In recent years red tape has been significantly reduced-for instance, a company can now be created online in a single day and without cost. Similarly, Chile's bankruptcy legislation was modernised with the passage of a new law that came into force in October 2014. According to the World Bank's Doing Business 2018 report, Chile ranked 55th out of 190 nations in terms of the cost of regulations for conducting business in 2017. It is second best in Latin America after Mexico (49th).
Following a period of strained relations between the business community and the former president, Michelle Bachelet, the return of Mr Piñera to the presidency has been largely welcomed by the private sector, given his economic track record during his first term in office (2010-14), as well as his campaign promise to adopt more pro-market policies, including a simplification of the tax rules, modernisation of the environmental evaluation system to speed up the permitting process and a reduction of red tape. We expect progress on these fronts during Mr Piñera's current four-year term; a reform to the environmental evaluation system was presented in August.
In an effort to reduce red tape, in May the government has announced the creation of an office to accompany domestic and foreign investors during the permitting process. The Oficina de Grandes Proyectos Sustentables (GPS), seeks to act as the one-stop shop for investors. The Ministry of Economy, where the GPS office is located, estimates that 203 invest-ment projects across all sectors, worth US$65bn, could materialise in the next four years. The government also instructed the ministry to identify other investment bottlenecks. Other measures to ease investment included allowing the ministry to issue temporary permits, and also to update the registry or mining concessions in the country.

Chile's foreign investment regime is the third-ranked in the world and the top-ranked in Latin America for 2018-22. Policy is open and pro-business, based on a constitutionally guaranteed principle of non-discrimination between local and foreign investors. The country attracted a total of US$6.4bn in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in 2017, compared with US$12.4bn in 2016, due to a combination of declining geological conditions (ore grades), tense industrial relations and higher labour costs, which led to stagnation in new mining projects, according to the UN Conference on Trade and Development. The country was the sixth-largest FDI recipient in Latin America (after Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and Peru). Figures from the first quarter show that the country attracted US$6.9bn in FDI, more than for full-year 2017.
Chile will remain the world's top destination for copper mining investment. The Comisión Nacional del Cobre (Cochilco, the state copper commission) has previously indicated that mining investment will exceed US$64.9bn in 2017-26, attracted by the country's vast mineral wealth, close proximity to coastal ports and reputation for political and economic stability. A rebound in metal prices (demand for some key commodities like copper and lithium is expected to increase in the forecast period), paired with more pro-market policies put forward by the current administration, is likely to push investment higher. We forecast FDI of US$17.5bn per year on average in 2018-22.
InvestChile shifts its focus to attract all kinds of investment
Unlike the previous administration, which adopted sector-specific policies to attract foreign investment-focusing on the mining, energy, food and tourism industries-the Piñera government has announced a non-discriminatory, multi-sectoral approach. The economy minister, José Ramón Valente, has said that the government investment promotion agency, InvestChile, will not just focus on attracting FDI or on greenfield projects, but will also promote foreign investment in the acquisition of local companies to develop local industry, working closely with the recently created GPS office.

Chile has more FTAs than any other country globally
Chile's trade regime is among the most open in the world, although rapid trade liberalisation elsewhere in the world means that the country's global rank slips from 27th to 32nd in the forecast period. The country has a low trade-weighted average effective import tariff rate as a result of its large network of FTAs and various economic association agreements. These total 26 agreements and involve more than 64 countries, which account for over 86% of global GDP and more than 64% of the global population. The most important are FTAs signed with the EU (February 2003), the US (January 2004), China (October 2006) and Japan (August 2007). Chile also has FTAs with South Korea, Malaysia, Turkey, the European Free-Trade Association (consisting of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), Canada, Central America, Australia, Vietnam, Hong Kong and Mexico. Chile is also a member of the dynamic Pacific Alliance free-trade bloc, together with Mexico, Colombia and Peru, and has more limited agreements with India, New Zealand, Singapore and Brunei. These agreements offer firms based in Chile a potential market of over 4bn people, as 94% of Chile's trade is conducted on a preferential basis. Furthermore, Chile offers an unusually narrow range of import tariff dispersion, ranging from 0% to 6%. The country has no exchange restrictions affecting capital or trade flows, but there are reporting formalities with respect to foreign investment exceeding US$10,000.
Chile is currently negotiating the modernisation of its FTA with the EU, as well as the deepening of its FTA with South Korea. It is also negotiating a bilateral commercial agreement with Brazil, and, together with its partners in the Pacific Alliance, is negotiating an accord to strengthen economic and commercial relations with the Alliance's associate countries, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Singapore. Its most recently agreed FTA was made with Uruguay in October 2016 (it has not yet been signed into law). Chile also recently modernised its FTA with Canada to include a new chapter on investments, as well as a deepening of its FTA with China, a commercial agreement with Indonesia, a public procurement agreement with Brazil and a commercial liberalisation agreement with Argentina.
With the failure of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) following the decision of the US president, Donald Trump, to pull the US from the deal, Chile and the ten other remaining countries signed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in March; we expect it to enter into force in the coming months.

Chile's score for tax policy remains unchanged in the forecast period, but progress elsewhere causes it to slide to 17th place globally in the ranking, although the country maintains in first place in the region. Total taxes remain relatively low on a global comparison, but, according to the Doing Business 2018 report, the time it takes to file taxes in Chile is 291 hours a year, compared with an OECD high-income average of 160.7; Chile ranks 72nd of 190 countries in the category for paying taxes. The tax regime underwent major change in 2014, following passage of a tax reform that was signed into law in September that year. The reform was designed to raise fiscal revenue by US$8.2bn annually by the end of Ms Bachelet's term, to fund reforms to the education system and improvements to healthcare. Although the backbone of the reform was an increase in corporate taxes, it created a dual taxation system that, for many in the private sector, was too complicated to fully implement. As a result, the government signed into law a "reform to the reform" in February 2016 that left only one system in place, the so-called semi-integrated system, in which companies pay a 27% corporate tax rate, and shareholders also pay income tax, but with businesses permitted to deduct some earnings if these are reinvested. The second mechanism of the original system, which establishes a corporate tax rate of 25%, along with a 10% income-tax levy on shareholders, remains an option for family-run and small businesses.
The government is seeking to simplify the current tax system
During his 2017 presidential campaign, Mr Piñera promised that he would lower the corporate tax rate from 27% to 25%, the average of its OECD peers. However, on June 1st Mr Piñera backtracked and said that the government would leave the corporate tax rate at current levels, citing the weaker economy and the need to raise additional revenue to fund social programmes and other fiscal needs. The government has announced its intention to meet its other promise, to simplify the tax system, in a bill expected to be introduced to Congress by September at the latest, which is likely to include additional levies, including a tax on digital platforms, and, possibly, increased taxes on sugary and alcoholic drinks, or taxes on foods with high contents of calories, sugar, sodium and fat.
Following close to two years of massive protests against the country's private pension providers, the movement has lost some of its momentum. The government has announced plans to address the core of the problem, low pension payments (the majority are below the minimum wage, which is currently around US$420/month), with a bill to be introduced to Congress in the second half of 2018. Although the details are yet to be unveiled, the reform is likely to include provisions to strengthen the contributions provided by the government to the most vulnerable members of the population (the elderly, women and the middle class), and to increase employee contributions to 14% from the current 10%, to be paid entirely by the employer.

The financial sector is well developed, with a solid institutional framework
Chile remains the leader in Latin America in terms of financing and remains in seventh place in the global rankings in 2018-22. Its capital market is sophisticated, and has been growing in terms of liquidity and market capitalisation, helped by a solid institutional and legal framework. This has involved rapid adoption of new financial instruments, the appearance of new intermediaries and payment systems, and a continued updating of rules, regulations and methods of official supervision. Despite Chile's small population (just 18.1m) and annual GDP per head (an estimated US$15,431 in 2017), stockmarket capitalisation was large at the end of 2017, at US$298bn (US$273bn at the end of June 2018), up from US$218bn a year earlier. The country's privately run pension funds (AFPs) are by far the main players on the demand side. By end-June 2018 they were managing a total of US$202bn, of which US$114bn was invested in Chile (US$92.7bn in fixed-income and US$21.8bn in variable-income securities). The 55 insurance companies operating in the country are also substantial investors, with a combined portfolio of around US$64.2bn at end-2017, as are over 500 mutual funds, which managed around US$60.5bn at end-May. There are also more than 100 publicly traded investment funds, managing a combined total of US$22.9bn as at end-2017.
Chilean companies with solid credit ratings will continue to have good access to long-term finance through credits and leasing, and large companies will retain access to a variety of other options, such as stock and bond issues, as well as a competitive and flexible syndicated loan market for maturities of up to ten years. Blue-chip businesses will have access to long-term funding locally-through bank loans with maturities of up to seven years, or local bond issues with maturities of up to 30 years-owing to the use of an inflation-indexed unit of account, the unidad de fomento, which eliminates inflation risk.
Recent downgrades of the long-term foreign currency rating by the major ratings agencies have not had a larger impact on the borrowing costs of companies, suggesting that such downgrades were largely priced in. The government has said that its goal is to regain its previous rating by the end of its term in 2022.
Chile has a relatively high stock of external debt, particularly by the corporate sector, which increased by 20% between 2007 and 2014 as local companies took advantage of low international interest rates to finance regional expansion. According to the BCCh, external debt due in the next 12 months was US$37.7bn at the end of the first quarter, compared with foreign reserves that month of US$38.1bn. This leaves the country vulnerable to a financial shock. Nevertheless, BCCh data also suggest that only a small proportion of corporates' foreign debt is not covered either by foreign currency earnings or foreign currency hedging operations, which should mitigate risk.

Chile performs somewhat less well in the labour market category compared with other elements of the business environment ranking. Its score and ranking improves in 2018-22 owing to education reforms, which we anticipate will increase the supply of educated and skilled workers in the forecast period, pushing Chile to 25th place globally and first place in the region. These were begun under the Bachelet government (2014-18) to address long-running deficiencies in the country's education system, which although better than that of neighbouring countries, lags behind that of the developing Asia region and the other countries in the OECD (of which Chile is a member). The reform expands access to pre-school, university and technical education, and over the coming years will see 15 new career and technical education centres opened across the country (one in each region) for vocational education. Nonetheless, businesses have long complained that the labour regime is too rigid. It offers strong worker protections through both restrictive regulations and high firing costs (one month's wage per year worked in the company).
Labour reform is in its early stages of implementation
A labour reform approved in 2017 strengthened unions, as it expanded the categories of workers who can join a union, established a floor for negotiations (not permitting a company to offer workers weaker benefits than they had previously) and prohibits the replacement of striking workers. It also prohibits companies from extending benefits to non-union members. So far, the impact of the reform has been muted (only 9% of Chilean workers belong to a union, although the level is higher in the mining sector). The government has said that it expects to introduce a bill to congress to address some of these issues, including the issue of replacement during strikes, which should be more business friendly. It is yet to announce a date or the specific contents of the bill.
The Piñera administration has announced its intention to keep a focus on vocational training. It sent a bill to Congress in May proposing to provide free tuition to 70% of poorer students that attend technical universities. It is estimated that 167,000 students could benefit from passage of the bill, at an annual cost of US$475m. The government has said that its goal is for 90% of students in vocational and technical centres to receive free tuition, contingent on economic growth and the state of the public finances.

Chile retains first place in the regional ranking for infrastructure in the forecast period and climbs to 26th in the global ranking. The country's telecommuni-cations and technological infrastructure is modern, particularly by regional standards, as the regulatory system for telecoms encourages competition and the early adoption of new technologies. The country's transport infrastructure is resilient and has withstood the several earthquakes and other natural disasters that regularly impact the country. There are nine reconstruction plans in place following a series of natural disasters that have impacted the country since 2010, including an earthquake and tsunami in February 2010 that impacted the centre-south region, a series of earthquakes, tsunamis and floods that took place in the north in 2014-15, and the Calbuco volcano eruption of 2015; virtually all damaged infrastructure has been repaired or rebuilt. Reconstruction efforts following a massive wildfire that engulfed large areas in the centre-south in January and February 2017 are still ongoing.
The 2018 budget allocated US$3.7bn for the Ministry of Public Works. Funds will go towards transport infrastructure, including the renewal of public roads, as well as construction of new water reservoirs and irrigation infra-structure. A new underground railway line in the capital, Santiago, opened in November 2017, while a second line is currently under construction and expected to be opened in 2019. Three new lines have also been announced, targeted for completion in 2026. The new lines will expand Santiago's subway system, which is already one of the most extensive metro systems in Latin America. Additional transport funding will be allocated to the two largest metropolitan areas outside the capital, Gran Valparaíso and Gran Concepción, aimed at alleviating some of the congestion that these areas have been experiencing. Chiloé Island will be connected to the mainland through a 2.8 km bridge within the forecast period. There will also be upgrades to five regional airports and construction of a new terminal at the Santiago airport, while early works for a new deepwater port in central Chile are expected to continue, as well as expansion works on several other ports.
Concessions system will remain the norm for infrastructure development
Chile's robust infrastructure is attributable in large part to a successful concession system that was launched in the early 1990s. This stream of public-private partnerships helped to revamp the main north-south highway, Ruta 5, finish construction of numerous regional highways and an urban highway system in Santiago, as well as give a facelift to all major ports and airports in the country. The system saw a steady slowdown from the mid-2000s, when most projects were completed, but some new projects were announced as part of the previous government's US$28bn 2014-21 concessions agenda. Mr Piñera has stated that infrastructure investments during his term are expected to reach around US$20bn, of which US$8bn will come in the form of concessioned works. Some of the projects under consideration are the expansion of the busiest stretches of the Ruta 5 to four or six-lanes; construction of the southern extension of Ruta 5 (Carretera Austral) between Puerto Montt and Villa O'Higgins; and a coastal highway parallel to Ruta 5.
The completion of a key transmission line will reduce costs further
Although energy infrastructure has been seen as the weak link in Chile's infrastructure matrix, this changed during Ms Bachelet's second term, with the implementation of a long-term strategy that extends beyond the forecast period (Energía 2050), as well as a decline in the price of renewable energies, which helped to push an increase in clean energy sources, and the connection between the north and central energy grids. These efforts have helped to contain the price of energy, which for years was a major hindrance to invest-ment.
The completion of a transmission line connecting the main north and central-south electricity grids has been delayed as a result of community opposition. Although originally slated for completion in December 2017, it has now been pushed to end-2018. Once completed, the growing non-conventional renewable energy (NCRE) sector is expected to increase further, as the central-south is where most consumers are situated. NCRE projects already account for 18% of the country's energy supply, and are likely to meet a target of 20% of generation in 2020, five years ahead of schedule.
Following its predecessor's efforts, the Piñera government announced a series of commitments in the energy field. Among the measures included in the "Ruta Energética 2018-21" programme are plans to decarbonise the existing matrix through the conversion of coal-powered plants to cleaner sources, increase the number of electric vehicles tenfold in the four-year period, reduce by 25% the amount of time required to approve the permit of energy projects, and promote energy efficiency among large-scale users (mining and industry, mainly) through a new regulatory framework.

This section, introduced as part of an upgrade to our rankings in 2018, aims to show how future-oriented the business environment is-the extent to which it is digitally connected, open to innovation and prepared for technological disruption.
Chile's score for technological readiness is the highest in the region and 33rd in the global ranking for the forecast period, supported by strong internet usage and efforts by successive governments to improve the country's technological and innovation capacity. Nevertheless, the country suffers from low rates of investment on research and development (R&D). According to figures from the OECD, R&D investment in Chile was 0.4% of GDP in 2016, compared with an OECD average of 2.5%. Following four years of declining figures, investment in the telecoms sector rose by 9.7% in 2017, to US$1.57bn, with 44% focused on mobile telecoms and the remaining 56% on fixed infrastructure, according to the Subsecretaría de Telecomunicaciones (Subtel, the telecoms regulator). Internet usage in the country is high. As at March 2018, mobile broadband internet access was 91.1%, while fixed broadband internet access was 47.7%. Mobile subscriptions are also high, with 129.1 subscribers per 100 inhabitants by end-March, up from 124.6 subscribers registered at end-2017, according to Subtel.
The local retail sector has made important efforts to strengthen its e-commerce strategy. According to figures from the Cámara Nacional de Comercio (CNC, the national chamber of commerce), online sales in 2017 rose by 31.7% from 2016, to an estimated US$4bn. The CNC forecasts that e-commerce sales in 2018 will surpass US$5bn.
The new science ministry will lead national science and technology policy
Congress recently approved the creation of the new Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, which will be tasked with advising the president on all policies, programmes and plans designed to strengthen science and technology. The new ministry will have a technical advisory committee, which will periodically review the ministry's policies, while an inter-ministerial committee, comprised of the ministers of science, finance, economy and education, will be tasked with developing a national science policy, which will be sanctioned by the president.
As part of its tax reform plans, the government recently announced that it is considering taxing international digital companies, including online retail giants such as Amazon (US) and Alibaba (China), ride-hailing applications such as Uber (US) and Cabify (Spain), entertainment companies such as Netflix (US) and Spotify (Sweden), and homesharing sites such as AirBnB (US). The govern-ment is currently considering how to move forward, with several options at hand, including imposing a new transaction tax, enforcing the value-added tax (VAT; currently at 19%) and enforcing customs duties for imported goods. The finance minister, Felipe Larraín, has said the new tax could bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.
The government of Mr Piñera has announced plans to digitalise the public sector as part of its efforts to reduce red tape and bureaucracy. To that end, on July 10th it introduced a bill to congress that orders all administrative decisions to be conducted digitally, rather than, aside from in exceptional cases, on paper, allowing citizens to conduct business with the government over the internet through a digital platform. In addition the bill makes it mandatory to digitally preserve all of the generated files, as well as recognise the validity of digitised documents that were originally issued on paper. The government is also proposing the creation of an open data strategy for the public sector, to be followed by an open data platform.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government of Sebastián Piñera to maintain Chile's record of broadly sound macroeconomic policymaking. Expectations of more business-friendly policies under Mr Piñera (despite little concrete progress so far) are helping to boost confidence and bring about a recovery in investment after four years of contraction. To that end, Mr Piñera will undertake a simplification of tax rules and reduction of red tape, including moving more business registration processes online. Mr Piñera has also promised to create new incentives for entrepreneurship and innovation, and will place a greater emphasis on infrastructure. His public investment plans will aim to improve inter-urban transport nationwide, boost the percentage of paved roads, and increase the rural presence of fibre-optic and wireless internet. He will also increase political autonomy for regional governments to help to better direct local investment. A recently created US$9bn infrastructure fund will support concessions for public-private infrastructure projects.
Mr Piñera's government has discussed reforms to education and healthcare, including universal free pre-schooling. In June Congress approved the creation of a new Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, which will advise the president on improving science-related policies and increasing investment in research and development (which was just 0.4% of GDP in 2016, compared with an OECD average of 2.5%). The government has also proposed new funding and administrative reforms to better direct healthcare spending, particularly for the elderly. Pension reform will remain an important item on the agenda; Mr Piñera has proposed increasing employer contributions, but has said that he would keep the unpopular privately administered funds in place.
Energy policy will remain high on the agenda, as Chile, an oil importer, suffers from high costs and vulnerability to energy shortages; further tax incentives for investors in renew-ables are likely, and the Piñera administration is likely to continue the controversial use of hydroelectric power in southern Chile. Greater concern about the environment and reduced regulation have spurred investment in renewables, and a target for 20% of the energy generation mix to be based on renewable sources is expected to be reached by 2020 (the current level is 17%); Mr Piñera has proposed setting the goal at 100% by 2040.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy

Central government balance -2.8 -2.0 -1.5 -1.6 -1.1 -0.7
We expect lower fiscal deficits amid firmer economic growth, spending restraint and reforms to the fiscal rule that guides policy. This rule sets a structural surplus target based on certain economic assumptions, including projected copper prices and long-term potential GDP growth. The finance minister, Felipe Larraín, wants to improve the framework, because consistent over-estimation of economic growth and the long-term copper price in recent years allowed for higher levels of spending and weakened the public finances. Mr Larraín has announced fiscal austerity measures for the government and state-owned companies. Current plans envision eliminating a combined US$5bn (around 1.6% of forecast 2018 GDP) from expenditure over four years.
Given the very gradual nature of the cuts, the government's plan appears credible, and we believe that this will help to gradually narrow the deficit over the forecast period, a process that will be further supported by stronger real GDP growth and higher copper prices. Following a fiscal deficit of 2.8% of GDP in 2017, we expect a narrowing to 2% in 2018. However, the threat of strike action at Chile's largest mines (several contracts come up for renewal in the second half of the year) poses a threat to this forecast. Assuming fiscal austerity proceeds as expected and copper prices hold (our current forecast is for an annual average copper price of US$3.39/lb in 2018-22), we forecast a narrowing of the fiscal deficit to 0.7% of GDP by 2022. Faster consolidation will be precluded by countercyclical fiscal spending and revenue declines in the face of a forecast slowdown in the US in 2020.
Continuing fiscal deficits will cause the public-sector debt to rise from 24.5% of GDP in 2017 to 27.6% of GDP in 2020, before falling slightly thereafter as the primary deficit narrows and eventually turns to surplus. Only around 19% of central government debt is external. The government is unlikely to face difficulties in accessing financing: Chile's external bonds traded at just 142 basis points above comparable US Treasury notes in June-by far the lowest among Latin America's large economies. In the event of a shock, the government could tap reserves held in its economic and social stabilisation fund, which stood at US$14.6bn in June, and a pension reserve fund, valued at US$9.9bn. The first ever withdrawal (US$314m) from the pension reserve fund since its inception in 2006 was made in September 2017; the last time that any amount greater than US$500m was withdrawn from the stabilisation fund was in the wake of the 2009 financial crisis.

The Banco Central de Chile (BCCh, the central bank) has kept its policy rate on hold at 2.5% since May 2017, after four 25-basis-point cuts in January-April last year. Notwithstanding pressures resulting from tightening by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank), the BCCh has so far shown itself to be cautious of resuming a tightening cycle given signs of economic recovery and relatively muted inflation; the decision to keep rates on hold at the BCCh's July meeting was unanimous. We do not forecast further cuts and expect monetary tightening to begin in early 2019. The BCCh has shown itself to be unfazed by recent currency weakening, although a continued steep fall in the value of the peso (not our baseline forecast) could see tightening resume sooner. We forecast an end-2022 policy rate of 4.5%.

Solid economic fundamentals and improvements in business confidence support brighter medium-term growth prospects, but Chile's open economy exposes it to global developments, particularly changes in prices and demand for commodities-minerals (mainly copper) account for about 50% of goods exports, and the country depends on imported oil. Nevertheless, a more supportive external environment and renewed business confidence will support an economic recovery this year. First-quarter growth figures show that a stronger than expected recovery is underway, with seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter growth of 1.2%, and year-on-year growth of 5%. This growth was driven particularly by investment growth and stronger private consumption. We forecast real GDP growth of 3.7% in 2018, slowing slightly, to 3.6%, in 2019. A brief cyclical deceleration in the US in 2020 will slow Chile's growth to 2.4% that year as lower confidence translates into a fall in investment growth, but a return to higher copper prices in 2020-21 will bring growth back up to an average of 3.1% a year in 2021-22. Although these rates will represent a significant improvement from recent years, growth will be about half the rate posted during the commodities boom.
Private consumption growth will be supported by low real interest rates-notwithstanding mild monetary tightening forecast from early 2019-and falling unemployment. Fiscal austerity will keep government consumption growth muted. Investment will return to growth, supported by public investment projects and resurgent copper investment as prices recover; nonetheless, investment growth will remain below the levels seen during the commodities supercycle. External trade will, on average, not contribute to overall GDP, as growth in imports due to recovering domestic demand will offset any gains from stronger external-especially Chinese-demand for exports.
Industrial activity will barely return to growth in 2018 as mining output increases, supported by higher copper prices. Construction activity will be supported by investment in commercial projects and public works. Growth in services will be reason-able, aided by Chile's advanced retail, shipping and transport sectors, a growing tourism sector, and the country's role as a regional hub for business and financial services. Barring weather-related shocks, growth in agriculture will remain strong in 2018-22, supported by growing Asian demand for Chilean fresh fruit.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Mining will remain among the largest sectors of the economy over the forecast period. With around 170m tonnes in proven high-grade copper reserves-22% of the world's total in 2017-which have the added advantage of being in close proximity to the sea, Chile has been the favourite global destination for copper mining investment over the past two decades. This has made it by far the world's largest copper producer, with output of 5.3m tonnes in 2017, around 27% of the total world copper output. Despite a projected lower copper price environment compared with the 2006-13 boom years, the country will remain a competitive mining investment destination because of its privileged geological conditions, as well as its political and economic stability. The market is divided between Codelco, the state copper firm, and private mining companies, with the latter combined accounting for two-thirds of output. Major multinational mining companies with a presence in Chile include BHP Billiton (Australia), Rio Tinto (UK-Australia), Xstrata (Switzerland), Anglo-American (UK), Freeport McMoRan (US) and Grupo México (Mexico). There are also numerous local private companies, such as Antofagasta.
Output has weakened in recent years, mainly reflecting the decline of copper prices and ore grades. Having grown by over 6% in 2013, output growth then stagnated in the subsequent two years before falling in both 2016 and 2017. The decline in 2017 owes largely to a 43-day strike at Escondida, the country's largest mine, in February and March, as well as flooding in several northern mines. Growth should return this year, as prices and investment have recovered. Nonetheless, declining ore grades have forced mines to invest heavily to keep output stable. Codelco plans US$20bn in investment in the 2017-21 period. The current level of investment should bring production above the 6m-tonne mark by 2020, with substantial gains thereafter.
Codelco's investment plan includes five so-called structural projects: the underground transformation of Chuquicamata (around 56% complete, due to be online by 2019); construction of a new mine level at the company's underground El Teniente mine (47% complete, with start-up due in 2023); the expansion of processing capacity at its Andina and Rajo Inca mines (due in 2025 and 2021 respectively); and an expansion at the Radomiro Tomic mine (currently under review). Codelco's production reached 1.84m tonnes in 2017, up slightly from 1.83m tonnes in 2016. Factoring in the impact of new investment, Codelco expects its copper output to rise until it exceeds 2.1m tonnes in 2020.
The market will continue to be driven mostly by demand from Asia (particularly a rapidly urbanising China, which accounts for around 40% of global copper demand). This will provide support for copper demand, but overall Chinese economic growth is expected to moderate in the years to come, and the price of copper will not return to its recent historical high of 400.4 US cents/lb in 2011 during the forecast period. Instead, after falling to an average of 221 US cents/lb in 2016, copper prices will remain weak, averaging 339 US cents/lb in 2018-22. Although lower than the 2011 level, this is still high by historical standards.

We expect inflation to remain contained owing to a relatively strong peso, resulting from higher copper prices, although a rise in global oil prices will provide some upward pressure. Inflation should accelerate only slightly, from 2.3% at end-2017 to 2.6% at end-2018. Strong domestic demand and oil prices will also help to keep inflation firmly within the 2-4% target range in 2019-22.

The peso's value is strongly linked to copper prices, and we expect higher copper prices and firmer external demand for Chile's exports to support the peso over the forecast period. However, as was evident in April-May, the peso will remain vulnerable to shifts in global risk sentiment, amid ongoing US monetary tightening. We expect the peso to trade at Ps653.7:US$1 at end-2018, before strengthening slightly thereafter amid local monetary tightening, which will narrow interest-rate differentials with the US. Rising copper prices will keep the peso strong in 2020-22, averaging Ps615.3:US$1. The BCCh will have access to ample international reserves (US$37.7bn in July, equivalent to around 60% of estimated total annual merchandise imports) with which to prevent excessive fluctuations, tied particularly to shifts in copper prices.

The current account will remain in a slight deficit in the forecast period, as a growing trade surplus (supported by higher copper prices and export volumes), is offset by a large primary income deficit, owing to rising debt service and profit repatriation by multinational firms based in Chile. The current-account deficit will widen slightly from 1.5% of GDP in 2017 to 1.6% of GDP in 2018. As a percentage of GDP, the trade surplus will remain relatively stable, averaging 2.9%. The services deficit will narrow slightly as a percentage of GDP, reflecting rising income from tourism, but will remain in deficit owing to Chile's dependence on foreign transport services. The secondary income (transfers) surplus will decline slightly as a share of GDP compared with previous years, reflecting higher outward remittance flows due to a rise in inward migration.
Inward foreign direct investment (FDI) will rise in nominal terms in 2018 from a low in 2017: inward direct investment in the first quarter of 2018, at US$6.8bn, exceeded the amount received in full-year 2017 (US$6.4bn). The increase in FDI will be supported by a slight recovery in copper prices (the mining sector typically accounts for a large proportion of inward FDI flows), as well as renewed confidence under the Piñera government. Net portfolio inflows are expected to remain elevated in 2018-22. Chile's deep, open financial system will support high debt and equity-investment inflows in the medium term. Foreign-exchange reserves are forecast to rise only slightly, to US$40.4bn by end-2022, resulting in a slight fall in import cover, but this will remain ample, at nearly five months.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Chile
Stocks and flows
After a dip in 2009 caused by the drying-up of mergers and acquisitions activity during the global recession, foreign direct investment (FDI) in Chile has rebounded sharply in subsequent years. However, FDI fell dramatically between 2015 and 2017, falling from US$21.1bn to US$6.4bn, largely reflecting lower copper prices. However, a recovery appears to be underway this year, with first-quarter FDI reaching US$6.9bn-more than the amount received in full-year 2017. Despite its small size, Chile has historically been an important destination for FDI, particularly in its mining, energy and transport infrastructure sectors. The country's favourable climate for foreign businesses pushed the stock of FDI to US$206.2 in 2017, according to IMF data, resulting in an FDI stock/GDP ratio of 74.5%, compared with much smaller ratios for Brazil (37.9%) and Mexico (48.1%).
Chile's importance as an investor in other regional markets has also increased in recent years, with a focus on the airline, shipping and retail sectors. However, outward flows have declined considerably in recent years, and totalled just US$4.8bn in 2017, down from an annual average of US$15.9bn in 2011-15. This reflected a global decline in cross-border mergers and acquisitions activity, and also political uncertainty throughout Latin America (where most Chilean outward investment flows) ahead of a busy election season in the region. A large stock of outward FDI in 2016 (US$95.4bn, equivalent to 34.4% of GDP, according to data from the Banco Central de Chile-the central bank) is testament to the success of Chilean firms abroad.
Origin and distribution
The US was the largest source of the accumulated FDI stock in Chile in 2016, according to the latest available central bank data, accounting for 14.1% of the total stock of FDI, up from 13.7% in 2015. US investment has been broadly distributed, although it has made a strong contribution to wholesale and retail trade, largely owing to a US retailer, Walmart, acquiring the largest local supermarket chain, D&S, in 2009. The second-largest source was Canada, accounting for 8.9% of investment in 2016. This largely reflects expansion plans by Canadian mining firms in the country, which have grown considerably in recent years. Following was Spain, accounting for 7.5% of the total. Spanish investment has slowed since the 2008-09 financial crisis, but the large stock reflects earlier investments in utilities and infrastructure, where many Spanish firms operate through build-operate-transfer (BOT) concessions. There is also important participation in telecommunications and financial services, mainly by firms such as Telefónica and Santander. The next largest source of the FDI stock is the Netherlands, also accounting for 7.5% of the total in 2016 (although the Netherlands is a favoured European business location, so this investment may partly have come from other countries). Other sources include Brazil (4% of the total in 2016), the UK (3%), Japan (2.3%) and Italy (1.2%). However, much of the FDI flowing to Chile is routed through tax havens such as Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas, Luxembourg and others, making it difficult to ascertain fully the countries of origin. Regarding the sectoral distribution of FDI stocks, mining accounted for 29% of the total in 2016, followed by financial services (28.2%) and utilities (electricity, gas and water, at 8.9%). Other important sectors that have attracted significant foreign investment in recent years include manufacturing, transportation, communications, real estate and business services, and retail.
Determinants
Chile's foreign investment regime, which has been in place for three decades, is one of the most liberal in the world. There is a well-respected principle of non-discrimination between local and foreign investors, who also enjoy additional protection as a result of the rapidly expanding network of investment-protection accords and double-taxation treaties signed with other countries. Generally sound regulation, combined with political and economic stability, and firm growth, have helped to boost FDI inflows since the early 1990s. Moreover, Chile's managerial talent and well-qualified labour force (by regional standards), together with a strong rule of law, low crime rates and a large network of free-trade agreements (FTAs), have attracted a growing number of multinationals to use Chile's capital, Santiago, as a headquarters for Latin America. Moreover, the entry of Chile into the OECD in 2010 has made it subject to various investment-related provisions and guidelines relating to liberalisation of capital movements and trade in services (including business and financial services, insurance, culture, tourism, and travel).
Impact
FDI funded a growing share of gross fixed investment in Chile in the 1990s. FDI averaged 25.5% of gross fixed investment in 1996-98, compared with 10.4% in 1990-92. In 2001-06 FDI funded 28% of the gross fixed investment that materialised in Chile in that period, contributing to the modernisation of infrastructure, including telecoms. The ratio rose to an annual average of 37.8% in 2007-15, owing to large mining and energy investments. It has slipped significantly since, reaching just 10.8% in 2017, but is expected to rise, albeit to a more modest annual average of 23.6% in 2018-22. FDI has also made a major contribution in terms of the transfer of technology and managerial expertise, and has helped to foster competition between local and foreign firms in most major consumer markets, thereby providing Chileans with wider product ranges and lower prices than in neighbouring countries. Outward FDI has grown as Chilean businesses have expanded abroad and has helped to consolidate many local firms into becoming important regional players in their respective sectors. Although outward FDI flows dropped to US$4.8bn in 2017, down from an annual average of US$12.2bn in 2007-15, this is still a robust level (outward FDI stock totalled US$90.5bn in 2016, according to the central bank). The fact that Chilean firms operated in a competitive domestic environment well before regional peers liberalised their own economies has enabled businesses to position themselves successfully in neighbouring countries. In no sector has this been more evident than in retail, where firms such as Ripley, Paris and Falabella have aggressively expanded into other markets such as Peru, Argentina, Colombia and Brazil.
Potential
Chile will continue to attract large FDI inflows, owing to its transparent business operating conditions, political stability, a fundamentally sound economy, a huge network of FTAs, double-taxation and investment-protection accords, the most modern infrastructure in Latin America, and a growing pool of skilled labour. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects FDI inflows to average 5% of GDP annually in 2018-22, slightly below the pre-crisis average of 7.2% of GDP in 2004-08, but well below the level of 9.2% of GDP recorded in 2011-15, during the commodities supercycle. The major acquisitions common in the banking, telecoms and utilities sectors over the past two decades are unlikely to be repeated at the same pace, given already near-complete levels of economic openness and liberalisation. Nevertheless, the services sector (for example) will have ample opportunities in a market in which incomes are expected to continue to grow steadily. Renewable energy and related industries (such as lithium extraction) will also attract significant investment.

Working-age population grows slowly while overall demographic profile ages
Chile's population growth rate is forecast to decelerate modestly, from 0.8% to 0.7% per year between 2018 and 2022. This will bring the total population to 18.7m by 2022, leaving Chile the least populated of Latin America's seven largest economies, and the only of the seven that will have a population below 20m by 2022. The national statistics office projects that the rate of natural population growth-the crude birth rate minus the death rate-will continue to slow, from 8.6 per 1,000 annually in 2010-15 to 7.4 in 2015-20, and 6.2 in 2020-25. Although Chile displays a maturing demographic profile, the share of the working-age population will remain roughly stable, at around 68% of the total, in 2018-22. The rise in the share of the population above working age (13% will be 65 or older by 2022) will bring this statistic to among the highest of 12 Latin American countries covered by The Economist Intelligence Unit's Country Forecasts.
Chile has traditionally been an immigrant-receiving country, although not to the same extent as other South American countries such as Argentina or Brazil. Before the Second World War, migration largely came from Europe and the Middle East, whereas since the 1970s most migrants have come from neigh-bouring Peru and Bolivia, with migrants often working in low-skilled jobs in agriculture and construction, or as domestic help. However, the pace of inward migration has accelerated since 2005, with the number of foreigners in the country increasing by 123% between 2005 and 2014, to around 416,000. This represented the highest proportion of foreign-born people living in Chile since 1920. As at 2017, the government estimates there are now around 1m foreigners living in the country, of which it estimates that 300,000 are undocumented.
The immigration surge largely owes to the arrival of Venezuelans and Haitians in the light of humanitarian crises in both countries, as well as increased econ-omic migration from countries such as Colombia, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic, attracted by the higher wages and quality of life in Chile. We expect net inward migration to continue, given Chile's relative pros-perity within Latin America, but expect it to proceed at a more moderate pace than in 2015-17, as the government has instituted new laws to control the inward flow. Outward migration from Chile peaked during the 1973-90 dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, but has slowed considerably since. The government esti-mates that around 500,000 Chileans live abroad, largely in Argentina, the US and Sweden.
Inward immigration is rising but will not boost overall population growth.
Chile's basic health indicators are similar to other OECD countries, reflected in an average life expectancy of 79.9 years in 2018-22 (82.4 years for women and 76.5 years for men) and infant mortality of 6.6 per 1,000 live births. Demand pressures on the healthcare system are more akin to those of an industrialised country than a developing one. Infectious diseases and problems such as malnutrition are largely under control outside of small pockets of extreme poverty. However, age and "lifestyle-related" conditions associated with sedentary living and increased consumption of processed foods, such as obesity (75% of the population are overweight or obese), heart disease, colon cancer and diabetes, are on the rise.
Public healthcare policies will increasingly target obesity and unhealthy lifestyles. Only 2.5% of children under six were at risk of malnutrition in 2010, but 22.8% were overweight (9.7% of these obese). A universal health plan, the Plan de Acceso Universal con Garantías Explícitas (Plan AUGE), was created in 2005, offering fixed-price treatments for 80 conditions, including many expensive illnesses. The policy is sold at a fixed price and guarantees a maximum waiting time for medical attention for each condition. The public system covers around 80% of the population, against 17% covered by private insurance. The Piñera government has introduced plans to reduce waiting times and the accessibility of care in the public system, but no major reforms to the provision of care appear on the cards.
Labour market reform will fail to incorporate informal workers
Modest growth in the working-age population will add some pressure to the labour market in the medium term. The economy was close to full employment in 2013, with unemployment at a historical low of 6%, but weak growth has caused unemployment to rise since then, to 7.2% in the April-June rolling quarter of 2017. This is low by regional standards. Informality is estimated to cover around 36% of the labour force, according to the OECD-also a low figure by Latin American standards (it is frequently over half, even in large economies). However, the informal sector represents a large pool of untapped labour, which could, if brought into the formal market, boost long-term growth and tax revenue

After contracting, income per head in US dollar terms will grow in 2017
Chile's market opportunities are constrained by its small population, estimated at 18.1m in 2017 (forecast to grow to 18.7m by 2022), but its high income-combined with a legacy of political stability and effective economic management-will continue to make the country one of the most attractive destinations for investment in the region. In most of the past three decades it has outperformed all of the other economies in Latin America in terms of GDP growth, and The Economist Intelligence Unit expects slower but still-firm expansion of 3.2% on average in 2018-22. Inequality has been decreasing over the past decade, allowing a larger share of the population to access consumer goods and services. Low levels of unemployment and rising real incomes have supported this trend. However, inequality is still pronounced, and there are also income discrepancies between metropolitan and northern regions, and less affluent regions in the centre-north and centre-south.
Potential for more exports and import purchases will remain strong
The impact of weaker economic growth and sharp peso depreciation will begin to ease, with Chile's GDP per head in US-dollar terms rising to US$16,695 in 2018 (from US$15,341 in 2017), and reaching US$21,657 by 2022. According to IMF data for 2015, Chile's GDP per head (as measured in US dollars at purchasing power parity) is the highest in Latin America (excluding the Caribbean). In tandem with rising incomes, consumption will rise over the next five years (albeit at a slower pace than in the previous five-year period), to reach US$13,590 per head by 2022. Chile's open economy and abundance of natural resources have encouraged specialisation in export-oriented activities, particularly mining. Copper and other minerals have long been Chile's main sources of export revenue, but a slump in global prices in 2015-17 provided an additional spur to non-traditional exports after years of policies promoting trade diversification. Chile is the world's second-largest salmon exporter (despite having no native salmon population), the fifth-largest wine exporter (and seventh largest producer) and the largest regional exporter of fresh fruit. The country also has a fast-growing tourism sector. However, Chile's potential is limited by its small manufacturing base, which is dominated by agro-industrial output. As a result, a large share of consumer goods-such as electronics, cars and clothing-are imported. The share of imports in household expenditure will rise in 2018-22 as higher levels of discretionary spending boost demand for more diverse and expensive foreign goods.

Consumer markets in Chile are well developed and competitive, owing to a free-market-oriented economy that has encouraged participation by foreign firms, as well as import penetration for a wide range of consumer goods. This has helped to bring prices down and attract a large number of participants, despite the small size of the economy, in effect turning it into a showcase market for firms wishing to expand in the region. For example, around 50 carmakers compete in the Chilean market, including Chinese and Indian firms.
Other highly competitive sectors include telecom-munications and retail. Supporting consumer expenditure is a deep and sophisticated financial sector that has historically benefitted from ample credit supply, relatively low interest rates and narrow loan-deposit spreads. Large foreign and local firms co-exist in the banking and insurance sectors, with the insurance sector enhanced by high and rising statutory obligations. The private pension market is highly liquid and-uniquely among Latin American economies-has created a large pool of institutional investors, deepening local capital markets. Despite this, the conservative lending practices of the banking system mean that small and medium-sized enterprises often find it difficult to obtain financing; these constraints do not present a problem for larger blue-chip firms, which can access a wider range of financing options. In addition, there has been an expansion by retail chains into consumer lending (and even into mortgage lending and insurance brokerage) in recent years. Although this has helped to boost credit availability to some of Chile's lower-income households, there are concerns about the looser lending standards of retailers.

Chile's long-term outlook benefits from continued adherence to prudent monetary and fiscal policies, coupled with a commitment to the rule of law and protection of property rights. A wide network of bilateral free-trade agreements (FTAs) has helped Chile to attract foreign direct investment, while simultaneously helping local firms to expand abroad. It has also helped to diversify the economy into areas in which the country had previously lacked comparative advantages, although a pronounced bias towards mining, the country's single largest industry and source of exports, will persist. Chile's efforts to become a regional platform for multinational corporations will continue, facilitated by the country's reputation for stability and security, its well-developed financial system, and the quality of its transport and communi-cations infrastructure, as well as a comprehensive network of FTAs, double taxation agreements and investment protection accords. Chile's catch-up with the US has been good, with GDP per head-in US dollars at purchasing power parity (PPP)-increasing from 20% of that of the US in 1990 to 40% in 2017. This slow convergence will continue as growth outpaces that of the US, to reach a forecast 43% in 2022.
Initial conditions: Chile is a small country, representing only a 0.2% share of world population in 2017, but it punches above its weight in its share of world GDP (0.4% at PPP), and global exports are strong (0.3% of the total). Chile's GDP per head of US$15,341 in 2017 at market rates was the highest among Latin American economies (excluding the Caribbean). In PPP terms, GDP per head was US$24,080 in 2017, also the highest among non-Caribbean Latin American countries. In 2010 Chile became the second Latin American country after Mexico to become a member of the OECD. Chile will continue to attract manufacturing investment, but its competitiveness as a global manufacturing centre will lag behind that of its Asian rivals. That said, Chile will continue to find success in non-traditional production such as agro-industry and fisheries-and possibly some consumer goods, once Asia's labour cost advantages erode. As a commodity producer, Chile faces more volatile terms of trade than its Asian competitors, whose comparative advantage is founded on low-cost manufacturing rather than raw materials. This implies that Chile's growth will remain strongly linked to international copper prices for the foreseeable future. The peso remains weak against its 20-year average, which will help to boost competitiveness for non-mining exports.
Demographic trends: Although Chile's population is still young by international standards, its demographic profile is ageing. Annual population growth will average 0.6% in 2018-30, above the 0.4% growth of the working-age group in the period, which signals a rising dependency ratio. Nevertheless, the labour force will grow during the same period, owing to a drop in young-age dependency. Despite Chile's relative affluence and the quality of its social services, immigration has not significantly contributed to overall population growth in recent decades. Although it may begin to do so over the next decade, the effect will not be significant. As a result, the demographic outlook will be dominated by trends among the native-born population, whose birth rates will continue to fall.
External conditions: Growth in export industries will be boosted by Chile's large network of FTAs. However, the single most important external factor affecting the Chilean economy is the international price of copper. Prices have fallen substantially, from a peak of US$4/lb in 2011 to a low of US$1.96/lb in December 2015, owing to the global slowdown and the end of the so-called commodities supercycle; they have since recovered to around US$3/lb in 2018, but remain at the mercy of global sentiment. In the long term, however, demand growth from China and India, as well as other emerging economies, will keep copper prices high by historical standards. Chile has diversified its export base over the past 15 years, notably into non-traditional sectors such fruit, salmon and wine. Nonetheless, mining (mainly copper) still accounts for approximately half of total exports, and The Economist Intelligence Unit expects this dominance to diminish only marginally, given Chile's unique geological and geographical advantages in natural resource extraction. Service exports will also grow, benefitting from Chile's position as a regional business hub. Open and liquid capital markets make the country the most developed financial centre in the region-and second in size only to Brazil and Mexico-with ample crossborder opportunities in banking, insurance and securities markets arising from deeper regional integration. Finally, growing international awareness of the country's significant natural beauty will provide a major boost to tourism in the medium and long term.
Institutions and policy trends: Chile will maintain its strong pro-market policy direction of the past three decades. However, social pressures and the rising expectations of the middle classes will lead to an increase in public-sector participation in certain sectors. Governments will dramatically extend state funding of university places (tertiary education currently remains highly market-oriented) and renewable energy. Civil service reforms will support bureaucracy efficiency and transparency, and steps to reduce red tape will benefit the business environment as administrative procedures are simplified. Modernisation of the judiciary will accelerate legal procedures, which already benefit from one of the most independent and least corrupt judicial systems globally. Governance will be characterised by professionalism and credibility, offering investors minimal risks of policy reversals. Public frustration with graft and collusion will prompt reforms to reduce corruption. Constitutional reform will lead to a degree of symbolic decentralisation and a more parliamentary (rather than presidential) system of government.
Long-term performance: Chile's tradition of policy continuity, abundant natural resources, a favourable investment climate and modern infrastructure will be supportive of firm economic growth in the long term. The Chilean economic model will remain investment- and export-led, based on solid macroeconomic fundamentals, monetary stability and countercyclical fiscal management. Productivity growth will be helped by investments in new technologies and a gradual move towards higher value-added activities (made evident by the shift from agriculture to agro-industry). The financial sector will remain competitive, owing to a large pool of institutional investors (private pension funds, mutual funds and insurance companies), providing businesses and households with ample financing through credit and capital markets.
In the long term, modernisation of the education system and a more flexible labour market will be necessary to unlock higher potential growth; both these issues are being tackled by the Piñera government. The 2015 linking of Chile's north and central electricity grids could prove the catalyst for a revitalisation of the country's fragile energy matrix, which has resulted in Chile having some of the highest energy costs in the region. The lack of major fossil fuel reserves will provide an impetus towards developing renewable energy sources, and the country is on course to meet a target of 20% power generation via renewables in 2020, five years ahead of schedule (a long-term objective of 70% by 2050 appears more than feasible). At the same time, there is significant opposition to major hydroelectric projects on environmental grounds, and some green alternatives such as solar energy remain expensive, suggesting that Chile will be burdened by energy insecurity into the medium term. Overall, we forecast that average annual GDP growth will reach 3.2% in 2018-30, falling to 2.4% in 2031-50. As growth in the working-age population slows, economic expansion will become more dependent on productivity gains and less so on the contribution of labour.

Climate change and sustainability
Chile's long coastline and diverse topography leave it highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Changing climate dynamics will increase the likelihood and severity of natural disasters such as floods, droughts and landslides. These will directly disrupt some sectors of the economy, including agriculture and tourism, and will especially affect the country's water resources. According to climate change projections by Chile's meteorological office, precipitation in Chile's south-central area, and also in the northern part of Patagonia, should see temperatures rise and also see precipitation fall by around 60% between 2030 and 2059. Given that this is the heart of Chile's agricultural region, and also for its farmed salmon industry, this will have a serious impact on the Chilean economy. Temperature rises affecting the oceans will also affect sea life, causing less abundance and diversity available to Chile's fishing industry. This has been felt to some extent already in recent years, with an El Niño effect in 2016 affecting the fishing industry, and a major drought affecting the country in 2018. The drought has caused the government to declare a water emergency in 61 communes given water shortages, with 102 also declared in an agricultural emergency. The Universidad de Chile says at least 25% of the factors contributing to this year's drought reflect human action.
Although there is no national plan to combat climate change, or mitigate its effect, there are many sectoral or short-term plans to deal with the problem. However, in July the government proposed a law on climate change, which will be discussed between July and December this year, and presented to Congress in July 2019. Although the law is still in its early stages, it is expected to establish a medium- and long-term framework for reducing the effects of climate change, and create the institutions to help climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts.
An aging demographic profile
Chile's demographic profile shows an increase proportion of the population over 65. According to government statistics from 2015, 3m people were over 65, making up around 16.7% of the population. This is expected to climb to over 20% of the population by 2025. Between 1992 and 2017, the proportion of the population older than 60 grew by 5 percentage points, while that under 15 declined by 10 percentage points. This makes Chile one of the oldest populations in Latin America and the Caribbean (behind only Cuba and Uruguay). In addition to a lower birth rate, this also reflects an increase in life expectancy in the past 20 years as Chile has become a more affluent society. The aging of the population presents a unique challenge for a developing country, where until recently the challenge was providing sufficient economic growth and jobs for a working-age population.
The effect of Chile's aging population has already been seen in the country's politics, with the state of the country's pension system becoming a major issue in the 2017 election. The government has also had to address the fiscal costs of an aging population by promoting the hiring of senior citizens (to keep them in the workforce) and incentivising the postponement of retirement. The government has also sought to increase the number of doctors specialised in geriatrics working in the public health system and adapt urban infrastructure to accommodate the needs of the elderly. The shrinking percentage of the working-age population as a percentage of the overall population has also made immigration more attractive to Chilean policymakers. The country has bowed to political pressure to standardise its immigration system after a massive inflow in 2015-17, but still remains committed to welcoming regulated inward immigration.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2013-17) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2018-22). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2013-17. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2018-22 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.

Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2013-17 ranges are then used to derive 2018-22 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2018-22, not to the likely situation in 2022 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2015 or 2020). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Abstract: [...]he led the ÖVP to the largest share of the vote in the early election in October last year, winning a 31.5% share-up by 7.5 percentage points on the party's result in 2013. To assuage concerns from Mr Kurz and the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, about the FPÖ's previous Euroscepticism, the party has agreed not to push for a referendum on EU membership. [...]EU policy is handled by the chancellery instead of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is headed by an FPÖ appointee. [...]real GDP growth was 3.1% in 2017-above the level in Germany for the first time since 2005, and Austria's fastest growth rate since 2007. 2013a 2014a 2015a 2016a 2017a 2018b 2019b 2020b 2021b 2022b The labour market (av) Labour force (m) 3.8 3.8 3.9 3.9 4.0 4.0 4.1 4.1 4.1 4.1 Labour force (% change) 1.2 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.3 1.1 0.8 0.4 0.3 0.2 Employment (m) 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.7 3.8 3.8 3.8 3.8 Employment (% change) 0.5 0.6 0.9 1.5 1.9 2.2 1.4 0.8 0.5 0.3 Unemployment (m) 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 Unemployment rate (av; %; national measure) 7.6 8.4 9.1 9.1 8.5 7.5 6.9 6.5 6.3 6.2 Unemployment rate (av; %; EU/OECD standardised measure) 5.4 5.6 5.7 6.0 5.5 4.8 4.4 4.1 4.0 4.0 Wage and price inflation (% except labour costs per hour) GDP deflator 1.6 2.0 2.3 1.1 1.6 1.7 1.7 1.8 1.4 1.3 Consumer prices (av; EU harmonised measure) 2.1 1.5 0.8 1.0 2.2 2.0 1.9 2.1 2.1 2.0 Producer prices (av) -1.1 -2.0 -3.6 -2.4 4.7 2.7 1.5 2.2 2.4 1.8 GDP deflator (av) 1.6 2.0 2.3 1.1 1.6 1.7 1.7 1.8 1.4 1.3 Private consumption deflator (av) 2.1 2.0 1.4 1.2 2.0 2.2 2.1 2.0 2.1 1.9 Government consumption deflator (av) 1.2 1.4 2.2 1.1 1.2 2.0 1.9 2.1 2.1 2.0 Fixed investment deflator (av) 1.8 1.8 1.6 1.4 1.6 1.9 1.9 2.2 2.0 2.1 Average nominal wages 2.6 2.4 2.2 1.6 1.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.6 2.5 Average real wages 0.5 0.9 1.3 0.6 -0.7 0.6 0.8 0.7 0.5 0.5 Unit labour costs ([euro]-based; av) 1.1 0.3 0.2 -0.2 -1.4c 0.1 0.4 0.2 -0.2 -0.6 Unit labour costs (US$-based) 4.4 0.3 -16.4 -0.5 0.6c 6.0 0.2 1.7 0.0 1.5 Labour costs per hour ([euro]) 33.1 34.0 34.8 35.4 36.0c 37.1 38.1 39.3 40.4 41.5 Labour costs per hour (US$) 44.0 45.2 38.6 39.2 40.7c 44.3 45.5 47.5 49.0 51.3 a Actual.b Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts.c Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
An early election in October 2017 was won by the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), led by the young minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, who has since become chancellor at the head of a majority coalition government of the ÖVP and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to last a full five-year term.
The inclusion of the FPÖ in the government will not lead to significant tensions with other EU member states as it did in 2000, when the party was last part of a coalition. This is largely because of the normalisation of the far right in Europe since then.
The new government will focus on integration and immigration policy, including by taking a prominent role on this issue within the EU. It will attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and introduce some additional flexibility in labour and product markets. Significant structural reforms are unlikely, owing to low government cohesion.
We forecast that the government budget will remain in deficit-albeit well within the EU-mandated limit of 3% of GDP-throughout the 2018-22 forecast period, as the fiscal consolidation process is likely to be restrained by limited government cohesion and effectiveness. The public debt/GDP ratio will fall gradually, to 67.2% by 2022, from 78.2% in 2017.
After several years of underperformance compared with its regional peers, the economy has performed relatively strongly since the start of 2016, growing by 3.1% in 2017. We forecast a continuation of strong growth this year, at 2.9%, and a moderation to 1.6% on average in 2019-22.
Consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) will continue to exceed the euro zone average in 2018-22, driven by structural domestic factors, including higher unit wage costs and more regulated markets. We expect annual average EU harmonised inflation of 2% in 2018-22.
The current-account surplus has been relatively stable in recent years. Although we expect small changes in the composition of the surplus, we expect it to remain broadly stable, at 1.6% of GDP on average in 2018-22, driven mainly by a strong surplus on the services balance, supported by tourism inflows.

Austria's business environment score rises between the historical period (2013-17) and the forecast period (2018-22), mainly owing to the improved economic outlook. Austria's strengths as a business location include good infrastructure, stable institutions and co-operative labour relations, but high taxes, limited market opportunities and restrictive regulations will persist.
Country forecast overview: Austria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government works on reducing red tape, but progress is likely to be limited.
2020-22: Modest strengthening of competition authority's powers. Administrative reform reduces red tape. More transparency in antitrust proceedings. Risk of political interference in private firms in which state owns substantial stakes.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Foreign investment is generally welcome, but underlying opposition to takeovers of "national champions" persists.
2020-22: Possible erosion of barriers against foreign takeovers as a result of commercial pressure and EU legislation.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: No exchange controls. Foreign trade, governed by EU rules, should remain liberal. Risk of disruption, owing to trade dispute between the EU and the US.
2020-22: EU maintains focus on bilateral free-trade agreements as multilateral trade negotiations stagnate.
Taxes
2018-19: Limited changes to the tax system aimed at reducing the sizeable income tax wedge.
2020-22: Vested interests will continue to hamper large-scale reform, and the high tax burden will remain.
Financing
2018-19: Financial stability to improve amid tighter regulatory requirements and a reduction in risk from exposure to central and eastern Europe.
2020-22: Further uptake in corporate bond issuance. Credit conditions continue to ease as banks' profitability recovers, in part supported by a gradual uptick in interest rates.
The labour market
2018-19: Economy-wide minimum wage introduced. More stringent requirements for early retirement and invalidity pensions. Labour market slowly improves as increase in labour supply moderates and unemployment continues to fall.
2020-22: Continued modest expansion of labour supply, primarily via net immigration, but concerns about shortage of skilled employees in certain sectors are likely to persist. Early retirement phased out.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Further take-up of broadband services. Gradual improvement of transport links with eastern Europe.
2020-22: Improved transport network connecting main urban centres and providing better access to the country's interior.
Technological readiness
2018-19: Internet use remains slightly below several regional peers, but research and development remains relatively high.
2020-22: Further progress made on upgrading the large manufacturing sector to take advantage of new technologies.

Background: Austria became an important force in central Europe with the formation of the Habsburg empire in the 15th century and remained so until the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the first world war. The Republic of Austria emerged in 1918. In 1938 Austria was incorporated into the German Third Reich. With the departure of the victorious Allied forces in 1955, it regained independence as a neutral country. In the post-war period Austria took great strides to catch up economically with the rest of the developed world and is now one of the most advanced nations. It is a member of the EU and a participant in economic and monetary union (EMU).
Political structure: Austria is a federal republic, and the head of state is the federal president. The government is led by the federal chancellor. The national parliament has two houses: the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house), of 62 members appointed by state parliaments, and the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house), which has 183 members elected by proportional representation. An early general election was held on October 15th 2017.
Policy issues: The government will focus on migration and integration issues, including in the EU context. It will also attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and implement other measures to improve the business environment, including through enabling more flexibility in the labour market.
Taxation: Austrian labour tax as a percentage of GDP is among the highest in the EU. A 2016 tax reform lowered the tax burden for low- and middle-income earners, but raised the top personal income tax rate from 50% to 55%. Social security contributions, shared between employers and employees, are high. Corporation tax is levied at a rate of 25%. Dividend and investment income is subject to a withholding tax of 27.5%. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a standard rate of 20%, and a reduced rate of 13% (raised from 10% in 2016) applies for certain goods and services.
Foreign trade: Trade relations are dominated by Germany, which accounts for about one-third of total imports and exports. The current-account surplus is driven by strong tourism exports boosting the services surplus. We expect modest current-account surpluses throughout the forecast period.

The governing coalition consists of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). The Economist Intelligence Unit expects this coalition to prove relatively stable and to sit out a full term to 2022. This follows several years of little progress on reforms and coalition (as well as party) in-fighting under the grand coalition of the ÖVP and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ), which fell apart in May 2017. The popular 31-year-old minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, took over the leadership of the ÖVP, reformed the party around himself, and moved it closer to the FPÖ on issues such as immigration and integration. As a result, he led the ÖVP to the largest share of the vote in the early election in October last year, winning a 31.5% share-up by 7.5 percentage points on the party's result in 2013. The SPÖ's share was unchanged, at 26.9%. The FPÖ increased its share of the vote by 5.5 percentage points, to 26%. The liberal NEOS returned to parliament with just over 5%, and the Greens failed to cross the 4% electoral threshold for the first time in 31 years, in part because List Pilz, led by a former leader of the Greens, narrowly managed to cross it.
In mid-December, after just over a month and a half of negotiations, the ÖVP and the FPÖ formed a coalition. Under Mr Kurz the ÖVP has moved closer to the FPÖ in many policy areas, and the negotiations therefore went relatively smoothly. To assuage concerns from Mr Kurz and the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, about the FPÖ's previous Euroscepticism, the party has agreed not to push for a referendum on EU membership. Moreover, EU policy is handled by the chancellery instead of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is headed by an FPÖ appointee.
The chancellor is from the ÖVP, but the election was nevertheless a decisive moment in the fraying of the decades-long dominance of the political scene by the SPÖ and the ÖVP, as the ÖVP has, to a large extent, been replaced by Mr Kurz's new movement. The two parties had together ruled the country almost continuously since 1945, but a renewed grand coalition had become almost impossible following a breakdown in relations and the reform gridlock in recent years. The FPÖ has profited from this and from concerns about immigration, although Mr Kurz also owes much of his popularity to his strong stance on this issue, and his plans to curtail migration into Europe and Austria.
Despite the overlap between the ÖVP's and the FPÖ's programmes, we do not expect the government to implement significant structural reforms, as the coalition partners are likely to disagree on economic matters, on which they are significantly less aligned than they are on social and cultural matters. In addition, the FPÖ could struggle to translate its opposition stance on topics such as immigration and integration into firm policy proposals. The initial phase of the government's term is likely to be relatively smooth, owing in part to the country's role as president of the Council of the European Union until the end of 2018. Later in the term the FPÖ might struggle to distinguish itself from the ÖVP, which could lead to tensions between the parties, creating a moderate risk of an early election.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
The most recent general election was held on October 15th 2017. We expect the government to remain in office until the end of its term, which ends in late 2022, maintaining its majority in the Nationalrat (the lower house of parliament). There is a risk of an early election, although we believe that the probability of a snap vote is small. The next election for the (primarily ceremonial) post of federal president will be in 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Austria was severely affected by the European migrant crisis, and this has been the dominant issue in its domestic politics and international relations since 2015. The country has been at the centre of many of the intra-EU spats regarding the bloc's response to the large influx of migrants. Domestic pressure on the govern-ment to be seen as acting against this inflow, and thus often against other EU member states, will remain high. The new government plans to cut child benefit payments flowing abroad, potentially leading to tensions with eastern member states in particular.
Nevertheless, Mr Kurz has been at pains to point out that his government will be pro-EU, and that Austria's EU membership will not be questioned in the coming years. The government wants Austria to be a leading voice in the bloc, especially on migration reform, which should be facilitated by the country's role as president of the Council of the European Union. We expect the govern-ment to move forward with proposals such as tighter controls of the EU's outer borders and processing asylum applications outside the EU.
Although the previous inclusion of the FPÖ into government, in 2000, led to sanctions being imposed by other EU nations, the reception has been more muted this time. In that period a far-right nationalist party entering government was an unusual development, but since then sister parties to the FPÖ have either entered government or supported minority governments in several EU countries, including some Nordic countries and the Netherlands. However, this will, at times, lead to tensions with fellow EU members, as shown by the fact that a number of countries are now sharing less intelligence with Austria because the ministries concerned are headed by the FPÖ.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
The new government plans to move integration and immigration policy further to the right, including through curtailing benefits for asylum-seekers and cutting child benefits that are sent abroad. It has also presented plans that focus on improving the business environment, including by reducing corporate tax rates and introducing more flexible working hours. Furthermore, it plans to cut a number of labour market programmes aimed at the long-term unemployed and integrating migrants into the labour market. Although it has announced a push to centralise and streamline the welfare system-to which several major stake-holders, including state governors, are likely to object-it does not plan to reform the so-called Proporz system, under which the ÖVP and the SPÖ had apportioned public entities and functions (state companies, public services, subsidies and regulatory responsibilities). This is despite suggestions from both coalition parties-especially the FPÖ-in the past that they would want to do this. We therefore expect reforms to remain limited to small-scale efforts in only a few areas, such as the labour market, and that the government will struggle to implement significant structural reforms rapidly.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Driven by both a lacklustre recovery following the financial and euro zone crises and a lack of fiscal consolidation, the fiscal accounts have remained in modest deficit in recent years and within the 3% of GDP limit set by the EU. Strong growth contributed to a narrowing of the deficit to 0.7% of GDP in 2017.
The government plans to achieve a small budget surplus in 2019 by cutting spending and at the same time reducing income taxes and the country's sizeable tax wedge. However, it has not yet clearly outlined the spending cuts that it intends to make, barring a number of smaller measures, including cutting spending on asylum-seekers, and we therefore do not share the government's optimism that a surplus can be reached in 2019. Nevertheless, continued robust economic growth will contribute to a further narrowing of the deficit in the coming years; we expect it to average 0.3% of GDP in 2018-22.
The public debt stock as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline gradually, from 78.2% in 2017 to 67.2% in 2022. Although the public finances will remain in a worse state than in countries such as Germany or the Netherlands, the low interest-rate environment and Austria's relatively strong fundamentals mean that funding risks are extremely low, in our view.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The European Central Bank (ECB) is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a quantitative easing (QE) programme that is running at EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018. The programme will run at EUR15bn per month in October-December before coming to an end. Economic activity in the euro zone has softened this year, but the ECB's view of the outlook remains fairly positive. Rising commodity prices and evidence of building domestic price pressure in some parts of the euro zone should mean that sufficient inflationary pressures will begin to emerge on the policy horizon in 2019-20. In response, we expect the ECB to take steps towards normalising its policy stance, with an increase of 25 basis points in the main refinancing rate to 0.25% in early 2020, followed by five more rises that will lift the main refinancing rate to 1.5% by end-2022. An increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019, easing the pressure on banks' lending margins and supporting profitability.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Austria's initial recovery from the global financial crisis was respectable in the euro zone context, but the economy subsequently stalled and underperformed compared with regional peers, notably Germany. This was particularly striking given the traditionally high level of synchronisation between the two countries' business cycles. A faltering reform process in recent years contributed to higher inflation compared with regional peers, and weakened productivity growth, admittedly from fairly high levels. However, the economic recovery gained significant momentum from the second half of 2016. Although in previous years the labour market had struggled to integrate the significant increase in the labour force, it seemed to have turned a corner in late 2016 and early 2017, owing in part to a surge in employment in the manufacturing sector. We expect a continued gradual improvement in labour market indicators in the coming years. This is supporting private consumption, which we expect to grow by 1.9% this year. Export and investment growth have also picked up. As a result, real GDP growth was 3.1% in 2017-above the level in Germany for the first time since 2005, and Austria's fastest growth rate since 2007.
We expect the current phase of catch-up growth-after an underperformance compared with fundamentals in recent years-largely to continue this year. However, we forecast slower real GDP growth, of 2.9%, as we expect the impulse from the manufacturing sector in 2017 to be less pronounced in 2018. Nevertheless, increasing labour shortages will contribute to business investment pushing up investment growth in the first half of our five-year forecast period. Driven by the improvement of the labour market, domestic demand will be the main driver of growth. In the following years we expect a further moderation of growth, to 1.6% on average in 2019-22-around the economy's potential growth rate. Government policy is likely to be supportive of growth in the coming years, and the main risks are external. As a highly open economy, Austria is vulnerable to global economic developments. We expect the impact of the trade dispute between the EU and the US to be limited for Austria. However, an escalation beyond one more round of mutual tariff impositions, including on automotive imports by the US, continues to pose a significant downside risk to the outlook.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Annual consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) has been subdued in recent years, but higher than in most other euro zone countries. Inflation averaged 0.9% in 2015-16-well above average inflation in Germany and the euro zone. This largely reflects structural domestic factors, such as higher unit wage costs, more regulated markets, and a period of faster increases in taxes and duties. Rising services prices and energy price base effects caused a gradual increase in inflation in 2017, leading to a full-year average of 2.2%. We expect full-year average inflation of 2% in 2018, driven in large part by the uptick in global oil prices in the first half of 2018. A strengthening of the euro will weigh slightly on inflation, but we expect price growth to stay above the euro zone average in 2019-22, at 2% on average, as similar structural factors seen in previous years persist.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
In 2017 the euro rallied as the region's economic recovery strengthened and expectations of QE tapering increased, and as political risk waned in Europe but rose in the US. The exchange rate peaked at almost US$1.25:EUR1 at the beginning of February 2018 but had weakened to US$1.16:EUR1 by late May in response to formation of a populist, Eurosceptic government in Italy, and remained close to that level in June-July. The value of the euro could yet come under further pressure from political risk in Italy, and also from monetary tightening in the US. Nevertheless, we expect a broad stabilisation on average, at US$1.20:EUR1 in 2018-21, as the euro is supported by an ongoing recovery in the region and receives structural support from a large current-account surplus, while the business cycle downturn in the US will weigh on the value of the dollar in 2020. Thereafter we expect the euro to appreciate to US$1.24:EUR1 on average in 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
Low oil prices and subdued domestic demand compressing import values have helped the trade balance to move into surplus in recent years, from a deficit in 2009-13. However, the increase in oil prices in 2017 pushed it back into a modest deficit, and we expect gradually widening trade deficits throughout the forecast period. Nevertheless, we expect the current account to remain in surplus, with the main driver being the healthy surplus on the services balance, driven in large part by robust tourist inflows. This will ensure that the current-account surplus will tick down only slightly throughout 2018-22 but will average 1.6% of GDP.

Abstract: In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly. After years of ineffectual leadership, most citizens, even those opposing the PSUV, distrust opposition parties. [...]they are incapable of channelling the anger generated by the country's economic crisis. [...]wastefulness at state-owned firms and massive corruption and clientelism schemes built around the delivery of subsidised goods and services would be hard to roll back without antagonising government backers, risking political instability. [...]we would expect a mixed administration to focus on macroeconomic essentials, such as the stabilisation of the currency and local prices, and tackling mismanagement of PDVSA. [...]we expect extremely limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will limit economic recovery and fuel continued unrest.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Economic collapse and the erosion of the patronage scheme supporting the president, Nicolás Maduro, put the ruling regime's internal cohesion in jeopardy. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a traumatic rift that will end in regime pragmatists allowing opposition participation in a "mixed admin-istration" as a way to remain in power from 2019 onwards. There is a risk that the existing regime will retain cohesion and cling to power beyond 2019 if it finds financing to meet its debt obligations and boost dwindling oil production.
We estimate that inflation exceeded 2,000% at the end of 2017 and will average over 10,000% in 2018. GDP will continue to contract in 2018-20. High inflation has led to a collapse in private consumption, and difficult operating conditions have hurt investment. Following a change in policy under a new government, we expect economic growth to resume in 2021.
The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. From 2019 a new government will stabilise the economy, but the wholesale rethink of the institutional framework needed to restore investment and confidence is unlikely.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and hyperinflation will hit private consumption, and an increasingly difficult operating environment will accentuate a fall in fixed investment. The recession that began in 2014 will continue to deepen despite a partial recovery in oil prices as oil output slumps, and the economy will not return to growth until 2021-assuming that a new government takes power and implements reforms. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
US dollar measurements of Venezuela's market size provide an overly positive picture of the economy, given the marked overvaluation of the fixed exchange rate. In reality, recession and extremely high inflation (driven by shortages of foreign exchange and basic goods) will continue to restrict purchasing power. After 2020, under a new government, we expect purchasing power and the business environment to improve.

Venezuela is in 82th position globally in our business environment rankings for 2018-22, making the country the least attractive invest-ment location in our ranking. This reflects the highly heterodox macroeconomic policies of an authoritarian government, a lack of legal security and weak institutions.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government persists with bias against free markets and ad hoc recourse to heterodox measures. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition. Property rights remain weak.
2020-22: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Access to project financing is difficult and uncertainty over contractual rights persists.
2020-22: Efforts to attract foreign investment gather pace under a new government, although actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2018-19: Opaque currency controls add to uncertainty, severely restrict private-sector access to foreign exchange and impede trade. New government in 2019 starts removing exchange controls.
2020-22: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2018-19: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite the huge fiscal deficit. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2020-22: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2018-19: Amid severely high inflation, financing remains only available in the short term and banking sector shrinks in real terms.
2020-22: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2018-19: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. An ongoing freeze on redundancies, combined with a large informal sector and skill shortages, makes the labour market exceptionally rigid.
2020-22: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Underinvestment in the water and electricity grid ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2020-22: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued water and electricity rationing.
Technological readiness
2018-19: E-government services remain almost non-existent and deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies.
2020-22: Limited regulator capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has plummeted as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices has plunged the country into a massive economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded republican institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is how to stabilise an economy mired in a years-long economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. At the same time, mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign-exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Using IMF data, The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$21.1bn in 2017 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages. We estimate the current-account surplus at 1.4% of GDP that year.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
Despite a decimated economy and spiralling hyperinflation, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) and the president, Nicolás Maduro, retain their hold on power. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects worsening economic conditions to result in a chaotic political transition, most likely ushering in a government with nominal opposition participation-a "mixed administration"-in 2019. We expect curtailed political stability in 2019-22. The opposition, of which the Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD) is the biggest grouping, remains in disarray. Apart from infighting, this reflects the PSUV's systematic campaign to disenfranchise opposition parties and sideline them from state institutions. After years of ineffectual leadership, most citizens, even those opposing the PSUV, distrust opposition parties. Thus, they are incapable of channelling the anger generated by the country's economic crisis.
In this context of unrest and repression, the PSUV is increasingly dependent on the military for support. The country is run by civic-military alliance and a network of businessmen with military or political connections. The accord is sustained by opportunities for arbitrage and corruption made possible by foreign-exchange controls, subsidised imports of basic goods and control of public-sector companies. Within this arrangement, factions are primarily explained by personal and patronage ties, which means that different civic-military factions coexist within the regime. The ultimate source of resources flowing through this patronage system is PDVSA, the state-owned oil company, whose exports account for the vast majority of foreign-exchange inflows into the country.
Jeopardising the civic-military-business alliance is a rapid decline in oil production due to mismanagement and underinvestment. Resultant strains have been highlighted by recent purges in the military. Furthermore, in June Mr Maduro reshuffled key positions in the administration, giving increased power to Diosdado Cabello, a long-time internal rival who has extensive military and business ties; Mr Cabello will now lead the Constituent Assembly (ANC, the country's de facto legislature). We interpret this as Mr Maduro attempting to regain internal support, even at the expense of personal power. Regardless, discontent seems to remain, as exemplified in July by unusually public criticism of the administration by other high-ranking PSUV members. Although Mr Cabello is a leading PSUV figure it is unclear if his recent elevation will quell discontent within the party. Indeed, unless the administration turns PDVSA around (we see this as unlikely, as the government lacks the required expertise or financing), we believe that the patronage system supporting Mr Maduro will be at risk of collapse by 2019.
Internal fracture in the regime may happen earlier than 2019, as the secular trend towards lower oil output may be hastened by sanctions on oil trade by the US, PDVSA's largest cash-paying market. Similarly, unpaid debts may lead to seizures of PDVSA's shipments or infrastructure, which would impede trade. If such measures become commonplace and/or reach Citgo, PDVSA's US-based subsidiary, exports could be disrupted indefinitely.
Regardless of the timing, what happens following the internal fracture is hard to predict. The transition is likely to be violent. The PSUV's internal stability is a concern, as the end of the current set-up is likely to unleash jostling for position between the PSUV's varied civic-military factions. If no faction secures sufficient internal consensus, a period of chaos of indeterminate duration may ensue.
Alternatively, the regime may reconfigure itself, with an outright military government or PSUV civilian figureheads fronting a military-heavy admin-istration. These would probably look to Russia and China, erstwhile backers, for aid to stabilise both the economy and PDVSA. However, we believe that the required financing-tens of billions of US dollars per year-is beyond Russia's means. Despite recent announcements, China has scaled back its financial support for Venezuela since 2015.
With these financing sources unavailable, the reconfigured regime may still reach internal stability and-given the opposition's weakness-remain in power, albeit resigned to the country's and PDVSA's impoverished state. However, given that the regime's raison d'etre is the enrichment of its members, stabilis-ation of PDVSA and the economy would be likely to take priority under a new government, and we expect regime pragmatists to seek western assistance-specifically from multi-laterals and governments. As these financiers will demand democratic reforms, we believe that the most likely outcome is a "mixed administration", in which pragmatically minded regime leaders allow opposition participation to gain international legitimacy. Given past behaviour, there should be no shortage of opposition figures willing to participate.
The main risk to this "mixed administration" baseline view is that regime pragmatists will be unable to convince other regime members of the benefit of this arrangement. Democratic reforms that western lenders would insist on may not be acceptable to some PSUV figures. Similarly, foreign financing would underpin a macroeconomic programme that-by eliminating the economy's distortions-would close avenues for corruption and upset regime insiders. Other hurdles of uncertain size will remain. These include the judiciary, the ANC and violent supporters of the current regime, known as colectivos. If these risks materialise in sufficient force, our alternative scenarios-a permanently impoverished nation or chaos of indeterminate duration-could materialise.
Overall, we expect a chaotic transition starting in late 2018 or early 2019. The process will be highly uncertain and may feature several false starts, and we expect the remainder of the forecast period to be characterised by political instability.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
Mr Maduro comfortably won re-election on May 20th. However, voter turnout was exceedingly low, at 46%, denting the president's legitimacy and introducing questions about the regime's actual control of the population. (The PSUV's get-out-the-vote operation uses a combination of ideological affinity and coercive tactics.) We do not expect free and fair elections in the short term. Based on our assumption of a new government comprised of government and opposition pragmatists, an electoral timetable may be announced, as international financing will almost certainly come with demands for democratic reforms.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Most regional governments have denounced the Venezuelan government, as has the EU. The most effective measures have come from the US, which has instituted country-level sanctions that deny Venezuela the possibility of refinancing its debts. Sanctions banning the oil trade outright are not part of our baseline assumption, but a hawkish US foreign policy team increases the risk of this happening. A key priority for the Maduro administration will be the maintenance of good relations with Russia and China. Both have provided financing in the past but seem unwilling to provide the several billions of dollars needed to stem the decline of oil output.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
The government remains unable and unwilling to undertake the policy changes needed to address its main challenges, namely declining oil production, hyperinflation and mounting arrears on external debt. Most sovereign and state-owned firms' bonds (including those of PDVSA) are now in arrears. The government has called for debt restructuring, but it appears impossible, owing to US financial sanctions and, more fundamentally, because the government lacks a credible economic programme. There is no sign yet of lawsuits by bondholders, who so far appear to prefer the hope of late payment to lengthy legal battles. Investors may also be waiting for news of policy changes or, given strains in the PSUV, a change in leadership. In the meantime, both the sovereign and PDVSA are open to legal challenges in the US. Asset seizures could hit exports, the regime's economic lifeline.
In the meantime, the government must grapple with a severe economic crisis. Monetisation of large public deficits and dwindling exports have led to foreign currency rationing and hyperinflation. The government has devalued the official exchange rate, but monetary imbalances persist and foreign-exchange continues to be rationed. Economic policy will remain interventionist in the short term, deepening the economic crisis that drives our baseline forecast of a move towards a mixed administration.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect that more orthodox economic policies to be implemented. However, the administration will face considerable internal limitations in addressing key policy challenges. For example, wastefulness at state-owned firms and massive corruption and clientelism schemes built around the delivery of subsidised goods and services would be hard to roll back without antagonising government backers, risking political instability. Thus, we would expect a mixed administration to focus on macroeconomic essentials, such as the stabilisation of the currency and local prices, and tackling mismanagement of PDVSA.
Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and multilaterals (totalling US$19bn in 2019-22) and the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. Internal cohesiveness in the mixed administration will be key, as the PSUV is ideologically opposed to such borrowing and multilateral financing is likely to come with conditions on democratic reforms. Meanwhile, PDVSA must open itself to foreign investment to secure the finance needed to bring output back on track. This will require considerable political capital, as it would imply a wholesale revision of the sector's institutional framework. Pockets of resistance are likely to exist. Internal stability within the PSUV will remain a major risk to our forecast, as the success of a mixed administration would depend on PSUV pragmatists fending off more radical party members, who would oppose accepting international assistance and reforming policy.
Outside of these areas, we do not expect much success in rolling back the PSUV's strong interventionist bent in the economy. As a result, we expect extremely limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will limit economic recovery and fuel continued unrest.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Authorities have not published data on fiscal accounts since 2011, when the non-financial public-sector (NFPS) deficit was 12% of GDP. We forecast an NFPS deficit of 15.5% of GDP in 2018, which will largely be financed by printing money. High inflation and the overvalued official exchange rate make debt/GDP ratios misleading indicators of fiscal stability. Considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) understates the true size of total public liabilities.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect a restructuring with external creditors in 2020. Owing to the need to maintain political stability, we do not expect the closure of the various handout programmes in operation, nor the removal of utility subsidies or the reformation of inefficient state-owned firms. Therefore, we expect public expenditure to be hard to reduce; we expect the deficit to be substantial throughout the 2018-22 period, ending 2022 at 7% GDP.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (the central bank) to print money. In mid-July money supply (M2) grew by 65% month on month. The government has not announced any change in policy other than planning to take five zeroes off the currency. We expect a new administration to place a much greater emphasis on tackling hyper-inflation, and expect a substantial monetary adjustment in the context of a macroeconomic stabilisation plan.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Amid ongoing disruption to Venezuela's productive base, we project further contractions in real GDP in 2018-20, following an estimated contraction of 13.9% in 2017. Our forecast recovery in 2021-22 rests on the assumption of a political transition that, supported by IMF financial and institutional assistance, produces a credible macroeconomic programme with improved management of the country's oil wealth at its centre. However, the reform programme will be limited in scope by a weak government, and we only expect a partial rebound in real GDP, following a decline of over 50% in 2013-20.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2018, reflecting the effect on real wages of hyperinflation as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will also continue to contract, reflecting the difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. Our forecast for a recovery in investment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition and a pick-up in investment in the oil sector. Oil output-already in the midst of a long decline owing to mismanage-ment and underinvestment-has contracted beyond expectations in recent months; we now expect it to bottom out at 1.1m barrels/day (b/d) in late 2019, down from an average of 2m b/d in 2017. Under our baseline forecast of openness to foreign investment under a new government from around 2019, oil production will start a recovery in the second half of 2020, but will remain well below 2m b/d even at the end of our forecast period in 2022. Export volumes will only start to recover in 2021, as an increase in domestic demand, which has been artificially constrained, will initially absorb the increase in oil output. For the same reason, import demand will rise sharply.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Decimation of domestic supply, severe limits on imports and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official data have not been published since 2015, but the opposition-led National Assembly has estimated that monthly inflation was 80% in April, bringing year-on-year inflation to over 13,000%. We expect inflation to average well over 10,000% in 2018. There is a high risk of a hyperinflationary spiral in coming months that increases inflation to well above our current forecast and necessitates a dramatic adjustment, probably involving a resort to currency substitution.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
Since the start of the year the government has devalued the official exchange rate by over 96%. The rate is supposedly determined by an auction system, but the government-which mono-polises the country's exports-has not supplied the system with foreign-exchange, making the system unsustainable and access to foreign exchange practically impossible, even at the current rates. In late July the black-market exchange rate was around BsF3,500,000:US$1; the official rate stood at BsF172,800:US$1.
Given existing distortions in the foreign-exchange market and growing hyperinflation, the government may, as part of a stabilisation plan, introduce a new domestic currency or attempt some kind of currency substitution in the future. Under our current political assumptions, similar measures may be undertaken after 2019. The exact nature and implementation of the plan is hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
We expect the current-account surplus to reach US$12bn in 2018. This figure is buoyed by non-payment on interest on bonded debt (US$5.5bn) and our exclusion of repayments to Chinese lenders-a decision taken to maintain consistency with the World Bank's data on debt, on which our forecasts are based. We expect the government to continue to accumulate arrears into 2019. By 2020, with a new government in power, we expect that-following a renegotiation of debt-external financing will be restored and imports will begin a recovery. We expect the surge in imports to tip the current account into a deficit of US$1.8bn (or 2.5% of GDP at the less highly-distorted exchange rate) in 2020. As the government will then be complying with its debt obligations, the restructured debt will actually mean increased outflows in interest payments. This, coupled with the slow recovery of the oil sector and years of unmet import demand, will mean that the current-account deficit will remain high, at over 4.5% of GDP on average in 2021-22.
However, we expect that the new administration will secure enough financial and investment inflows to provide sufficient financing, stabilising balance-of-payments dynamics. However, there are considerable risks to this rosy outlook. In addition to assuming a pragmatic mixed administration capable of retaining power, it hinges on a substantial assistance package from the IMF, the quick implementation of a successful macroeconomic stabilisation package, the fast resolution of a debt renegotiation process in 2019-20, substantial inflows of financial and real investment into the economy in 2020-22, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

Abstract: To win seats parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president and leader of the AKP, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. The state of emergency was initially introduced after the failed coup attempt to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric who is accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. Since 2016 the state of emergency has allowed the government to continue its campaign against political opponents, critics and perceived enemies of the state, to curtail freedoms of expression, assembly and association, and to politicise the judiciary. [...]Mr Erdogan and the AKP will refrain from making any decisions that could jeopardise the AKP's success in the local elections. [...]the central government deficit, which captures most of the public-sector expenses, expanded from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to 1.5% in 2017.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
On June 24th Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected as president for a second term in snap presidential and parliamentary elections. Mr Erdogan's conserva-tive Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a coalition majority in parliament with the right-wing, Nationalist Action Party (MHP).
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Mr Erdogan and the AKP to remain in power throughout the forecast period (2018-22), and possibly beyond.
Following the June elections an executive presidency now replaces the former parliamentary system of government. The new system will provide few checks on the president's powers, raising the risk of discretionary policymaking.
Since the failed coup in 2016 there has been a marked deterioration in Turkey's relations with its Western allies. We expect a complete rupture to be avoided, but tensions will remain high.
Turkey's relationship with the US will deteriorate in 2018-22, owing to bilateral tensions that appear hard to resolve. The possible US imposition of sanctions on Turkish banks for evading US Iran-related sanctions is a risk.
Turkey's relationship with the EU will become increasingly transactional. Turkey will not make progress with accession talks and is unlikely to manage to renegotiate the terms of its customs union with the EU.
Uncertainty about the direction of Turkey's economic policy continues to cloud the country's medium-term economic outlook. The government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign-policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate.
We forecast a slowdown in real GDP growth from 7.3% in 2017 to about 4% per year in 2018-22, reflecting higher taxes, higher interest rates, a gradual tightening of global liquidity and more moderate export growth.
The lira will depreciate in nominal terms against the US dollar throughout our forecast period, to almost TL5:US$1 at end-2022, as a result of negative foreign investors' sentiment, high inflation and a large current-account deficit.
We expect the current-account deficit to widen in 2018, to 6.7% of GDP, before contracting to a still large 4.8% per year on average in 2019-22. Turkey will struggle to meet its high external financing needs throughout our forecast period.

Turkey's score deteriorates only slightly in 2018-22, but in the global rankings the country falls by ten places, to 59th. There is consensus among policymakers on the need to maintain macroeconomic stability. However, the failed coup and the government's response have increased the level of uncertainty about the direction of policy. Shortcomings include a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Privatisations are likely to be delayed amid the post-coup upheaval in the state institutions. Some companies, notably those with media holdings or ties with the Gulenist movement, remain subject to heavy-handed state intervention.
2020-22: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2020-22: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Capital controls are not considered. There is a boost to trade and tourism following the lifting of Russian sanctions.
2020-22: Negotiations with the EU to update the customs union are likely to be protracted given poor Turkish-EU relations.
Taxes
2018-19: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Some tax rate rises, including on company profits, are introduced in 2018 to curb the widening of the budget deficit.
2020-22: Income tax base becomes broader as exemptions and exceptions are reduced.
Financing
2018-19: Political pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey not to raise interest rates significantly remains possible. Risk of the US imposing fines on several Turkish banks over alleged violations of US sanctions on Iran.
2020-22: Banking system remains stable, despite weaknesses. Heavy reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2018-19: Relatively high labour costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment.
2020-22: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2018-19: First phase of third airport in Istanbul becomes operational. Slower progress made on other projects.
2020-22: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks might persist.
Technological readiness
2018-19: Spending on research and development remains moderate at about 1% of GDP, holding back efforts to move the economy up the value-added ladder.
2020-22: Turkey's young population spurs further rapid digital transformation of the banking sector.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe (in 1949) and NATO (in 1952), and signed an association agreement with the then European Community (in 1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but the coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey currently has a unicameral parliamentary system of government, with parliament elected for a four-year term. To win seats parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president and leader of the AKP, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was re-elected as president for a second term in June 2018. Following Mr Erdogan's re-election, a presidential system of government will come into effect and the prime minister position has been abolished.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability is Turkey's biggest policy challenge. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and changing global liquidity conditions require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy relatively tight to attract adequate capital inflows. The Kurdish issue, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is one of Turkey's most pressing policy issues, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015, and there has been a resurgence in violence. The failed coup highlighted institutional weaknesses that, with the AKP's consent until 2013, had allowed the secretive Gulenist movement to infiltrate the state. Politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The corporation tax rate has been raised in 2018, from 20% to 22%. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Reducing tax evasion was one of the elements of previous IMF programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2017 goods exports came to US$166bn and imports to US$225bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$59bn and a current account deficit of US$47bn (or 5.6% of GDP). The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
On June 24th Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected as president for a second term in the first round of a snap presidential election. On the same day Mr Erdogan's conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) secured a parliamentary coalition majority with its right-wing ally, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP). Both votes took place well ahead of the originally scheduled date of November 2019, as the president sought to take advantage of his current popularity. The election process appeared mostly free, but largely unfair-opposition candidates received little or no media coverage; the candidate of the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP), Selahattin Demirtas, campaigned from prison; and the government restrains freedom of speech and freedom of association. However, the outcome of the elections appears clear; Mr Erdogan secured about 53% of the vote on a turnout of 86%. In addition, results published by opposition observers almost mirrored those announced by the government.
Mr Erdogan's re-election concludes Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. This move was initiated with a constitutional referendum in April 2017, which the government narrowly won. Under the new system the president will be granted wide-ranging executive powers, including in the selection of the majority of top officials in the judiciary, while parliament will be greatly weakened. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that the AKP and Mr Erdogan, who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, will remain in power until 2023, and possibly beyond.
Mr Erdogan will continue to clamp down on domestic political dissent and opposition. He will also seek to delegitimise and weaken the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP). However, Mr Erdogan will probably not renew the state of emergency when it expires on July 18th. The state of emergency was initially introduced after the failed coup attempt to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric who is accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. Since 2016 the state of emergency has allowed the government to continue its campaign against political opponents, critics and perceived enemies of the state, to curtail freedoms of expression, assembly and association, and to politicise the judiciary.
The operational capacity problems created by the purge of the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) and the police after the attempted coup appear to have eased to a large extent, but security risk remains high. Turkey is vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Islamic State (IS). Neither the government nor the PKK are interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will return to 1980s levels. Turkey's military operations in Syria are seeking to block the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds affiliated with the PKK, but risk further fuelling the conflict with the PKK in Turkey's south-east. The formation of a parliamentary coalition between the AKP and the MHP will have a detrimental effect on attempts to resolve the Kurdish issue, as the MHP is likely to push for hawkish policies aimed at constraining and delegitimising the HDP. In addition, the MHP will advocate repatriation of Syrian refugees and adopt a tough stance on all issues related to national security, in line with Mr Erdogan's ultra-nationalist and conservative views.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
Parliamentary and presidential elections were held on June 24th, earlier than the originally scheduled date of late 2019. The elections were brought forward in the light of high and growing economic uncertainties, the still high popularity of Mr Erdogan and the AKP, and the rise in nationalist sentiment in the context of Turkey's military operations in northern Syria.
Mr Erdogan was re-elected as president in the first round of the election, securing 52.6% of the vote on a turnout of 86.2%. In the parliamentary election the AKP lost its absolute majority but secured a coalition majority alongside its partner, the MHP. This was due to the fact that the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic party (HDP) secured more than 10% of the vote, thereby crossing the necessary threshold to enter parliament despite Mr Erdogan's repeated attempts to weaken the movement. The AKP received 42.6% of the vote; its coalition partner, the MHP, 11.1%; the CHP 22.6%; the HDP 11.7%; and the Good Party (IP) 10%.
Local elections will be held as planned on March 2019, despite recent signals from the AKP that point to an increasing possibility of bringing them forward to November or December 2018. The AKP-MHP coalition would probably have an interest in holding these elections early, while the economic situation remains favourable. However, the AKP-MHP coalition would struggle to pass the necessary constitutional amendment in parliament. The shift of focus to the local polls in the aftermath of the June elections is a sign that Turkey will remain in election mood until next year. As a result, Mr Erdogan and the AKP will refrain from making any decisions that could jeopardise the AKP's success in the local elections.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign policy sphere. There is a risk of a rupture in the country's ties with its traditional Western allies, compounding these allies' concerns that under Mr Erdogan Turkey is pivoting eastwards towards Russia, China and Iran. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration in relations, including a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup; the US's military backing of PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurdish groups; the Turkish government's authoritarian tendencies and its strident anti-Western rhetoric; tensions over gas exploration in the eastern Mediterranean; Turkey's forging of closer relations with non-Western countries; and, more recently, growing tensions with Israel in the aftermath of the US's decision to relocate its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Turkey's confrontational approach to its traditional Western allies should also be viewed in the context of Mr Erdogan's need to maintain the support of the country's nationalists to achieve his domestic political goals-notably, to implement an executive presidential system now that he has been re-elected as president.
The country's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and increasingly transactional rather than strategic, but we expect Turkey and its Western allies to avoid a complete breakdown in relations. However, this might become unavoidable if the EU suspends Turkey's moribund accession negotiations, the migrant deal with the EU collapses, the US imposes sanctions on Turkey over violations by Turkish banks of US sanctions against Iran, or Turkey closes the Incirlik air base to US forces or withdraws from NATO, none of which can be ruled out. Operation Olive Branch, Turkey's crossborder military operation in Afrin in north-western Syria that was launched in January 2018, has accentuated tensions with the US. The operation cleared the area of US-backed, PKK-affiliated Kurdish groups that are intent on establishing a continuous autonomous region along Syria's northern border with Turkey.
Turkey's involvement in the conflict in neighbouring Syria will continue to influence the direction of Turkey's foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly regarding the conflict in Syria, where they are co-operating but have been pursuing contrasting goals. We expect relations to continue to be largely transactional. The risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Turkey's economy has shown resilience during past bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing largely to the country's solid public finances, its well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector and its dynamic, diversified private business sector. However, an intensification of domestic political instability, rising regional tensions and tightening global liquidity con-ditions could disrupt foreign capital inflows during the forecast period (2018-22).
These inflows are needed to meet the country's large external financing requirements (savings have always been low), but tend to be short-term and highly volatile. Shifts in capital flows, triggered by expectations of tighter US monetary policy and geopolitical tensions in the neighbouring region, have put the lira under severe pressure on several occasions since late 2016, most recently in May-June 2018, fuelling a sharp acceleration in inflation as well as increasing the cost to firms of servicing their foreign debt (in local currency terms) and thereby raising the risk of defaults for corporates.
Uncertainty about the direction of Turkey's economic policy continues to cloud the country's medium-term economic outlook. The government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. The current direction of policy appears to be towards fiscal loosening and relatively tight monetary policy.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios-reflecting the positive impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past and major upward revisions to Turkey's national accounts-have given the government some leeway to loosen fiscal policy to support the economy in the aftermath of the July 2016 attempted coup. As a result, the central government deficit, which captures most of the public-sector expenses, expanded from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to 1.5% in 2017.
Despite a series of tax increases this year, increased government spending on defence, security, infrastructure projects, public employment and social benefits will cause the deficit to widen further, to an annual average of 3% of GDP in 2018-19, before narrowing gradually to 1.8% in 2022. We expect the central government debt/GDP ratio to decline gradually, from 28.3% of GDP at end-2017 to 26.4% in 2022. Our baseline forecast is predicated on the assumption that fiscal policy will be kept relatively tight to support investor confidence.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The Central Bank of Turkey will have to keep its monetary policy tight in 2018 in order to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent further depreciation of the lira against the US dollar amid political volatility, higher US interest rates and balance sheet tapering by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank). A 300-basis-point rise of the late liquidity window lending rate on May 23rd, an announcement on May 28th to simplify the central bank's monetary policy framework and a further 100-basis point rise (to 17.75%) in the key lending rate on June 7th suggest that economic orthodoxy is overcoming political pressures not to raise interest rates.
We expect that the Central Bank of Turkey will gradually have additional leeway to respond to currency weakness and inflationary pressures now that Mr Erdogan has secured his re-election. However, we do not expect that this relatively larger capacity will be sufficient to enable the central bank to raise interest rates to levels that would be credible in bringing inflation down to its (highly unrealistic) 5% target. In the light of Mr Erdogan's unorthodox comments on interest rates, further political pressures against significantly tighter monetary policy cannot be ruled out. In the context of rising regional tensions, tightening global liquidity conditions and rising inflation in the short term, this could prevent the central bank from maintaining investor confidence if financial conditions deteriorate, possibly prompting the imposition of capital controls; however, this is not our baseline scenario.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Real GDP growth accelerated sharply, from an annual average of 3.3% in 2016 to 7.3% in 2017, supported by government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand.
In 2018 we expect growth to slow to 4%. This deceleration reflects the impact of tax increases, higher interest rates, a gradual tightening of global liquidity feeding into a depreciating currency (against the US dollar), increased domestic instability and higher inflation, all of which will offset planned stimulus measures to boost employment and investment. There are considerable downside risks to our forecast, stemming from foreign capital inflows being deterred by further political instability in the transition to a presidential system of government, regional tensions, domestic financial fragilities and the higher interest rate environment in advanced economies. We forecast that GDP growth will average 4.3% per year in 2019-22.
We forecast that household consumption growth will moderate from 6% of GDP in 2017 to a still solid 3.7% per year in 2018-22 as a result of higher interest rates and slower employment growth. We expect government consumption growth to accelerate from 5.1% in 2017 to an annual average of 5.8% in 2018-19, easing to a more moderate but still robust average of 4.8% in 2020-22.
The deterioration in the business environment and foreign investors' confidence since the attempted coup in July 2016, and an increase in the corporation tax rate to 22% from 2018 will continue to hold down private-sector fixed investment growth. However, we expect this to be offset by government investment, especially in infrastructure. In 2020-22 we forecast a deceleration in yearly investment growth, reflecting public-sector retrenchment and firms' response to a more moderate expansion of domestic and external demand.
The lifting in June 2017 of Russian sanctions on Turkey (especially in the tourism sector), the positive effect of a depreciating lira (against the US dollar) on export competitiveness and strong external demand have contributed to a rebound in exports of goods and services. However, we expect export growth to slow in 2018-22, owing to global trade tensions following the US decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Our expectations of a nominal depreciation of the lira during the forecast period will dampen import growth and support external competitiveness.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Consumer price inflation is stubbornly high-well above the official 5% medium-term target, at 15.6% year on year in June. Reflecting the political constraints on the ability of the central bank to tighten monetary policy further, the recent depreciation of the lira against the US dollar and rising global commodity prices, we believe that inflation will average 12.7% this year. We believe that inflation will decline gradually in the forecast period, reaching 8.1% at end-2022. There are significant upside risks to our revised forecast if the lira depreciates much more rapidly than we are currently forecasting.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
The lira lost about 17% of its value against the US dollar in 2017. In 2018 we expect a further depreciation of about 16% in the light of high political uncertainty and decreasing foreign investors' confidence. This pace of depreciation assumes a relatively benign political environment, a mild shift by the authorities to a more conservative economic stance, a gradual tightening of global monetary conditions and relatively tight domestic monetary conditions. Shocks to any of these assumptions, such as the broad global sell-off in emerging-market assets in April-June 2018 after a faster pick-up in nominal yields in the US, would lead to a more abrupt depreciation. In 2019-22 we expect the pace of depreciation to slow in nominal terms. This will result in a mild appreciation in real terms after six consecutive years of real effective depreciations. We expect the lira to average TL4.93:US$1 in 2022, compared with TL3.65:US$1 in 2017.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
Owing to particularly large trade deficits at the end of 2017 and in early 2018, the depreciation of the lira and rising global commodity prices, we expect the current-account deficit to widen from 5.6% of GDP in 2017 to 6.7% of GDP this year. However, moderating capital inflows will keep the lira weak and interest rates relatively high, contributing to a slowdown in import demand and a consequent narrowing of the current-account deficit during the forecast period. Turkey's substantial external financing needs will be difficult to meet if global liquidity is constrained and investor confidence deteriorates further. We expect the rebound in tourist arrivals in 2017 to continue, but they will remain vulnerable to a possible resurgence of terrorist attacks.

Abstract: [...]he led the ÖVP to a plurality of the vote in the early election in October last year, winning a 31.5% share-up by 7.5 percentage points on the party's result in 2013. To assuage concerns from Mr Kurz and the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, about the FPÖ's previous Euroscepticism, the party has agreed not to push for a referendum on EU membership. [...]EU policy is handled by the chancellery instead of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is headed by an FPÖ appointee. [...]real GDP growth was 3.2% in 2017-above the level in Germany for the first time since 2005, and Austria's fastest growth rate since 2007. 2013a 2014a 2015a 2016a 2017a 2018b 2019b 2020b 2021b 2022b The labour market (av) Labour force (m) 3.8 3.8 3.9 3.9 4.0 4.0 4.1 4.1 4.1 4.1 Labour force (% change) 1.2 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.3 1.1 0.8 0.4 0.3 0.2 Employment (m) 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.7 3.8 3.8 3.8 3.8 Employment (% change) 0.5 0.6 0.9 1.5 1.9 2.2 1.4 0.8 0.5 0.3 Unemployment (m) 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 Unemployment rate (av; %; national measure) 7.6 8.4 9.1 9.1 8.5 7.5 6.9 6.5 6.3 6.2 Unemployment rate (av; %; EU/OECD standardised measure) 5.4 5.6 5.7 6.0 5.5 4.9 4.4 4.1 4.0 4.0 Wage and price inflation (% except labour costs per hour) GDP deflator 1.6 2.0 2.3 1.1 1.6 1.7 1.5 1.8 1.4 1.3 Consumer prices (av; EU harmonised measure) 2.1 1.5 0.8 1.0 2.2 2.0 1.9 2.1 2.1 2.0 Producer prices (av) -1.1 -2.0 -3.6 -2.4 4.7 2.4 1.5 2.2 2.4 1.8 GDP deflator (av) 1.6 2.0 2.3 1.1 1.6 1.7 1.5 1.8 1.4 1.3 Private consumption deflator (av) 2.1 2.0 1.4 1.2 2.0 2.2 2.1 2.1 2.1 1.9 Government consumption deflator (av) 1.2 1.4 2.2 1.1 1.2 2.0 1.9 2.1 2.1 2.0 Fixed investment deflator (av) 1.8 1.8 1.6 1.4 1.6 1.9 1.9 2.2 2.0 2.1 Average nominal wages 2.6 2.4 2.2 1.6 1.5 2.5 2.7 2.8 2.7 2.6 Average real wages 0.5 0.9 1.3 0.6 -0.7 0.5 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.6 Unit labour costs ([euro]-based; av) 1.1 0.3 0.2 -0.2 -1.5c 0.0 0.4 0.2 -0.2 -0.5 Unit labour costs (US$-based) 4.4 0.3 -16.3 -0.5 0.5c 7.2 -0.5 1.0 0.0 1.5 Labour costs per hour ([euro]) 33.1 34.0 34.8 35.4 36.0c 37.0 38.1 39.2 40.4 41.5 Labour costs per hour (US$) 44.0 45.2 38.6 39.2 40.7c 44.8 45.7 47.5 49.0 51.4 a Actual.b Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts.c Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
An early election in October 2017 was won by the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), led by the young minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, who has since become chancellor at the head of a majority coalition government of the ÖVP and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to last a full five-year term.
The inclusion of the FPÖ in the government will not lead to significant tensions with other EU member states as it did in 2000, when the party was last part of a coalition. This is largely because of the normalisation of the far right in Europe since then.
The new government will focus on integration and immigration policy, including by taking a prominent role on this issue within the EU. It will attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and introduce some additional flexibility in labour and product markets. Significant structural reforms are unlikely, owing to low government cohesion.
We forecast that the government budget will remain in deficit-albeit well within the EU-mandated limit of 3% of GDP-throughout the 2018-22 forecast period, as the fiscal consolidation process is likely to be restrained by limited government cohesion and effectiveness. The public debt/GDP ratio will fall gradually, to 67.6% by 2022, from 78.2% in 2017.
After several years of underperformance compared with its regional peers, the economy has performed relatively strongly since the start of 2016, growing by 3.2% in 2017. We forecast a continuation of strong growth this year, at an upwardly revised 2.9%, and for growth to moderate to 1.7% on average in 2019-22.
Consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) will continue to exceed the euro zone average in 2018-22, driven by structural domestic factors, including higher unit wage costs and more regulated markets. We expect annual average EU harmonised inflation of 2% in 2018-22.
The current-account surplus has been relatively stable in recent years. Although we expect small changes in the composition of the surplus, we expect it to remain broadly stable, at 1.8% of GDP on average in 2018-22, driven mainly by a strong surplus on the services balance, supported by tourism inflows.

Austria's business environment score rises between the historical period (2013-17) and the forecast period (2018-22), mainly owing to the improving economy. Austria's strengths as a business location include good infrastructure, stable institutions and co-operative labour relations, but high taxes, limited market opportunities and restrictive regulations will persist.
Country forecast overview: Austria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government works on reducing red tape, but progress is likely to be limited.
2020-22: Modest strengthening of competition authority's powers. Administrative reform reduces red tape. More transparency in antitrust proceedings. Risk of political interference in private firms in which state owns substantial stakes.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Foreign investment is generally welcome, but underlying opposition to takeovers of "national champions" persists.
2020-22: Possible erosion of barriers against foreign takeovers as a result of commercial pressure and EU legislation.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: No exchange controls. Foreign trade, governed by EU rules, should remain liberal. Risk of disruption, owing to trade dispute between the EU and the US.
2020-22: EU maintains focus on bilateral free-trade agreements as multilateral trade negotiations stagnate.
Taxes
2018-19: Limited changes to the tax system aimed at reducing the sizeable income tax wedge.
2020-22: Vested interests will continue to hamper large-scale reform, and the high tax burden will remain.
Financing
2018-19: Financial stability to improve amid tighter regulatory requirements and a reduction in risk from exposure to central and eastern Europe.
2020-22: Further uptake in corporate bond issuance. Credit conditions continue to ease as banks' profitability recovers, in part supported by a gradual uptick in interest rates.
The labour market
2018-19: Economy-wide minimum wage introduced. More stringent requirements for early retirement and invalidity pensions. Labour market slowly improves as increase in labour supply moderates and unemployment continues to fall.
2020-22: Continued modest expansion of labour supply, primarily via net immigration, but concerns about shortage of skilled employees in certain sectors are likely to persist. Early retirement phased out.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Further take-up of broadband services. Gradual improvement of transport links with eastern Europe.
2020-22: Improved transport network connecting main urban centres and providing better access to the country's interior.
Technological readiness
2018-19: Internet use remains slightly below several regional peers, but research and development remains relatively high.
2020-22: Further progress made on upgrading the large manufacturing sector to take advantage of new technologies.

Background: Austria became an important force in central Europe with the formation of the Habsburg empire in the 15th century and remained so until the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the first world war. The Republic of Austria emerged in 1918. In 1938 Austria was incorporated into the German Third Reich. With the departure of the victorious Allied forces in 1955, it regained independence as a neutral country. In the post-war period Austria took great strides to catch up economically with the rest of the developed world and is now one of the most advanced nations. It is a member of the EU and a participant in economic and monetary union (EMU).
Political structure: Austria is a federal republic, and the head of state is the federal president. The government is led by the federal chancellor. The national parliament has two houses: the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house), of 62 members appointed by state parliaments, and the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house), which has 183 members elected by proportional representation. An early general election was held on October 15th 2017.
Policy issues: The government will focus on migration and integration issues, including in the EU context. It will also attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and implement other measures to improve the business environment, including through enabling more flexibility in the labour market.
Taxation: Austrian labour tax as a percentage of GDP is among the highest in the EU. A 2016 tax reform lowered the tax burden for low- and middle-income earners, but raised the top personal income tax rate from 50% to 55%. Social security contributions, shared between employers and employees, are high. Corporation tax is levied at a rate of 25%. Dividend and investment income is subject to a withholding tax of 27.5%. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a standard rate of 20%, and a reduced rate of 13% (raised from 10% in 2016) applies for certain goods and services.
Foreign trade: Trade relations are dominated by Germany, which accounts for about one-third of total imports and exports. The current-account surplus is driven by strong tourism exports boosting the services surplus. We expect modest current-account surpluses throughout the forecast period.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
The governing coalition consists of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). The Economist Intelligence Unit expects this coalition to prove relatively stable and to sit out its full term until 2022. This follows several years of little progress on reforms and coalition (as well as party) in-fighting under the grand coalition of the ÖVP and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ), which fell apart in May 2017. The popular 31-year-old minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, took over the leadership of the ÖVP, reformed the party around himself, and moved it closer to the FPÖ on issues such as immigration and integration. As a result, he led the ÖVP to a plurality of the vote in the early election in October last year, winning a 31.5% share-up by 7.5 percentage points on the party's result in 2013. The SPÖ's share was unchanged, at 26.9%. The FPÖ increased its share of the vote by 5.5 percentage points, to 26%. The liberal NEOS returned to parliament with just over 5%, and the Greens failed to cross the 4% electoral threshold for the first time in 31 years, in part because List Pilz, led by a former leader of the Greens, narrowly managed to cross it.
In mid-December, after just over a month and a half of negotiations, the ÖVP and the FPÖ formed a coalition. Under Mr Kurz, the ÖVP has moved closer to the FPÖ in many policy areas, and the negotiations therefore went relatively smoothly. To assuage concerns from Mr Kurz and the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, about the FPÖ's previous Euroscepticism, the party has agreed not to push for a referendum on EU membership. Moreover, EU policy is handled by the chancellery instead of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is headed by an FPÖ appointee.
The chancellor is from the ÖVP, but the election was nevertheless a decisive moment in the fraying of the decades-long dominance of the political scene by the SPÖ and the ÖVP, as the ÖVP has, to a large extent, been replaced by Mr Kurz's new movement. The two parties had together ruled the country almost continuously since 1945, but a renewed grand coalition had become almost impossible following a breakdown in relations and the reform gridlock in recent years. The FPÖ has profited from this and from concerns about immigration, although Mr Kurz also owes much of his popularity to his strong stance on this issue, and his plans to curtail migration into Europe and Austria.
Despite the overlap between the ÖVP's and the FPÖ's programmes, we do not expect the government to implement significant structural reforms, as the coalition partners are likely to disagree on economic matters, on which they are significantly less well aligned than they are on social and cultural matters. In addition, the FPÖ could struggle to translate its opposition stance on topics such as immigration and integration into firm policy proposals. The initial phase of the government's term is likely to be relatively smooth, owing in part to the country's role as president of the Council of the European Union until the end of 2018. Later in the term, the FPÖ might struggle to distinguish itself from the ÖVP, which could lead to tensions between the parties, creating a moderate risk of an early election.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
The most recent general election was held on October 15th 2017. We expect the government to remain in office until the end of its term, which ends in late 2022, maintaining its majority in the Nationalrat (the lower house of parliament). There is a risk of an early election, although we believe that the probability of a snap vote is small. The next election for the, primarily ceremonial, post of federal president will be in 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Austria was severely affected by the European migrant crisis, and this has been the dominant issue in its domestic politics and international relations since 2015. The country has been at the centre of many of the intra-EU spats regarding the bloc's response to the large influx of migrants. Domestic pressure on the government to be seen as acting against this inflow, and thus often against other EU member states, will remain high. The new government plans to cut child benefit payments flowing abroad, potentially leading to tensions with eastern member states in particular.
Nevertheless, Mr Kurz has been at pains to point out that his government will be pro-EU, and that Austria's EU membership will not be questioned in the coming years. The government intends Austria to be a leading voice in the bloc, especially on migration reform, which should be facilitated by the country's role as president of the Council of the European Union. We expect the government to move forward with proposals such as tighter controls of the EU's outer borders and processing asylum applications outside the EU.
Although the previous inclusion of the FPÖ into government, in 2000, led to sanctions being imposed by other EU nations, the reception has been more muted this time. In that period, a far-right nationalist party entering government was an unusual development, but since then sister parties to the FPÖ have either entered government or supported minority governments in several EU countries, including some Nordic countries and the Netherlands. However, this will, at times, lead to tensions with fellow EU members, as shown by the fact that a number of countries are now sharing less intelligence with Austria because the ministries concerned are headed by the FPÖ.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
The new government plans to move integration and immigration policy further to the right, including through curtailing benefits for asylum-seekers and cutting child benefits that are sent abroad. It has also presented plans that focus on improving the business environment, including by reducing corporate tax rates and introducing more flexible working hours. Furthermore, it plans to cut a number of labour market programmes aimed at the long-term unemployed and integrating migrants into the labour market. Although it has announced a push to centralise and streamline the welfare system-to which several major stakeholders, including state governors, are likely to object-it does not plan to reform the so-called Proporz system, under which the ÖVP and the SPÖ had apportioned public entities and functions (state companies, public services, subsidies and regulatory responsibilities). This is despite suggestions from both coalition parties-especially the FPÖ-in the past that they would want to do this. We therefore expect reform momentum to be limited and that the government will struggle to implement significant structural reforms rapidly.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Driven by both a lacklustre recovery following the financial and euro zone crises and a lack of fiscal consolidation, the fiscal accounts have remained in modest deficit in recent years and within the 3% of GDP limit set by the EU. Strong growth contributed to a narrowing of the deficit to 0.7% of GDP in 2017.
The government plans to achieve a small budget surplus in 2019 by cutting spending, and through reducing income taxes and the country's sizeable tax wedge. However, it has not yet clearly outlined the spending cuts that it intends to make, barring a number of smaller measures, including cutting spending on asylum-seekers, and we therefore do not share the government's optimism that a surplus can be reached in 2019. Nevertheless, continued robust economic growth will contribute to a further narrowing of the deficit in the coming years; we expect it to average 0.4% of GDP in 2018-22.
The public debt stock as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline gradually, from 78.2% in 2017 to 67.6% in 2022. Although the public finances will remain worse than in countries such as Germany or the Netherlands, the low interest-rate environment and Austria's relatively strong fundamentals mean that funding risks are extremely low, in our view.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The European Central Bank (ECB) is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a quantitative easing (QE) programme that is running at EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018. The programme will run at EUR15bn per month in October-December before coming to an end. Economic activity in the euro zone has softened in early 2018, but the ECB's view of the outlook remains fairly positive. Rising commodity prices and evidence of building domestic price pressure in some parts of the euro zone should mean that sufficient inflationary pressures will begin to emerge on the policy horizon in 2019-20. In response, we expect the ECB to take steps towards normalising its policy stance with an increase of 25 basis points in the main refinancing rate, to 0.25%, in early 2020, followed by five more rises that lift the main refinancing rate to 1.5% by end-2022. An increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019, easing the pressure on banks' lending margins and supporting profitability.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Austria's initial recovery from the global financial crisis was respectable in the euro zone context, but the economy subsequently stalled and underperformed compared with regional peers, notably Germany. This was particularly striking, given the traditionally high level of synchronisation between the two countries' business cycles. A faltering reform process in recent years contributed to higher inflation compared with regional peers, and weakened productivity growth, admittedly from fairly high levels. However, the economic recovery gained significant momentum from the second half of 2016. Although, in previous years, the labour market had struggled to integrate the significant increase in the labour force, it seemed to have turned a corner in late 2016 and early 2017, owing in part to a surge in employment in the manufacturing sector. We expect a continued gradual improvement in labour market indicators in the coming years. This is supporting private consumption, which we expect to grow by 1.8% this year. Export and investment growth have also picked up. As a result, real GDP growth was 3.2% in 2017-above the level in Germany for the first time since 2005, and Austria's fastest growth rate since 2007.
We expect the current phase of catch-up growth-after an underperformance compared with fundamentals in recent years-to continue this year, although we forecast slower real GDP growth, of 2.9%, as we expect the impulse from the manufacturing sector in 2017 to have largely been a one-off. Nevertheless, increasing labour shortages will contribute to business investment pushing up investment growth in the first half of our five-year forecast period. Driven by the improvement of the labour market, domestic demand will be the main driver of growth. In the following years we expect a further moderation of growth, to 1.6% on average in 2020-22, around the economy's potential growth rate. Government policy is likely to be supportive of growth in the coming years, and the main risks are external. As a highly open economy, Austria is vulnerable to global economic developments. We expect the impact of the trade dispute between the EU and the US to be limited for Austria. However, an escalation beyond one more round of mutual tariff imposition, including on automotive imports by the US, continues to pose a significant downside risk to the outlook.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Annual consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) has been subdued in recent years, but higher than in most other euro zone countries. Inflation averaged 0.9% in 2015-16-well above average inflation in Germany and the euro zone. This largely reflects structural domestic factors, such as higher unit wage costs, more regulated markets, and a period of faster increases in taxes and duties. Rising services prices and energy price base effects caused a gradual increase in inflation in 2017, leading to a full-year average of 2.2%. The recent strengthening of the euro will weigh slightly on inflation, but we expect price growth to stay above the euro zone average in 2018-22, at 2% on average, as similar structural factors seen in previous years persist.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
For most of 2015-16 the euro moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1, before a sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following the US presidential election led to a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1 in 2016. However, in 2017 the euro rallied as the region's economic recovery strengthened and expectations of QE tapering increased, and as political risk waned in Europe but rose in the US. The exchange rate peaked at almost US$1.25:EUR1 at the beginning of February 2018 but had weakened to US$1.16:EUR1 by late May in response to formation of a populist, Eurosceptic government in Italy, and remained close to that level in June. The value of the euro could yet come under further pressure from political risk in Italy, and also from monetary tightening in the US. Nevertheless, we expect a broad stabilisation on average, at US$1.21:EUR1 in 2018-21, as the euro is supported by an ongoing recovery in the region and receives structural support from a large current-account surplus, while the business cycle downturn in the US will weigh on the value of the dollar in 2020. Thereafter, we expect the euro to appreciate to US$1.24:EUR1 on average in 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
Low oil prices and subdued domestic demand compressing import values have helped the trade balance to move into surplus in recent years, from a deficit in 2009-13. However, the increase in oil prices in 2017 pushed it back into a modest deficit. We expect the trade account to remain slightly in deficit throughout the forecast period. The main driver of the current-account surplus will therefore be the healthy surplus on the services balance, driven in large part by robust tourist inflows. This will ensure that the current-account surplus remains broadly unchanged throughout 2018-22, at 1.8% of GDP on average.

Abstract: In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly. [...]wastefulness at state-owned firms and massive corruption and clientelism schemes built around the delivery of subsidised goods and services would be hard to roll back without antagonising government backers, risking political instability. [...]we would expect a mixed administration to focus on macroeconomic essentials, such as the stabilisation of the currency and local prices, and tackling mismanagement of PDVSA. [...]we expect extremely limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will limit economic recovery and fuel continued unrest. Owing to the need to maintain political stability, we do not expect the closure of the various handout programmes in operation, nor the removal of utility subsidies or the reformation of inefficient state-owned firms. [...]we expect public expenditure to be hard to reduce; we expect the deficit to be substantial throughout the 2018-22 period, ending 2022 at 6.8% GDP.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Economic collapse and the erosion of the patronage scheme supporting the president, Nicolás Maduro, put the ruling regime's internal cohesion in jeopardy. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a traumatic rift that will end in regime pragmatists allowing opposition participation in a "mixed admin-istration" as a way to remain in power from 2019 onwards. There is a risk that the regime will retain cohesion and cling to power beyond 2019 if it finds financing to meet its debt obligations and boost dwindling oil production.
We estimate that inflation exceeded 2,000% at the end of 2017 and will average over 10,000% in 2018. GDP will continue to contract in 2018-20. High inflation has led to a collapse in private consumption, and difficult operating conditions have hurt investment. Following a change in policy under a new government, we expect economic growth to resume in 2021.
The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. From 2019 a new government will stabilise the economy, but the wholesale rethink of the institutional framework needed to restore investment and confidence is unlikely.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and quadruple-digit inflation will hit private consumption, and an increasingly difficult operating environment will accentuate a fall in fixed investment. The recession that began in 2014 will continue to deepen despite a partial recovery in oil prices, and the economy will not return to growth until 2021-assuming that a new government takes power and implements reforms. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
US dollar measurements of Venezuela's market size provide an overly positive picture of the economy, given the marked overvaluation of the fixed exchange rate. In reality, recession and extremely high inflation (driven by shortages of foreign exchange and basic goods) will continue to restrict purchasing power. After 2020, under a new government, we expect purchasing power and the business environment to improve.

Venezuela is in 82th position globally in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings, making it the least attractive investment location in the world. This reflects the highly heterodox macroeconomic policies of an authoritarian government, a lack of legal security and weak institutions.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government persists with bias against free markets and ad hoc recourse to heterodox measures. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition. Property rights remain weak.
2020-22: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Access to project financing is difficult and uncertainty over contractual rights persists.
2020-22: Efforts to attract foreign investment gather pace under a new government, although actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2018-19: Opaque currency controls add to uncertainty, severely restrict private-sector access to foreign exchange and impede trade. New government in 2019 starts removing exchange controls.
2020-22: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2018-19: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite the huge fiscal deficit. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2020-22: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2018-19: Amid severely high inflation, financing remains only available in the short term and banking sector shrinks in real terms.
2020-22: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2018-19: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. An ongoing freeze on redundancies, combined with a large informal sector and skill shortages, makes the labour market exceptionally rigid.
2020-22: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Underinvestment in the water and electricity grid ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2020-22: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued water and electricity rationing
Technological readiness
2018-19: E-government services remain almost non-existent and deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies.
2020-22: Limited regulator capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has plummeted as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices has plunged the country into a massive economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded republican institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is how to stabilise an economy mired in a years-long economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. At the same time, mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign-exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Using IMF data, The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$21.1bn in 2017 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages. We estimate the current-account surplus at 1.3% of GDP that year.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
Despite a decimated economy and spiralling hyperinflation, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) and the president, Nicolás Maduro, retain their hold on power. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects worsening economic conditions to result in a chaotic political transition, most likely ushering in a government with nominal opposition participation-a "mixed administration"-in 2019.
The opposition, of which the Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD) is the biggest grouping, remains in disarray. Apart from infighting, this reflects the PSUV's systematic campaign to disfranchise opposition parties and sideline them from state institutions. After years of ineffectual leadership, most citizens, even those opposing the PSUV, distrust opposition parties. This has left them incapable of channelling the anti-government sentiment brewing in response to the country's dire economic situation.
In this context of unrest and repression, the PSUV is increasingly dependent on the military for support. The country is run by civic-military alliance and a network of businessmen that enjoy military or political connections. The accord is sustained by opportunities for arbitrage and corruption made possible by foreign-exchange controls; subsidised imports of basic goods; and control of large and inefficient public-sector companies. Within this opaque arrangement, factions are primarily explained by personal and patronage ties, which mean that different civic-military factions coexist within the regime. The ultimate source of resources flowing through this patronage system is PDVSA, the state-owned oil company, whose exports account for the vast majority of foreign-exchange inflows.
Jeopardising the arrangement is a rapid decline in oil production due to mismanagement and underinvestment. Resultant strains have been highlighted by purges of the military, the latest coming in March. Furthermore, in June Mr Maduro reshuffled key positions in the administration, giving increased power to Diosdado Cabello, a long-time internal rival who has extensive military and business ties; Mr Cabello will now lead the Constituent Assembly (ANC, the country's de facto legislature). We interpret this as Mr Maduro attempting to regain internal support, even at the expense of personal power. Mr Cabello is a leading figure in the regime, but other factions within the PSUV also exist. Unless the administration turns PDVSA around (we see this as unlikely, as the government lacks the required expertise or financing), we believe that the patronage system supporting Mr Maduro will be at risk of collapse by 2019.
Internal fracture in the regime may happen earlier than 2019, as the secular trend towards lower oil output may be hastened by sanctions on oil trade by the US, PDVSA's largest cash-paying market. Following Mr Maduro's victory in an internationally repudiated presidential election on May 20th, the US rolled out sanctions designed to complicate PDVSA's exports. Similarly, PDVSA's unpaid debts may lead to asset seizures that impede trade. In May ConocoPhillips, a US firm pursuing collection of an arbitration award, seized PDVSA's infrastructure in the Caribbean, disrupting exports. The parties are reportedly negotiating an agreement and some seizures have been reversed, but if such measures become commonplace and/or reach Citgo, PDVSA's US subsidiary, exports could be disrupted indefinitely.
Regardless of the timing, what happens following the internal fracture is hard to predict. The transition is likely to be violent. The PSUV's internal stability is a concern, as the end of the current set-up is likely to unleash jostling for position between the PSUV's varied civic-military factions. If no faction secures sufficient internal consensus, a period of chaos of indeterminate duration may ensue. Alternatively, the regime may reconfigure itself, with an outright military government or PSUV civilian figureheads fronting a military-heavy admin-istration. Such administrations would probably look to Russia and China, erstwhile backers, for aid to stabilise both the economy and PDVSA. However, we believe that the required financing-tens of billions of US dollars per year-is beyond Russia's means. China has scaled back its relations with Venezuela since 2015. Given that the regime's raison d'etre is the enrichment of its members, stabilisation of PDVSA and the economy would be likely to take priority under a new government, and we would expect regime pragmatists to seek western assistance-specifically from multilaterals and governments. As these financiers will demand democratic reforms, we believe that the most likely outcome is a "mixed administration", in which pragmatically minded military and PSUV leaders allow opposition participation as a way of gaining inter-national legitimacy. Given past behaviour, there should be no shortage of opposition figures willing to participate.
The main risk to our baseline view is that regime pragmatists will be unable to convince other regime members of the benefit of this arrangement. Democratic reforms that western lenders would insist on may not be acceptable to some PSUV figures. Similarly, foreign financing would underpin a macroeconomic programme that-by eliminating the economy's distortions-would close avenues for corruption and upset regime insiders. Other hurdles of uncertain size will remain. These include the judiciary, the ANC and violent extremist supporters of the current regime known as colectivos.
Overall, we expect a chaotic transition starting in late 2018 or early 2019. The process will be highly uncertain and may feature several false starts. We expect curtailed political stability in 2019-22.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
Mr Maduro comfortably won re-election on May 20th. However, voter turnout was exceedingly low, at 46%, denting his legitimacy and introducing questions about the regime's actual control of the population. (The PSUV's turn-out-the-vote operation uses a combination of ideological affinity and coercive tactics.) We do not expect free and fair elections in the short term. Based on our assumption of a new government comprised of government and opposition pragmatists, an electoral timetable may be announced, as international financing will almost certainly come with demands for democratic reforms.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Most regional governments have denounced the Venezuelan government, as has the EU. The most effective sanctions have come from the US, which has instituted country-level sanctions that deny Venezuela the possibility of refinancing its debts. Sanctions banning the oil trade outright are not part of our baseline assumption, but a hawkish US foreign policy team increases the risk of this happening. A key priority for the Maduro administration will be the maintenance of good relations with Russia and China. Both have provided financing in the past, but seem unwilling to provide the several billions of dollars needed to stem the decline of oil output.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
The government remains unable and unwilling to undertake the policy changes needed to address its main challenges, namely declining oil production, hyperinflation and mounting arrears on external debt. Most sovereign and state-owned firms' bonds (including those of PDVSA) are now in arrears. The government has called for debt restructuring, but it appears impossible, owing to US financial sanctions and, more fundamentally, because the government lacks a credible economic programme. There is no sign yet of lawsuits by bondholders, who so far appear to prefer the promise of late payment to lengthy legal battles. Investors may also be waiting for news of policy changes following the May election or a change in leadership. In the meantime, both the sovereign and PDVSA are open to legal challenges in the US. Such seizures could hit exports, the regime's economic lifeline.
In the meantime, the government must grapple with a severe economic crisis. Monetisation of large public deficits and dwindling exports have led to foreign currency rationing and hyper-inflation. The government has devalued the official exchange rate, but monetary imbal-ances persist and foreign-exchange continues to be rationed. Economic policy will remain interventionist in the short term, deepening the economic crisis that drives our baseline forecast of a move towards a mixed administration.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect more orthodox economic policies to be implemented. However, the administration will face considerable internal limitations in addressing key policy challenges. For example, wastefulness at state-owned firms and massive corruption and clientelism schemes built around the delivery of subsidised goods and services would be hard to roll back without antagonising government backers, risking political instability. Thus, we would expect a mixed administration to focus on macroeconomic essentials, such as the stabilisation of the currency and local prices, and tackling mismanagement of PDVSA.
Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and multilaterals (totalling US$19bn in 2019-22) and the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. Internal cohesiveness in the mixed administration will be key, as the PSUV is ideologically opposed to such borrowing and multilateral financing is likely to come with conditions on democratic reforms. Meanwhile, PDVSA must open itself to foreign investment to secure the finance needed to bring output back on track. This will require considerable political capital, as it would imply a wholesale revision of the sector's institutional framework. Pockets of resistance are likely to exist. Internal stability within the PSUV will remain a major risk to our forecast, as the success of a mixed administration would depend on PSUV pragmatists fending off more radical party members, who would oppose accepting international assistance and reforming policy.
Outside of these areas, we do not expect much success in rolling back the PSUV's strong interventionist bent in the economy. As a result, we expect extremely limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will limit economic recovery and fuel continued unrest.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Authorities have not published data on fiscal accounts since 2011, when the non-financial public-sector (NFPS) deficit was 12% of GDP. We forecast an NFPS deficit of 15.5% of GDP in 2018, which will largely be financed by printing money. High inflation and the overvalued official exchange rate make debt/GDP ratios misleading indicators of fiscal stability. Considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) understates the true size of total public liabilities.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect a restructuring with external creditors in 2020. Owing to the need to maintain political stability, we do not expect the closure of the various handout programmes in operation, nor the removal of utility subsidies or the reformation of inefficient state-owned firms. Therefore, we expect public expenditure to be hard to reduce; we expect the deficit to be substantial throughout the 2018-22 period, ending 2022 at 6.8% GDP.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (the central bank) to print money. At the end of May M2 increased by 6,297% year on year. The government has not announced any change in policy other than planning to take three zeroes off the currency. However, the plan has been put on hold for logistical reasons. We expect a new administration to place a much greater emphasis on tackling hyperinflation, and expect a substantial monetary adjustment in the context of a macroeconomic stabilisation plan.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Amid ongoing disruption to Venezuela's productive base and a collapse in consumer spending, we project further contractions in real GDP in 2018-20, following an estimated contraction of 13.9% in 2017. Our forecast recovery in 2021-22 rests on the assumption of a political transition that, supported by IMF financial and institutional assistance, produces a credible macroeconomic programme with improved management of the country's oil wealth at its centre. However, the reform programme will be limited in scope by a weak government, and we only expect a partial rebound in real GDP, following a decline of over 50% in 2013-20.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2018, reflecting the effect on real wages of hyperinflation as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will continue to contract as well, reflecting the difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. Our forecast for a recovery in investment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition and a pick-up in investment in the oil sector. Oil output-already in the midst of a long decline owing to mismanagement and underinvestment-has contracted beyond expectations in recent months; we now expect it to bottom out at 1.2m barrels/day (b/d) in early 2020, down from an average of 1.95m b/d in 2017. Under our baseline forecast of openness to foreign investment under a new government from around 2019, oil production will start a recovery in the second half of 2020, but will remain well below 2m b/d even at the end of our forecast period in 2022. Export volumes will only start to recover in 2021, as an increase in domestic demand, which has been artificially constrained, will initially absorb the increase in oil output. For the same reason, import demand will rise sharply.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
A decimation of domestic supply, severe limits on imports and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official data have not been published since 2015, but the opposition-led National Assembly has estimated that monthly inflation was 80% in April, bringing year-on-year inflation to over 13,000%. We expect inflation to average over 10,000% in 2018. There is a high risk of a hyperinflationary spiral in coming months that increases inflation to well above our current forecast and necessitates a dramatic adjustment, probably involving a resort to currency substitution.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
Since the start of the year the government has devalued the official exchange rate by over 95%. The rate is supposedly determined by an auction system, but the government-which mono-polises the country's exports-has not supplied the system with foreign-exchange, making the system unsustainable and access to foreign exchange practically impossible, even at the current rates. In late June the black-market exchange rate was around BsF2,600,000:US$1; the official rate stood at BsF96,000:US$1.
Given existing distortions in the foreign-exchange market and growing hyperinflation, the government may, as part of a stabilisation plan, introduce a new domestic currency or attempt some kind of currency substitution in the future. Under our current political assumptions, similar measures may be undertaken after 2019. The exact nature and implementation of the plan is hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
We expect the current-account surplus to reach US$5.6bn in 2018 (2.4% of GDP at the distorted exchange rate, which overstates the GDP in dollar terms), owing to continued import compression. However, Venezuela's lack of access to foreign finance means that the current-account surplus will not be enough to meet the country's financing needs. Indeed, excluding arrears, we calculate that principal repayments of sovereign and state-owned companies' bonded debt alone will amount to US$3.5bn in 2018. As such, we expect further arrears in 2018 and 2019. By 2020, with a new government in power, we expect that-following a debt renegotiation-external financing will be restored and imports will begin a recovery. We expect the surge in imports to tip the current account into a deficit of 6.2% of GDP in 2020 at a less highly distorted exchange rate. The restructured interest payment schedule will mean lower outflows, but the slow recovery of the oil sector and years of unmet import demand will mean that the current-account deficit will remain high, at over 4.5% of GDP in 2021-22.
Assuming that a new administration takes power from around 2019, we expect financial and investment inflows to provide sufficient financing, stabilise balance-of-payments dynamics and help to rebuild reserves coverage. However, there are considerable risks to this rosy outlook. In addition to assuming a pragmatic unity government capable of retaining power, it hinges on a substantial assistance package from the IMF, the quick implementation of a successful macroeconomic stabilisation package, the fast resolution of a debt renegotiation process in 2019-20, substantial inflows of financial and real investment into the economy in 2020-22, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

Abstract: The PJ's divisions have until now worked in the government's favour, allowing the government to pursue its legislative agenda with the support of moderate Peronists. [...]Mr Macri has remained relatively popular, with voters giving him the benefit of the doubt on the need for economic adjustment. According to our baseline forecast, this will happen towards the end of 2020. [...]at end-2017 the real effective exchange rate was 14% stronger than the average of the previous 20 years. 2013a 2014a 2015b 2016b 2017b 2018c 2019c 2020c 2021c 2022c The labour market (av) Labour force (m) 11.8 11.9b 12.0 12.5 12.6 12.7 12.9 13.1 13.3 13.5 Labour force (% change) 0.8 1.1b 0.3 4.3 1.2 0.8 1.3 1.4 1.4 1.4 Unemployment rate (%) 7.1 7.3 6.5 8.5 8.4a 8.8 8.5 8.4 8.4 8.4 Wage and price inflation (% except labour costs per hour) Consumer prices (av) 23.4 38.1 26.5a 41.4a 26.5a 28.2 18.5 12.0 8.7 6.1 Consumer prices (year-end) 26.0 38.0 26.9a 41.0a 24.8a 27.2 14.8 9.9 7.1 5.9 Producer prices (av) 14.9 26.5 11.9a 37.2a 16.1a 39.7 17.5 9.8 7.1 5.4 GDP deflator (av) 23.9 40.2 26.6a 40.0a 25.4a 30.0 20.3 10.4 6.9 5.7 Private consumption deflator (av) 24.6 41.8 26.4a 38.9a 24.4a 34.5 21.8 9.8 6.6 5.6 Government consumption deflator (av) 21.5 33.9 29.8a 36.7a 27.5a 28.2 18.5 12.0 8.7 6.1 Fixed investment deflator (av) 27.4 44.0 22.3a 35.9a 17.5a 34.5 21.8 9.8 6.6 5.6 Average nominal wages 25.1 32.8 30.3 28.3 29.5 26.9 17.5 10.3 7.7 7.2 Average real wages 1.3 -3.8 3.0 -9.3 2.4 -1.0 -0.9 -1.6 -0.9 1.0 Unit labour costs (Ps-based; av) 23.2b 37.5b 29.3 34.5 28.6 27.3 17.0 10.0 6.7 6.0 Unit labour costs (US$-based) 2.4b -7.0b 13.1 -15.9 14.6 -15.1 -3.7 0.8 -0.9 0.5 Labour costs per hour (Ps) 31.6b 42.0b 54.8 70.3 91.0 115.5 135.7 149.6 161.2 172.8 Labour costs per hour (US$) 5.8b 5.2b 5.9 4.8 5.5 4.6 4.5 4.5 4.5 4.6 a Actual.b Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.c Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The ruling centre-right Cambiemos coalition government is under increasing political pressure amid recent currency volatility and an IMF bailout (the Fund is unpopular in Argentina), but will be hoping to get its policy agenda back on track in time for the presidential election, when the president, Mauricio Macri, will seek a second term. However, the opposition will increasingly obstruct policy. Cambiemos lacks a congressional majority, meaning that the administration has to negotiate support for its legislative agenda on an ad hoc basis with various factions of Argentina's dominant Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party).
Currency depreciation pressure amid an emerging-market sell-off has introduced substantial political uncertainty, but major changes to economic policymaking are not envisaged under the terms of the IMF lending arrangement, other than a more rapid tightening of fiscal policy. The US$50bn stand-by arrangement was approved on June 20th and includes targets for a tightening of fiscal policy to produce a primary fiscal balance by 2020 (in order to contain growth in the public debt/GDP ratio and reduce inflationary deficit financing), and provisions for central-bank target independence to be enshrined in law, to help to tackle the inflation problem (the root of Argentina's external competitiveness problem, which is in turn driving devaluation pressures). The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that programme targets will be met, and will gradually reduce inflation and engender macro-economic stability over time.
A spike in interest rates and a tightening of fiscal policy amid currency pressures will weigh on economic activity, and we have revised our forecast for real GDP growth in 2018 to 0.8%, down from 1.6% previously. For now, our view of medium-term GDP growth remains broadly unchanged, although the risks to our forecasts have risen substantially. Under our benign baseline forecast, we expect growth to fluctuate around 3% in 2020-22.
More front-loaded currency weakening than previously projected will provide some boost to external competitiveness, but even so, the current-account deficit will remain large in 2018, and import cover will dip from 7.6 months to around seven months this year. Thereafter, we expect the current-account deficit to narrow steadily to below 3% of GDP in 2022.
Argentina's GDP per head is among the highest in the region and, combined with improved access to credit, moderate rates of economic growth in the medium term will boost purchasing power and create market opportunities. Still-high poverty rates and income inequality will restrict the pool of consumers, but to a lesser extent than in many other countries in the region

Argentina's global business environment score improves in 2018-22, and the country jumps 12 places in The Economist Intelligence Unit's global ranking. Economic policy adjustment is under way as the government works to tighten macro-economic policy, reduce state intervention in the private sector and encourage private investment. But in many areas improvements will take time to materialise.
Country forecast overview: Argentina's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: The administration of Mauricio Macri works to address key weaknesses, including weak competition policy, the heavy burden of red tape and restrictive price controls.
2020-22: Continued work to build faith in legal and regulatory frameworks. State participation in key sectors continues.
Policy toward foreign investment
2018-19: Proactive, welcoming approach to foreign investment. Attempts to resolve outstanding disputes with creditors.
2020-22: Foreign direct investment is welcome. Improvement made in investment dispute settlement and availability of investment-protection schemes.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Continued efforts to improve the workings of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union) and develop closer relations with the Pacific Alliance, comprising Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.
2020-22: Possibility that new free-trade agreements are signed with the EU and Canada.
Taxes
2018-19: Further gradual reductions of export taxes to encourage domestic supply. Tax reforms to promote investment and reduce tax pressure.
2020-22: Comprehensive tax reform to improve federal-provincial revenue sharing a possibility, but obstacles to reform persist. System remains complex, despite recent reforms.
Financing
2018-19: Banking penetration remains weak and long-term credit restricted, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, owing to weak long-term deposit base.
2020-22: Non-bank financing grows, but is constrained by a relatively small pool of institutional investors.
The labour market
2018-19: Tension with unions, owing to inflation. Political and bargaining power of unions remains strong.
2020-22: Limited progress on labour reform. Continued potential for conflicts with unions. Some skills shortages.
Infrastructure
2018-19: The Macri administration continues to improve contract rights and deficient regulatory regimes.
2020-22: Some public and private investment set to improve energy supply and upgrade export infrastructure, but the risk of energy shortages will persist as demand grows.
Technological readiness
2018-19: Quality of e-commerce business environment is good. Upgrade of 4G capabilities.
2020-22: More progress on increasing scope of e-government as part of process to reduce red tape. Increase in research and development spending as percentage of GDP, but still relatively low compared with more developed markets.

Background: Democracy was restored to Argentina in 1983, after 50 years of instability and military regimes. Economic liberalisation in the 1990s drove firm growth, but an inflexible exchange-rate mechanism and fail-ure to deepen structural reform left the economy vulnerable to shocks, contributing to the collapse in 2001 of Fernando de la Rúa's centre-left government. An interim government took power until Néstor Kirchner of the Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party) began a term in 2003. He presided over an economic rebound, which enabled his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, to win the presidency in 2007 and secure re-election in 2011. Economic policy mismanage-ment drove a change of government in 2015, with a centre-right candidate, Mauricio Macri, taking office in December 2015.
Political structure: A strong presidential system is in theory checked by a bicameral Congress, comprising a 257-member Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and a 72-member Senate (the upper house); in practice, however, the presidency dominates. The presidential term is four years. There are 23 provinces and the Buenos Aires federal district, each with its own government.
Policy issues: Pro-cyclical expansionary policies and the commodity supercycle contributed to GDP growth of an annual average 6.6% in 2005-11. But expansionary policy also produced significant imbalances. Amid currency pressures, the Fernández government resorted to controls and ad hoc interventionism, to the detriment of the business environment. These policies did not reduce devaluation speculation, and left the economy extremely vulnerable to currency crisis. Macroeconomic adjustments to try to reduce economic distortions are taking place under Mr Macri; these include the shift to a free float at the end of 2015, fiscal and monetary tightening, and reforms to boost domestic supply, but the pace of adjustment has been insufficient to prevent severe currency pressure, and in mid-2018 the government was forced to turn to the IMF for a stand-by lending arrangement involving tighter fiscal targets.
Taxation: The value-added tax (VAT) rate is 21%, although VAT on some goods and services is charged at a lower rate of 10.5%, and some services are taxed at a higher rate of 27%. Corporate income tax is levied at 35%, and personal income tax at progressive rates between 9% and 35%. Under a tax reform approved at end-2017, the corporate income tax rate will fall to 30% in 2019 and 25% in 2021. There is a 0.6% tax on financial transactions (deposits and withdrawals).
Foreign trade: The current account moved from surplus to deficit in 2010. By 2017 the deficit had widened to 4.8% of GDP.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
Argentina was hit hard by an emerging-market sell-off in May, and although turbulence in the foreign-exchange market has subsided with the announce-ment of a US$50bn IMF stand-by lending arrangement, recent developments could have lasting political consequences for the government. The Fund is supportive of Argentina, and The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect dramatic changes in the course of economic policy, which is already geared towards macroeconomic and microeconomic reforms to restore stability and promote more solid, stable economic growth. The problem for the president, Mauricio Macri, and his ruling centre-right Cambiemos coalition, is that the Fund has a very poor reputation in Argentina, reflecting its role before and after the country's deep economic crisis of 2001-02. Argentina's return to the Fund will, therefore, weigh on the government's approval ratings, and will embolden the opposition, with less than 18 months to go until the presidential election.
The government will be hoping to get its policy agenda back on track in time for the presidential election, when Mr Macri will seek a second term. However, the opposition will be smelling blood and will increasingly obstruct policy. Cambiemos lacks a congressional majority, meaning that the administration has to negotiate legislative support on an ad hoc basis with various factions of the Partido Justicialista (PJ, the Peronist party). The PJ, which dominated politics for decades before Mr Macri's election victory in 2015, is struggling to regroup from that defeat and is beset by internal divisions. The party is currently split between a left-wing, populist faction and a centrist faction that, as yet, has no single, clear leader. The PJ's divisions have until now worked in the government's favour, allowing the government to pursue its legislative agenda with the support of moderate Peronists. Moreover, until now Mr Macri has remained relatively popular, with voters giving him the benefit of the doubt on the need for economic adjustment. But patience is wearing thin.
In this environment, the opposition will begin manoeuvring for position ahead of the presidential election, and the government will struggle to push its agenda through. In the aftermath of its strong performance in the October 2017 mid-terms, the government moved quickly to pass reforms to the tax system, pensions and competition policy (and in May managed to pass capital market reforms). But in coming months, major reforms will be on hold, and opposition challenges to policy initiatives that are presented will increase. All this means that much-needed reforms to increase the flexibility of labour markets, improve the effective-ness of the judiciary, and enhance investor confidence in institutions and contract rights will be on the back burner. On our current assumption that Mr Macri wins a second term in 2019, we expect that improvements in these areas will start to yield results more clearly late on in our five-year forecast period.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
The next presidential election is due in October 2019. Notwithstanding the president's current difficulties, we currently continue to assume that Mr Macri will win a second four-year term, based on our assumption of a recovery in GDP and a substantial reduction of inflation by then. There are large, and growing, risks to this forecast. Reflecting the difficulties faced by minority governments in Argentina, no non-Peronist government has won a second consecutive term since the end of the military dictatorship in the 1980s. The emergence of a strong challenger from the Peronist party is therefore likely (although it is as yet unclear who this will be), and the election will be closely fought.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
We expect relations with key international partners to remain strong under the Macri administration. The country took over the rotating presidency of the G20 in December 2017, and is pursuing an agenda centred on the future of jobs, infrastructure and food security; although limited progress on this agenda is likely in a difficult international environment, Argentina's holding of the G20 presidency is another important milestone in the government's efforts to restore Argentina's international image. The government is keen to seek trade deals under the auspices of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union). The problem for Argentina and its Mercosur partners is that, just as the grouping has started to reverse its own protectionist tendencies, anti-globalisation sentiment has grown in the OECD. However, Mr Macri is continuing to seek support for an EU-Mercosur trade deal from his counterparts in Europe, and negotiations are continuing, although they are slow moving. In the meantime, Mercosur members including Argentina have pushed for free-trade negotiations elsewhere, including with Canada and China, and for closer relations with the Pacific Alliance free-trade area.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Currency depreciation pressure amid an emerging-market sell-off has intro-duced substantial political uncertainty, but major changes to economic policymaking are not envisaged under the terms of the three-year, US$50bn IMF stand-by arrangement (SBA), other than a more rapid tightening of fiscal policy. The govern-ment has made progress since it came to office at the end of 2015 and began grappling with the task of restoring macroeconomic stability while improving conditions for business. But macroeconomic adjustment is clearly incomplete: inflation came in at 26.3% in May, amid continued utilities tariff rises (intended to reduce the fiscal burden of subsidies), and the fiscal deficit remains substantial, at 6% of GDP in 2017.
Still-high inflation has contributed to currency overvaluation, which has in turn produced a large and growing current-account deficit. These imbalances have contributed to the sharp peso adjustment of the past two months, and to the government's decision to seek an IMF lending deal to restore market confidence. The US$50bn SBA was approved on June 20th and an initial disbursement of US$15bn was made available immediately for deficit financing and to help to restore reserves coverage ratios. The government may treat the deal as precautionary going forward, and future drawdowns will depend on market access. The deal includes targets for a tightening of fiscal policy to produce a primary fiscal balance by 2020 (in order to contain growth in the public debt/GDP ratio and reduce inflationary deficit financing), and provisions for central-bank target independence to be enshrined in law, to help to tackle the inflation problem (the root of Argentina's external competitiveness problem, which is in turn driving devaluation pressures).
We expect that programme targets will be met, and will gradually reduce inflation and engender macro-economic stability over time. This will have positive implications for the external sector and growth. The biggest risks to this outlook are political, and reflect the possibility that voter (as well as business) confidence in the Macri admin-istration and the economic outlook feeds into further market volatility and economic activity. This would not only complicate the adjustment process, but also threaten our assumption that Mr Macri will secure a second term in power, raising questions as to the future direction of economic policy under a new government.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
In its first two years of office the government pursued gradual fiscal tightening (so as not to thwart economic growth), but, in the face of market pressure, it has now accelerated the pace of adjustment under the auspices of the Fund deal. The fiscal targets set out in the deal were broadly in line with our expectations and allow for a relatively gradual adjustment, partly reflecting provisions that allow for increased social safety net expenditure. For 2018 the primary fiscal deficit target is 2.7% of GDP, for 2019 it is 1.3% of GDP, and for 2020 the government is targeting primary fiscal balance. Bearing in mind that the government beat its fiscal target in the first five months of 2018 by a substantial margin, the 2018 target should not be difficult to meet, although it will require cuts to planned capital spending, which will have a knock-on impact on economic growth. Apart from capital spending, expenditure restraint will come via a phasing out of costly energy subsidies and the recent approval of a social security reform that will produce substantial savings (0.4% of GDP per year from 2018). The biggest risks to meeting the fiscal target centre on the government's ability to maintain public-sector wage restraint amid above-target inflation and strong public-sector union power, as well as below-target revenue, reflecting a sharp deceleration of economic activity this year.
The government is-for now at least-facing a problem with liquidity rather than solvency. We assume that despite this liquidity problem, deficit financing will not prove problematic, owing to the IMF deal, and assuming that market access improves from 2019 as currency pressure subsides. Argentina's recent upgrade from "frontier" to "emerging" market status in the MSCI index (MSCI is an index provider whose classifications are widely used by global investors), will also help in the medium term, by allowing for increased capital inflows from institutional investors. All that said, the public debt/GDP ratio is likely to continue to rise in 2018 to just over 60% of GDP, before stabilising in the remainder of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The Banco Central de la República Argentina (BCRA, the central bank) has tight-ened monetary policy sharply to help to stem currency pressures, and will unwind its rate rises only very slowly. Over little more than a week at the start of May the bank raised the policy rate by 1,275 basis points, to 40%. Further currency depreciation is possible in the short term, and further rate rises remain a risk (although for now we expect rates to stay on hold). Recent sharp policy tightening and a rebuilding of reserves following the disbursement of the first tranche of IMF funds should restore some calm, allowing the central bank to begin to unwind its dramatic rate rise over the next few months. This process will be complicated, however, by weak confidence in the nascent inflation-targeting regime, which means that inflation expectations are not well anchored and pass-through from currency depreciation into consumer prices is relatively high. Persistently weak confidence in the inflation target led in June to the departure of the central bank president, Federico Sturzenegger, in an effort to restore credibility in policymaking. His replacement, the former finance minister, Luis Caputo, is well known and well regarded, but, more than staffing changes, real progress on disinflation will be required to restore confidence in monetary policymaking.
The BCRA has been clear in its view that current price pressures are temporary, and we share this view. But in the meantime, the latest steep peso slide will feed through to a spike in prices in May-July. We do still expect monthly inflation to start to ease towards 1% on a con-sistent basis late in 2018, once the effects of currency depreciation and tariff adjustment start to fade. This should allow for gradual monetary easing beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing for an extended period thereafter, providing for moderately positive real interest rates in the medium term.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Reflecting data for April showing the substantial impact of a severe drought on economic activity we have made a further downward revision to our growth forecast for 2018, from 1.6% to 0.8%. This forecast represents a dramatic change from the start of the year, when market expectations were for growth of over 3%, and demonstrates that Argentina's economic output is not yet sufficiently diversified to withstand the impact of drought on the important agricultural sector (agriculture accounts for a fairly hefty 11% of GDP, and agro-industry is also important to the economy). On top of drought, output is likely to be effected at mid-year by tighter macroeconomic policy and the jolt to confidence following the currency turmoil and IMF bail-out. Our forecasts currently assume that activity will follow the pattern of previous severe droughts and will begin to recover in the third quarter. Reflecting this positive carryover effect, and assuming a return to normal harvest levels next year, (as well as a restoration of confidence as disinflation begins), we now expect GDP growth to reach 3% in 2019. For both 2018 and 2019 there is an unusually high degree of uncertainty attached to our forecasts. There is, on the one hand, a not insubstantial risk that policy tightening on top of drought tips Argentina into full-blown recession. But, on the other hand, activity could rebound more quickly than we currently have pencilled into our forecasts if real currency adjustment prompts a more rapid than expected impetus to export manufacturing activity.
For now our forecasts for the second part of the forecast period (2020-22) are unchanged, although the risks to these forecasts have risen substantially. Under our benign baseline forecast, we expect growth to fluctuate around 3% in 2020-22, dipping below 3% in 2020 amid a projected cyclical downturn in the US, before accelerating back above 3% in 2021-22. This projected acceleration in 2021-22 rests on the assumption that that implementation of recently passed and ongoing structural reforms will gradually boost economic activity. There is increasing downside risk to this assumption, in the form of a weakening of consumer and business confidence, and the potential for a much more tense presidential election period in 2019.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
The reduction of inflation will continue to be complicated in the short term by gradual increases in utilities tariffs as these are brought closer in line with market prices. On top of this, rapid recent peso depreciation, in a context of unanchored inflation expectations, will produce substantial pass-through effects, keeping inflation high in the very short term. However, assuming that macroeconomic policy remains tight under the auspices of the IMF deal, domestic demand remains subdued relative to the boom years of 2004-11, and domestic supply strengthens on the back of an improved regulatory environment for agricultural and other producers, we continue to expect gradual disinflation in the medium term. It will take quite some time, however, for inflation to fall to single-digit levels. According to our baseline forecast, this will happen towards the end of 2020.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
The peso has been badly hit in the past three months as investors that had previously given the administration the benefit of the doubt over its ability to reverse macroeconomic imbalances zeroed in on the country's large fiscal and current-account deficits. The latter reflects clear overvaluation of the peso, a problem that worsened last year as huge inflows of portfolio capital produced real currency appreciation. As a result, at end-2017 the real effective exchange rate was 14% stronger than the average of the previous 20 years. Recent currency adjustment will go some way to reversing this trend, assuming that disinflation occurs as expected from late 2018. In the short term, we believe that co-ordinated efforts by the government and the central bank to regain the confidence of investors will be successful in preventing further uncontrolled devaluation of the peso in coming weeks. However, we expect the peso to continue to depreciate in both nominal and real terms, to address the problem of currency overvaluation. Under our baseline forecast, the currency will depreciate to Ps28.96:US$1 at end-2018 and Ps38.52:US$1 at end-2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
More front-loaded currency weakening than previously projected will provide some boost to external competitiveness, but even so, in 2018 the current-account deficit will remain large, with the boost to net exports of goods and services becoming more evident from 2019. Even in 2022 we expect the current-account deficit to remain substantial (although more manageable), at 2.8% of GDP. After a period of huge inflows of portfolio capital in 2016-17, access to finance will be trickier and more costly in 2018-19; meanwhile, inflows of foreign direct investment will average an unspectacular 2.1% of GDP in 2018-22. This introduces risks to our assumption that import cover will continue to improve gradually over the medium term, although inflows of IMF credit will be supportive of reserves.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The government-comprising Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza, the party of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras) and the small, right-wing Independent Greeks (AE)-has a two-seat majority in the 300-seat parliament. The government is vulnerable to further defections and there is a significant risk of an early election (the next election is due by September 2019). The centre-right New Democracy (ND) would probably win the most seats and form a coalition government.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Greece to remain subject to strict policy conditionality over the medium term and until Greece's debt to its international creditors is substantially reduced. Protests over labour market reforms, pension cuts, privatisation, and tax and social security increases are likely to continue as the government strives to meet the ambitious annual primary surplus budget target of 3.5% of GDP until 2022, as agreed with Greece's euro zone creditors.
Greece will face its biggest macroeconomic challenge after it exits the bail-out programme. How the economy performs during the transition will determine whether Greece will remain in the euro zone. We assess the risk of it leaving the euro zone by 2022 at more than 50%, given the difficulties that the country will face in attaining rapid growth while meeting large primary surplus targets and restoring competitiveness without a currency devaluation. We expect that public debt will still equal about 170% of GDP in 2022.
Greece does not face any short-term financing difficulties as it will have sufficient funds to cover its debt repayments for almost two years after it exits the bail-out programme in August 2018. However, the challenges posed by the very high public debt burden and a poor growth outlook mean that Grexit will remain a significant risk over the medium and long term.
We forecast that annual average inflation will edge down from 1.1% in 2017 to 0.7% in 2018, before accelerating to an annual average of 1.5% in 2019-22, reflecting higher oil prices and a pick-up in domestic demand. These trends will result in widening, but still moderate, current-account deficits in 2018-22.

Greece's score recovers modestly in our 2018-22 forecast period, from a low base. The main areas of improvement are expected in the macroeconomic environment and efforts to improve policy towards foreign investment, private enterprise and competition, and the labour market.
Country forecast overview: Greece's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: The country's privatisation agency, under new management, gains momentum. Deals start to make progress.
2020-22: Efforts to valorise public property through concession management and long-leasehold development agreements.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: The Investment Incentives Law of 2016 offers more tax relief and fewer subsidies, and focuses predominantly on small firms. Plans to cut down on bureaucracy make little progress.
2020-22: "Fast-track" legislation could become more important if the economy normalises. It will cover "strategic" investments in energy, tourism, transport, communications and health.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Capital controls introduced in June 2015 are eased gradually. The risk of Greece leaving the euro area and reintroducing exchange controls and, possibly, restrictions on trade will remain high after exit from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
2020-22: There is a 60% risk of Greece leaving the euro area if growth continues to disappoint.
Taxes
2018-19: Extensive efforts to widen the tax base. Government pledges to pursue aggressive tax collection, but implementation is tough. Indirect taxes increase. Mandatory introduction of electronic point of sale terminals helps.
2020-22: Small progress in cutting corporate income tax or value-added tax (VAT). Measures to tackle tax evasion stepped up, independence of the tax authority remains in doubt.
Financing
2018-19: Liquidity tight. Uncertainty constrains lending capacity. Steps to reduce non-performing loans (NPLs) painfully slow, but foreign interest picks up. A moratorium on foreclosures is lifted for the majority of debtors.
2020-22: Lending hampered by need to make provisions for still high NPL portfolios. Greece's main banks sell more of their overseas subsidiaries. Some form of normalcy in sight towards the end of the forecast period (2018-22).
The labour market
2018-19: Labour market reforms now mostly passed, but implementation is problematic. Unemployment remains high.
2020-22: EU-funded job-creation schemes, particularly for youth, raise employment, but create few productive jobs.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Energy infrastructure comes to the fore as Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) nears completion. Privatisations pick up pace.
2020-22: Despite technical assistance from the EU, problems with absorption persist.
Technological readiness
2018-19: Greece rolls out high-speed internet, at a slow pace. The private sector adopts electronic payments by law.
2020-22: Significant financial and technical assistance from the EU, but Greece remains a laggard.

a Actual.
Background: After 400 years of Ottoman rule, Greece emerged as a sovereign state in 1830. A devastating civil war followed the retreat of German occupying forces in 1944. A military junta ruled the country from 1967 to 1974, but since then a democracy has been in place. In 1981 Greece joined the European Economic Community, now the EU. It became a member of the economic and monetary union (EMU) in 2001, but its public finances became unsustainable, resulting in a sovereign debt crisis in 2009-10. Greece's public debt has put its continued membership of EMU in question.
Political structure: Greece is a parliamentary republic, with deputies elected for four-year terms. The prime minister and the government hold executive powers. The president is elected by the 300-member parliament for a five-year term. The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. Since the 2010 crisis the traditional party system has broken down. Voters have blamed the parties that ruled Greece after the return of democracy in the mid-1970s-New Democracy (ND) and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok)-for causing the crisis, which led to the imposition of painful austerity by the country's external creditors. The result has been political fragmentation and the rise of populist parties such as the left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), which came to power in 2015, and far-right parties such as the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (XA).
Policy issues: The ND-Pasok government of 2012-14, like its two predecessors, imposed draconian austerity packages. It also enacted fiscal and some structural economic reforms to meet the conditions of two EU-IMF bail-out packages totalling EUR240bn. Implementation proved difficult and ultimately brought down the government. After a seven-month confrontation with Greece's creditors, the Syriza-led government negotiated a new three-year European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme. In 2012 public debt held by the private sector was restructured. The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any further debt write-down. After Greece exits the programme when it expires in August 2018, the country will be subject to much closer scrutiny by its creditors than other EU member states have been after they exited their programmes.
Taxation: The tax rate on corporate profits is 29% and on distributed dividends is 10%. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45% for income of more than EUR40,000. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at rates of 24%, 13% and 6%.
Foreign trade: In 2017 goods exports (fob) were worth EUR27.9bn (US$33.5bn) and imports (fob) amounted to EUR46.3bn. The current account registered a deficit of EUR1.4bn, equivalent to 0.8% of GDP.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
The coalition government-comprising Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza, the party of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras) and the small, right-wing nationalist Independent Greeks (AE)-has survived since September 2015, despite having only a slim majority in the 300-seat parliament. Following the defection of two members of the AE, in protest at the agreement on the 27-year Macedonia name dispute, the government's majority has been reduced to two seats. Mr Tsipras will aim to see through his parliamentary term, but the government will be vulnerable to further defections ahead of the next parliamentary election (due by September 2019). The name issue in particular has the potential to destabilise the government.
In August 2015 the government tied its acceptance of bail-out reforms under a three-year (2015-18) programme through the European Stability Mechanism (ESM, an inter-governmental assistance fund for countries in the euro zone), the country's third since 2010, to obtain debt relief from its official creditors. Almost three years later, the government is on the verge of exiting the programme, but it has lost much popular support along the way. Mr Tsipras is hoping to revive his party's political fortunes once Greece exits the programme, having secured further debt relief, and will be hoping that economic growth gains momentum over the coming year.
Tensions within the government coalition will persist on a range of issues, including the "enhanced surveillance" to which Greece will be subject once it exits the bail-out programme; continued implementation of austerity measures; and the Macedonia name issue. The AE has said that it will oppose the agreement when it is brought before parliament and the senior ruling party may struggle to obtain the required majority.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
The Syriza leadership is hoping to take credit for a clean exit from the bail-out programme to boost support for the government. However, the party trails in the polls behind the centre-right New Democracy (ND), led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, and the gap has been above 10 percentage points for some time. It is possible that this will narrow during the next election campaign, as Mr Tsipras is a formidable campaigner and there is little popular enthusiasm for Mr Mitsotakis or his party. However, given widespread popular disaffection with the government, the election is ND's to lose. If, as The Economist Intelligence Unit expects, ND wins the largest share of the vote at the next election, the party would benefit from the 50-seat bonus rule for the winning party. But it would probably have to secure the support of one or more other parties to muster a parliamentary majority.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
On June 12th Mr Tsipras and Zoran Zaev, the prime minister of Macedonia (the official name of which is the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM; the country's constitutional name is the Republic of Macedonia), announced their agreement to change the latter's constitutional name to Severna Makedonija (North Macedonia). The two leaders attended a ceremony on June 17th at the Prespes lake district in northern Greece, at which their respective foreign ministers, Nikos Kotzias and Nikola Dimitrov, signed an agreement to change the country's name. The breakthrough is only the first step towards a resolution of the name dispute, and-given significant public opposition in both countries-the agreement may ultimately fail to come into effect. The agreement will be put to a referendum in Macedonia and must be approved by both countries' parliaments before it can come into force.
Tensions between Greece and Turkey have risen recently. The risk of military confrontation is high, particularly in the Aegean Sea, but we think that both sides will seek to avoid clashes. Points of contention-such as historical territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea, the Greek courts' rejection of Turkey's extradition request for Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece on the night of the failed coup in Turkey in July 2016, and the arrest in March 2018 by Turkish police of two Greek soldiers on patrol in the border area of Evros for alleged espionage-continue to fuel distrust.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
On August 20th Greece will emerge from an eight-year period (2010-18) during which it has received a total of EUR274bn ($US323bn) in official financial support from European creditors and the IMF (EUR32.1bn from the latter) and has been subject to three economic adjustment programmes. Repaying its outstanding public debt, which was EUR344bn (or about 180% of GDP) at the end of the first quarter of 2018, means that future Greek governments will be subject to huge policy constraints. Fiscal austerity and policy conditionality will remain the order of the day for the next five years and beyond.
At the June 21st meeting of the Eurogroup, Greece's official creditors agreed to close the final review of the third bail-out programme. This paves the way for a disbursement of EUR15bn. Of this, EUR3.3bn will be used to pay down the more expensive IMF debt, and the balance will constitute a buffer for Greece to use while it builds up market access. The total buffer, estimated at EUR24.1bn, should be sufficient to cover almost two years of the country's financing needs. This is more onerous than a precautionary credit line would have been, as Greece will be accruing interest on money it does not currently need. However, intense political pressure not to invite further policy conditionality resulted in the government opting for the more expensive option.
The Eurogroup meeting agreed to further debt relief for Greece, which was granted a ten-year grace period and a ten-year maturity extension on EUR96bn of its loans (provided by the European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF). It will also get a reduction in the interest rates (for loans of EUR130.9bn) and a return of profits from the securities market programme (SMP) and the Agreement on Net Financial Assets (ANFA) from official sector holders of Greek debt, estimated at around EUR5bn.
Greece, in return, has agreed to long-term fiscal prudence. The country must achieve annual primary budget surpluses of 3.5% of GDP in our 2018-22 forecast period and of 2.2% of GDP thereafter, until 2060. Greece will also be subject to an "enhanced surveillance" regime, which is a more exacting system of post-programme monitoring than those applied to other former bail-out countries. The debt-relief measures will be subject to quarterly reviews of the state of the economy and of the government's adherence to the agreed prudence. Furthermore, these reviews will be published, so Greece's market access would be adversely affected if it were to transgress.
After a three-year absence, Greece has returned to the financial markets three times since July 2017. However, after August it will do so without the backstop of an official credit line. Global financial volatility temporarily delayed the issuance of a seven-year bond in February, highlighting the kind of difficulties that Greece could face in future.
The country will have sufficient funds to meet its financing needs over the short term, through to early 2020. However, over the medium and long term, the political and, arguably, the economic price of meeting high annual primary surplus targets may become unbearable. Over the past two years Greece has exceeded its annual primary surplus targets, but this has been at the expense of economic growth, which has been disappointing, given the low base. Meeting such targets will remain a constraint on growth, alongside other negative factors, such as poor demographics and a rather weak business environment. Grexit is not a short-term risk, but, given that Greece is highly unlikely to improve competitiveness inside the euro zone or grow its way out of its huge debt burden, it will pose a significant risk over the medium and long term.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Greece recorded a small surplus of 0.6% of GDP (ESA 2010 methodology) in 2016 and a primary surplus (budget balance minus interest payments) of 3.7% of GDP, outperforming its budget targets under the third economic adjustment programme. In 2017 the budget surplus increased to 0.8% of GDP and the budget primary surplus exceeded the target of 1.75% of GDP, coming in at 4% of GDP. We expect a broadly balanced budget in 2018, with only a minimal deficit, but we do not expect Greece to meet its annual primary surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP this year (or in the next four years). We forecast that the deficit will widen gradually from 2019 onwards, reflecting constraints on revenue collection, a relaxation of spending restraint and moderate economic growth.
The restructuring of government debt to the private sector cut the debt/GDP ratio to 159.4% at end-2012, from 171.9% in 2011. However, large primary budget surpluses in 2016-17 were not sufficient to arrest the growth of gross consolidated government debt, which rose to EUR317.4bn, or 179.1% of GDP, in 2017. Government debt is now almost entirely owed to official creditors. We expect that, without a debt write-down and assuming moderate nominal GDP growth rates over the medium term, the public debt/GDP ratio will remain about 171% in 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The European Central Bank (ECB) is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a quantitative easing (QE) programme that ran at EUR60bn per month until the end of 2017, and is running at EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018. However, the ECB's view of the outlook improved markedly during 2017 and, although economic activity in the euro zone softened in early 2018, a more upbeat tone has emerged. We expect an end to monthly asset purchases under the QE programme at the end of 2018. Rising commodity prices and evidence of building domestic price pressure in some parts of the euro zone should mean that sufficient inflationary pressures will begin to emerge on the policy horizon in 2019-20. In response, we expect the ECB to take steps towards normalising its policy stance, with an increase of 25 basis points in the main refinancing rate, to 0.25% in early 2020, followed by five more rises that will lift the rate to 1.5% by end-2022. An increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019, easing the pressure on banks' lending margins and supporting profitability.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Compared with 2007 levels, real GDP has shrunk by more than a quarter, government consumption by almost 25%, household consumption by one-fifth and gross fixed investment by almost two-thirds. The recovery, under way since the beginning of 2017, is fragile and vulnerable to domestic and external developments, as demonstrated by the marked slowdown in activity in quarterly terms in the second half of 2017. We forecast that real GDP growth will pick up from 1.3% in 2017 to an average of 1.9% per year in 2018-22. The risks to our forecast are balanced. Upside risks include another strong tourism season. Downside risks include the frailty of the banking sector and political instability.
According to preliminary data released by the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT, the national statistics office), seasonally and calendar day-adjusted real GDP expanded by 0.8% quarter on quarter and by 2.3% year on year in January-March. We forecast growth of 1.8% in 2018, but still expect a combination of more and higher taxes, higher social security payments, debt repayments and spending cuts to put pressure on household disposable income. We expect a modest acceleration in household spending in 2018-22, but this will be from a low base and will be constrained by primary surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP per year, still high unemployment and insipid lending growth.
A welcome development in 2017 was a sharp acceleration in fixed investment growth, albeit from a low base, and we expect growth momentum to continue in 2018 and beyond. We expect fixed invest-ment growth to average 5% per year in 2018-22. However, underinvestment during the crisis and the depletion of Greece's capital stock, as well as uncertainty about Greece's euro zone membership, are likely to restrict growth potential in the medium term.
Greece's external trade will be constrained by its relatively uncompetitive goods exports. Over the medium term we expect tourism to support services export growth, contributing to annual average growth of exports of goods and services of 5.3% in 2018-22. An escalation of trade tensions between the US and the EU is the main risk to external trade growth in the short term.
Greece will face its biggest macroeconomic challenge after it exits the bail-out programme. How the economy performs over the next five years and beyond will determine whether the country will remain in the euro zone. We assess the risk of Greece leaving the euro area by 2022 as above 50%, given the difficulties that the country will face in attaining rapid growth while meeting large primary surplus targets, and in restoring competitiveness without a currency devaluation. Grexit would lead to a sovereign default and a severe recession in the first few years, but the economy would then grow rapidly, assuming a responsible fiscal policy guided by the need to achieve a primary surplus. Growth rates under this scenario would be faster than those in our medium-term forecast. We have not incorporated Grexit into our forecast numbers.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
After stagnating in 2016, Greece's seasonally adjusted EU harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) rose by 1.1% year on year in 2017, driven by rising global energy prices, particularly in the fourth quarter. The HICP rose by 0.8% year on year in May, up from 0.5% in the previous month, marking the fastest rate of growth since December 2017. Economic growth is picking up, but major slack remains in the labour market, and domestic demand is subdued. Despite rising global commodity prices and tourism, we expect annual inflation to edge down this year, to an average of 0.7%. We forecast a pick-up to inflation of 1.5% per year on average in 2019-22 as the pace of growth quickens.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
In 2017 the euro rallied as the region's economic recovery strengthened and expectations of QE tapering increased. The exchange rate peaked at almost US$1.25:EUR1 in February 2018, but weakened to US$1.17:EUR1 by late May in response to the formation of a populist, Eurosceptic government in Italy. The value of the euro could yet come under further pressure from political risk in Italy and monetary tightening in the US. Nevertheless, we expect a stabilisation on average, at US$1.21:EUR1 in 2018-21, as the euro is supported by a recovery in the region and receives structural support from a large current-account surplus, and the business cycle downturn in the US will weigh on the value of the dollar in 2020. Thereafter we expect the euro to appreciate to US$1.24:EUR1 on average in 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
There has been a marked reduction in Greece's current-account deficit since the start of the crisis, mainly reflecting the compression of imports as a result of contracting domestic demand, but also improved competitiveness in the tourism sector. The current-account deficit narrowed to 0.8% of GDP in 2017, from 1.1% of GDP in 2016, according to data published by the Bank of Greece (the central bank). We estimate widening deficits in 2018-22 as import prices continue to rise and import volumes gradually pick up in line with higher domestic demand, but the deficits will be smaller than the average annual deficit of 7.2% of GDP since Greece joined the euro zone in 2001.

Background: The political geography of Europe has been defined by two world wars and the legacy of the cold war, during which Europe was divided into two blocs. The ending of Soviet control over central and eastern Europe from 1989, followed by the collapse in 1991 of the Soviet Union, provided an opportunity to expand the EU eastwards. Ten new member states (eight from the former communist bloc) were admitted to the EU in 2004, followed by a further two in 2007, and Croatia in 2013. In June 2016 the UK electorate voted in a referendum to withdraw from the EU. The economic transition of the Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) has proceeded more smoothly than that of other east European countries. The effects of war in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and a slower pace of reform have shaped developments in south-east Europe.
Political structure: All 28 EU member states are parliamentary democracies, although in some of the newer, former communist members in particular the substance of democracy-including a political culture based on trust and healthy levels of political participation-is often absent. The communist period lasted much longer in the former Soviet Union, and political developments in most parts of that region have been characterised by a drift towards authoritarianism.
Policy issues: Many aspects of domestic policy for EU member states-in particular those relating to the single market-are decided collectively at the EU level. Nineteen EU member states share the euro as their currency. These countries are subject to a single monetary policy administered by the European Central Bank. They are supposed to comply with common fiscal rules, although these have often been ignored. During the euro zone debt crisis several member states (Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain) ceded varying degrees of policy control to the EU and the IMF in exchange for receiving financial support. Although the euro zone crisis has passed its peak, normalisation remains a long way off. The Economist Intelligence Unit continues to attach a 60% probability to Greece leaving the euro zone during its medium-term forecast period (2018-22). Outside the EU, the speed and extent of reform and institutional change vary widely. Countries with proximity to Western markets and with stable political outlooks have proceeded faster and more successfully with economic stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation. Institutional problems, such as weakness in the rule of law and widespread corruption, plague much of non-EU Europe.
Taxation: Individual tax regimes operate in all countries. All EU member states must operate a system of value-added tax (VAT), with a minimum of 15% as the standard rate.
Foreign trade: If intra-EU trade is included, the EU accounts for about half of all global trade. About 60% of trade conducted by EU member states is intra-regional.

Summary
Political stability
Popular disaffection with mainstream parties will persist during the forecast period. Anti-establishment parties formed a government in Italy in May, setting Italy on course for a clash with the EU over immigration and budgets, two issues that are becoming the focus for wider conflicts in the bloc.
Six months after the German election, a government was formed in March. A coalition crisis that broke out in June over migration policy reinforces the Economist Intelligence Unit's view that political instability will increase in coming years.
In the UK, Brexit outcomes are finely balanced between two scenarios: staying in a customs union and being closely aligned to single-market rules; and a snap election that would probably install a pro-Brexit government that takes a tougher line. The risk of a no-deal Brexit would be greater in the second scenario.
Russia will continue to pursue a muscular foreign policy. We expect EU sanctions on Russia to be maintained and for relations to remain difficult.
Economic policy
We do not expect the EU to undertake the ambitious reforms advocated by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, which will meet resistance from member states wary of an increase in risk-sharing.
Tensions arising from negotiations over the EU's seven-year budget framework for 2021-27 will intensify. We do not expect agreement on the budget framework until after European Parliament elections in May 2019.
We expect the European Central Bank to begin normalising monetary policy in 2019, with an increase in the deposit rate, and a rise in the main refinancing rate in early 2020.
Economic growth
We forecast average real GDP growth in the EU28 of 1.9% in 2018-22, following estimated growth of 2.5% in 2017.
We expect a real GDP growth slowdown in the UK in 2018-19, to 1.5% per year, owing to Brexit uncertainty. Growth will pick up in 2019-22.
The EU has responded with retaliatory tariffs to the imposition by the US of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Germany will aim to avoid an escalation that leads to the US imposing tariffs on European automotive exports.
Business environment rankings
The business environment has improved in most European countries as the post-crisis economic recovery has gathered pace. However, fragilities remain.

Political outlook: Political stability
The UK's vote in June 2016 to leave the EU represents a serious challenge to the future cohesion of the bloc. Despite the professed unity of the other 27 member states, the departure of one of the EU's biggest members will continue to reverberate after the UK leaves in March 2019. For example, its departure will leave a big hole in the EU budget, which will be difficult to overcome without generating antagonism within the bloc.
Brexit is by no means the only challenge. The EU's problems have been compounded by a broader populist insurgency against the political mainstream, which brought to power an anti-establishment government in Italy on June 1st. Across the continent, populist parties and politicians are putting pressure on the mainstream political parties to address their concerns, especially on the subject of migration and integration policies.
Immigration is becoming an increasing focus of conflict in the EU
Italy's new government has already clashed with the EU over immigration, a long-festering issue that is fast becoming the focus for wider conflicts in the bloc. In June, Italy and Malta both refused to accept ships full of migrants rescued en route to Europe, with the new Italian government insisting that other EU countries shoulder more of the burden of immigration from Africa. Also in June, a conflict erupted in the coalition government in Germany when the Christian Social Union (CSU) demanded a change in Germany's policy towards migrants arriving at the border.
In addition, the issue of refugee relocation is a focal point for tensions between the EU and a core of central European countries. In September 2015 the European Council established a temporary scheme to relocate across the EU some of the Syrian refugees who had arrived in Italy and Greece, with the aim of sharing the burden of accommodating them. This was particularly controversial in central and eastern Europe, where governments characterised it as an attempt by western Europe to export the consequences of misguided foreign policies, and claimed that it raised the prospect of terrorist attacks as a result of Islamist infiltration. Public opposition to the scheme has been substantial across the region. The EU is also in conflict with Hungary and Poland over rule-of-law issues.
The Catalonia crisis, which escalated in October 2017 after pro-independence citizens voting in an illegal referendum on the region's independence from the rest of Spain encountered state violence, poses another threat to the cohesion of the EU. The change of government in Spain in June may lead to an easing of tensions between the central state in Madrid and the pro-independence bloc in Catalonia, but the Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect an early resolution of the conflict.
Meanwhile, relations with Russia are strained. This is the result of many issues, including the expansion of NATO into eastern Europe; Western intervention in Kosovo in 1999; the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia; the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea and conflict in eastern Ukraine; Russia's intervention in Syria; alleged attempts by Russia to interfere in political processes in the West; and the nerve-agent attack on a former Russian intelligence officer on British soil in March 2018. The EU has responded by imposing sanctions against Russia and expelling Russian diplomats.
There is no room for complacency, as underlying problems remain unresolved
The lesson of the past decade, since the global economic and financial crash of 2008, is that politicians have underestimated the economic and political challenges. Threats to the future of the EU, including the sovereign debt crisis, the migration crisis and the populist insurgency, have not been resolved. The existential threat to the euro has certainly lessened since the height of the sovereign debt crisis in 2010-13, when the danger of one of the peripheral economies being forced out of the euro zone, through a loss of investor confidence and a spike in bond yields, weighed heavily on sentiment and investment. The commitment of the European Central Bank (ECB) to the euro has largely neutralised speculative pressure in the bond markets, but the single currency is still vulnerable. Popular disaffection with the political order in Europe remains substantial. This is likely to fuel support for anti-establishment parties and bring about destabilising political realignments in the coming years.
The management of Europe's crises has been complicated by the weakened position of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, following her party's poor performance in the September 2017 federal elections and the onset of an embryonic coalition crisis in June 2018. France's president, Emmanuel Macron, has sought to re-energise the Franco-German partnership; last year he laid out sweeping plans for EU and euro zone reform. Many of Mr Macron's ideas are not new-some of them already enjoy widespread support in the EU-but the energy with which he is championing his vision for Europe contrasts sharply with Ms Merkel's more managerial and reactive European leadership style.
A decision on reform proposals will be made at the EU summit on June 28th-29th. In mid-June Germany and France presented a shared set of proposals. This included a commitment to a small euro zone budget, which had previously seemed a political non-starter in Germany. However, this will run up against objections from other, smaller member states, which will hold on to their traditional red lines. Nevertheless, the strength of the Franco-German axis, with support from a number of southern member states, is likely to be sufficient to lead to a relatively ambitious set of reforms, which will nevertheless take several years to fully implement.
Migration is likely to be the headline-grabbing issue at the summit. A domestic political crisis has forced Ms Merkel to seek out a deal to cut migration with European partners. Despite a broadly-shared wish to cut the number of arrivals by increasing border security and striking deals with northern African countries to limit departures, disagreements remain on how to handle the issue of the redistribution of asylum-seekers across the bloc. The political pressure to move on this issue, including from the new populist Italian government, leads us to expect that a number of new measures will be announced, including plans to strengthen the EU's border control agency, Frontex.
Budget negotiations will test EU cohesion
Tensions arising from negotiations over the EU's next seven-year budget framework for 2021-27 will also play into the debate on EU reform. The European Commission has proposed that all member states increase their financial contribution to meet the shortfall in the budget created by the withdrawal of the UK, the fourth-largest contributor. Germany and eight central and east European countries are willing to pay more into the budget, whereas others (including Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark) would prefer to reduce the budget after Brexit. Agreement on the budget framework is unlikely until the second half of 2019, after the European Parliament elections in May 2019. We expect the Commission to secure larger budget contributions from all EU member states, but achieving this is likely to involve a reallocation (or "modernisation") of funds, which is likely to include shifting funds from the eastern member states to the crisis-hit southern members. This will also reflect a shift in the balance of power within the EU after Brexit, as the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark will have lost the UK as an ally.
Coalition dispute points to difficulties ahead for Germany
It took almost six months to form a government following the September 2017 general election. The government is another grand coalition of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) with the CSU (its Bavarian sister party) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD). The election dealt a blow to the two leading parties, which recorded their worst results since the 1950s (32.9% and 20.5% respectively), and also brought the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) into the Bundestag (the lower house of parliament).
The AfD performed better than expected, polling 12.6% nationally, and did especially well in the former east Germany, where the party became the second-largest political force. Exit polls indicated that the issue of migration and refugees was the main reason for voting for the AfD, with many voters signalling that this was a protest vote.
Pressure from the AfD has recently led to ructions in the CDU-CSU alliance. The CSU is under pressure from the AfD ahead of the Bavarian state election in October, and Horst Seehofer, the interior minister and leader of the CSU, has tried to outflank the insurgent party on the immigration issue. His demand for Germany to turn back at the border migrants who had previously registered in other EU countries has led to a mini-crisis in the government. Ms Merkel argued that this would lead to a domino effect of border closures, as Austria would close its border with Italy if Germany sent migrants back to Austria, and that it was in any case a decision for her, not Mr Seehofer. The dispute was temporarily paused when Ms Merkel promised to work towards a European solution on the migration issue. The CSU will decide on July 1st whether the agreement reached at the EU summit is good enough to curb migration into Germany. Should the party deem it inadequate and insist on border checks, the coalition could fall apart. We expect Ms Merkel to come home with sufficient concessions for Mr Seehofer to save face and for the coalition to remain intact.
The next few years are likely to be a testing time for Germany, with the rise of the AfD putting pressure on the conservative CSU and causing difficulties for the CDU/CSU coalition. The SPD will also struggle to revive its fortunes as the centre of political gravity shifts to the right. Tensions will persist between the CDU and the CSU, and the question of Ms Merkel's successor and the future direction of the CDU will continue to hang over the Christian Democratic bloc. Meanwhile, the AfD will do its best to test the government.
An unstable political settlement in Spain
Spain has also been a source of recent political volatility. On June 1st Mariano Rajoy, the former leader of the conservative People's Party, became the country's first prime minister to be forced out of office through a censure measure. The motion was tabled by Pedro Sánchez, the leader of the centre-left Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), following a series of damning verdicts in the so-called Gürtel corruption trial, which implicated a number of former PP officials and policymakers and resulted in a fine for the party.
Mr Sánchez now leads a very weak minority government, which controls just 84 of 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies, the dominant lower chamber of parliament. To unseat Mr Rajoy and become prime minister, the PSOE leader assembled an unlikely ad hoc majority in Congress, including the populist Podemos, the PSOE's rival on the political left, and a number of smaller, regional nationalist parties, including the two main Catalan pro-independence formations. Mr Sánchez has stated that he intends to see out the current parliamentary term, which ends in mid-2020, but there is a high risk of policy paralysis, which could potentially lead him to call an election sooner.
The PSOE government's legislative remit will be tightly constrained. Mr Sánchez will seek to overcome this through powers of decree, but has pledged to maintain the PP's fiscal plans for 2018, after which the 2018 budget could be rolled over to 2019 and possibly even to 2020. The prime minister has also admitted that the PSOE will be able to make only superficial changes to the PP's landmark 2012 labour reform, which he had previously pledged to scrap.
With few other firm policy promises, the core of Mr Sánchez's mandate will be to open a more productive dialogue with the pro-independence government in Catalonia. His political strategy appears to centre on projecting an image of leadership, both at national and EU level. He has appointed a highly qualified cabinet, composed mainly of women, and will seek to build the PSOE's credibility ahead of the next election.
Few policy changes after the re-election of Mr Putin
On March 18th Vladimir Putin was re-elected to a fourth term as president, securing a record 76.7% of the vote on a turnout of 67%. Mr Putin's re-election was widely expected, given his approval ratings of around 80%, and in the absence of credible opposition candidates. Although the election itself was a non-event, it ushers in a period of political uncertainty as various factions of the elite jockey to secure their position in the post-Putin political order-assuming that Mr Putin stands down at the end of his term in 2024. In Mr Putin's fourth term, we expect a greater focus on domestic policy, in an effort to arrest falling living standards and bolster growth following the 2015-16 recession. However, even modest liberalising reforms are unlikely and we expect the state to retain its dominant role in the economy. In the foreign policy arena, we believe that Russia will continue to pursue a muscular policy, with the aim of asserting its status as a major player on the global stage. The country's international influence will be strengthened by the conclusion of international business deals in strategic sectors such as oil, nuclear-power plants and military equipment.
Conventional politics upended across the continent
Recent elections across Europe have followed the Italian and German pattern, with voters increasingly favouring alternative or populist parties over their mainstream counterparts. The result has been greater political fragmentation, protracted negotiations to form governments and the emergence of unusual government coalitions. Elections held in the Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Iceland and the Czech Republic in 2017 illustrated the trend towards increased political fragmentation, as well as a more complicated policymaking outlook.
Spain faces a constitutional crisis over the Catalan question
Another impetus towards the breakdown of post-war political arrangements and fragmentation comes from regional movements demanding greater autonomy or independence in countries such as Belgium, Italy, Scotland, Spain and elsewhere, including in eastern Europe. Spain has been plunged into political crisis by an illegal referendum and subsequent unilateral declaration of independence in Catalonia. The central government responded by using Article 155 of the constitution to dismiss the Catalan government and assume control of the region in late October 2017, and called new regional elections.
In the regional election in Catalonia in December 2017, pro-independence parties won a parliamentary majority, with less than 50% of the popular vote. The liberal, pro-unity Ciudadanos (Citizens) topped the poll with 25.4% of the vote. The election confirms the polarisation of views on independence. It produced little numerical change in the balance of power between the electoral blocs of pro-independence and pro-unity parties, despite a turnout above 80%, which the unionists hoped would deliver them victory.
The separatist parties-the Catalan Republican Left (ERC), the centre-right Junts per Catalunya (JuntsxCat; Together for Catalonia) and the anti-capitalist Popular Unity Candidates (CUP)-won a combined 47.5% of the vote and 70 seats in the 135-seat parliament, compared with 47.7% and 72 seats in 2015. The three pro-unity parties-Ciudadanos, the Socialists' Party of Catalonia (PSC) and the conservative People's Party (PP)-won a combined 43.5% and 57 seats, up from 39.2% and 52 in 2015. The non-aligned Catalunya en Comú (the Comuns, associated with Podemos-We Can) polled 7.5% and won eight seats.
Ciudadanos is the largest party, with 37 deputies and 25.4% of the vote. Its strong performance came mainly at the expense of the PP, whose support slumped from 8.5% to 4.2%. Ciudadanos will be unable to form a government, but its success in Catalonia is a warning to the PSOE and the PP, the two main national parties.. The regional election result was in line with our forecast and was a major blow for Mr Rajoy.
With a number of prominent pro-independence politicians in custody and facing serious charges, ranging from rebellion and sedition to misappropriation of funds, and the former regional president and several other ministers claiming to lead a government in exile in Belgium, the pro-independence movement faces serious challenges in agreeing on the political direction for Catalan separatism. This could take the form of a renewed push for independence or, more probably, pressure for a legal referendum, as well as protests over what the pro-independence movement regards as the unjust treatment of its leaders at the hands of the Spanish state. The election of Mr Sanchez as prime minister raises the chances of a reduction in tensions between the national and the regional government. However, we expect the Catalonia conflict to drag on.
The Brexit negotiations will test EU cohesion
The Brexit negotiations began in June 2017, after the UK government invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on March 29th of that year, beginning the formal two-year process of the country's withdrawal from the bloc. In the Article 50 letter, Theresa May, the prime minister, confirmed that the UK would not seek membership of the EU's single market. This is in line with the government's intention to honour the Brexit vote by taking control of laws, borders and budget. The UK will also leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
The UK would like tariff-free access to EU markets, but customs union membership would mean a common external tariff and would prevent it from negotiating trade deals with other countries. The UK will thus try to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the EU and has proposed alternatives to customs union membership, including a "highly streamlined" arrangement and a new "customs partnership" that reduce non-tariff barriers to trade such as technical regulations, compliance requirements and rules-of-origin documentation. We expect the new relationship to be phased in gradually, to minimise disruption. This may mean continued adherence to EU rules for a period after withdrawal.
A deal would be mutually beneficial, but the risk of no deal is high
The UK will formally leave the single market at the end of the Article 50 process in March 2019. UK and EU negotiators have reached agreement on large parts of the draft withdrawal agreement that they intend to finalise by October 2018, such as citizens' rights, the financial settlement, Euratom and on most areas relating to separation provisions. There is also full agreement on the terms of the transition period, which will last for 21 months after the UK's formal withdrawal. During this period, the UK will maintain access to the single market, but will be bound by the obligations of membership. The UK made several concessions that are unpalatable to Brexiteers: EU law will still be applicable; EU budget contributions will continue; the UK will have no say over fishing quotas; and there will be reciprocal free movement and subsequent entitlement to settled status until the end of the transition period. A win for the UK is that it will not be bound by the EU's trade policy, enabling it to negotiate and agree (but not implement) new trade deals during the transition.
There is an increasing risk that the EU and the UK will fail to reach agreement on the Irish border issue, and that this will scupper the withdrawal agreement. The proposals for a customs partnership and the highly streamlined customs arrangement have so far been met with scepticism and it is looking increasingly likely that the government will implement some form of its "backstop" proposal to effectively keep the UK in a customs union with the EU beyond the end of the transition period in 2021. Under this scenario, the UK would remain subject to single-market rules in many areas and the scope of a future trade agreement with the EU would therefore be limited.
However, this would be in breach of Mrs May's "red lines" and could trigger a revolt by Brexiteers, leading to the prime minister's removal, a snap election and the return of a committed pro-Brexit government. We would expect a pro-Brexit government to pursue a tougher line in the negotiations and aim for a comprehensive free-trade agreement outside the single market and customs union. Trade flows with the EU should be facilitated by the close nature of the future trading relationship, which should involve some degree of regulatory alignment. However, a viable alternative solution to the EU customs union would still need to be found, and a hardline stance on both sides would increase the risk of a breakdown in the negotiations.
Realistically, only the framework of a trade deal will be agreed by the time the UK withdraws in 2019, as completing the withdrawal agreement will take priority in 2018. However, transition arrangements will allow negotiations to continue, and we expect a deal to be in place by 2021.
Political outlook: Election watch
We expect political risk to remain high in Europe throughout the forecast period. In the euro zone, in particular, the negative political fallout from the financial crisis, coming on top of the long-term erosion of the post-war political party system, is proving to be electorally disruptive. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that fragmentation and difficulties forming a government occur even in countries that are registering solid rates of growth, such as Ireland, and in traditionally politically stable countries, such as the UK.
The new Italian government is likely to be unstable and short-lived
The general election in Italy on March 4th 2018 yielded an acutely fragmented parliament. It also produced a resounding victory for the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S), which won about 32% of the vote, and the Eurosceptic anti-immigrant Lega, which won about 17%.
Amid heightened market volatility, and following a prolonged period of post-election negotiations-including a stand-off with the president, Sergio Mattarella over the proposed appointment of Paolo Savona, a strongly Eurosceptic economist, to the post of minister of economy and finance-M5S and Lega reached a last-minute deal to form a government on May 29th. The administration is led by Giuseppe Conte, an independent law professor close to M5S. The leaders of M5S and the Lega, Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini, will serve, respectively, as deputy prime minister, and as labour and economic development minister and interior minister. Giovanni Tria, a more moderate economist, has been appointed to the economy and finance ministry, while Mr Savona will be minister of EU affairs.
We expect the Conte government to be short-lived and to send mixed signals to the EU institutions and other member states. In addition to seeking looser fiscal policy constraints, the administration will press the EU hard on its immigration and migration policies, demanding greater support for Italy coping with vessels arriving across the Mediterranean. It will also press for a tougher line on EU free-trade agreements, particularly the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), and may seek a loosening of sanctions on Russia over the annexation of Crimea.
The government's domestic policy priorities include a tougher stance on unauthorised migration; policies meant to reduce poverty, such as a means-tested "citizenship income" for job-seekers; a rollback of recent reforms to the public pension system and the labour market; the implementation of a two-rate "flat tax"; and the disarmament of safeguard clauses in the country's fiscal framework that would automatically raise fuel excise and value-added tax rates if alternative fiscal consolidation measures are not specified. So far, Mr Conte's government has pledged to continue reducing the public deficit, which came in at 2.3% of GDP in 2017, but it could announce a more dramatic shift in policy in the update to its medium-term fiscal framework, to be released in September, and its draft 2019 budget, due to go before parliament by October 2019.
We expect the M5S-Lega coalition to pass only some of the measures it has proposed, beginning with the less costly ones, such as tougher immigration policies, plans to dismantle the 2012 pension reform, and measures to disarm the budget safeguard clauses. Proposals for a "citizenship income" and a two-rate flat tax could be implemented in phases or postponed until sufficient resources can be found. The public deficit-which we currently forecast at 2% of GDP this year and 2.3% of GDP in 2019-is likely to widen, although the government is not expected to breach the 3% of GDP maximum mandated by fiscal compact rules.
Crossing this psychological threshold would be likely to trigger another intense bout of market turmoil as the ECB phases out its sovereign quantitative easing purchases, making it very difficult for the government to finance its costly policy plans at sustainable rates. Owing to investor concerns over the administration's intentions, Italian assets are likely to prove more volatile in the coming months. For now, we do not envisage any major changes in the country's meagre GDP growth outlook, which we forecast at 1.3% this year and 1.1% in 2019.
Turkey heading for one-man rule after June elections
Parliamentary and presidential elections were due to have been held in November 2019, but were brought forward to June 24th 2018. As we had forecast, the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, won re-election easily in the first round. This completes the transition to an executive presidency, following a constitutional referendum in April 2017. Turkey will effectively move to one-man rule by Mr Erdogan.
The transfer of executive powers to the presidency means that there will be few checks and balances on the president. No prime minister will be appointed. Mr Erdogan will draft the state budget and directly choose ministers and senior officials, as well as judges. In addition, he will have the ability to issue executive decrees on social, economic and political issues. Parliament will have only limited powers as Mr Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) holds a majority of the seats with its coalition partner, the right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP). Given his popularity, the fragmentation of the opposition and the positive coverage he gets from state media, we expect Mr Erdogan to remain in office with enhanced powers for at least one more five-year term, and quite possibly a further such term (the maximum allowed) up to 2028.
Fine Gael minority coalition government will not survive full term
The collapse of Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael-led minority coalition government in Ireland was narrowly averted in late November 2017. Our view remains that the government does not have the capacity or cohesion to address effectively the mounting economic and political challenges facing Ireland. As a result, we continue to believe that the government will not survive a full term to February 2021 and that a snap election will take place in the second half of 2018 or in early 2019. However, the landslide victory by 66.4% to 33.6% for those campaigning to liberalise Ireland's highly restrictive abortion law in the historic referendum in May was a boost for Mr Varadkar, who campaigned for a "yes" vote, and for his government. He will seek to build on the momentum of the referendum result to increase his party's support.
Given voter disillusionment with the three established parties-Fine Gael, Fianna Fail and the Labour Party-we expect the next election to be inconclusive, as in February 2016. Another such outcome would put greater pressure on Fine Gael and Fianna Fail to set aside their historical differences and form a grand coalition.
At the 2016 general election none of the established parties was willing to contemplate entering a coalition with the nationalist Sinn Fein party led by Gerry Adams, which had links to the now disbanded Irish Republican Army. We think that this is unlikely to change after the next election, but a transition is now under way in Sinn Fein. The leadership has passed to Mary Lou McDonald, one of the party's younger members, who is not associated with the conflict in Northern Ireland.

Political outlook: Intra-regional tensions
Policy-related tensions remain high within the euro zone, but the risk that they will prompt a breakdown in inter-governmental relations has fallen sharply over the past 18 months, as economic growth has picked up across the bloc. The ECB has overcome objections in a number of countries-notably in Germany-to its use of unconventional policy instruments. However, the breathing space created by the ECB's programme of sovereign quantitative easing has, up to now, not been used by political leaders to bolster the economic recovery with a strong united position on fiscal policy and structural reform.
The rise of anti-establishment political sentiment across much of the bloc has generated increased pressure for economic policymaking that is focused on national considerations rather than on the integrity of the euro zone, creating new centrifugal forces at a time when policymakers are already struggling to remedy the institutional shortcomings of the single currency. Huge political capital has been invested in keeping the euro zone together in recent years. This should ensure its survival in the short term, but the risk of a partial break-up in the medium term remains significant. Greece is unlikely to face any short-term financing problems once its exits its third bail-out programme in August 2018. However, Greece's membership of the euro zone will remain in question over the medium and long term, given its high public debt burden (almost 180% of GDP in 2017) and its poor long-term growth prospects.
Hungary and Poland will continue to clash with the EU over refugees and other issues
The nationalist, socially-conservative governments in Hungary and Poland have come into conflict with the EU over the bloc's refugees relocation policy and by creating what the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, has called an "illiberal" state. In addition to refusing to take their allocation of refugees, the Hungarian and Polish governments have curbed the independence of the judiciary, imposed government control over the public service media and clamped down on civil-society groups. The European Commission has referred several of these measures to the ECJ but it has so far struggled to find an effective response. Attempts to invoke Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, possibly resulting in the suspension of a member country's voting rights, are unlikely to succeed. They require the unanimous vote of all members, and Hungary and Poland have made clear that they would support one another in such an event.
Tension between Turkey and the EU will remain high
Despite talk of agreeing a new roadmap to ease tensions and improve co-operation in the main areas of interest such as security, trade and investment, neither Turkey nor the EU is genuinely interested in Turkish membership of the bloc anymore. However, neither has yet been willing to suspend negotiations unilaterally. If Turkey reintroduces the death penalty, as Mr Erdogan has suggested, the EU will probably seize this opportunity to suspend the accession process. This would almost certainly prompt the country to end its collaboration with the EU to stem the movement of migrants and refugees into Europe. A settlement of the de facto division of Cyprus between the Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north could help to improve Turkey's relations with the EU, but talks collapsed in July 2017. We maintain our forecast that a settlement is unlikely during the forecast period.
Tensions between Turkey and the US, the country's traditional ally, have risen since the failed coup in July 2016. The Turkish government has sharply stepped up its anti-Western rhetoric in recent months, and attributes the recent sharp depreciation of the lira to a foreign plot. In addition, the US government refuses to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a cleric whom the Turkish government believes organised the failed coup. In the coming months, the US could impose international financial sanctions against Turkish banks that facilitated transactions that did not comply with US Iran-related sanctions. Such a step would further strain the relations between the two countries.
Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved. Russia has lifted almost all sanctions and Turkey has acquired S-400 Russian air defence missiles, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly in relation to the conflict in Syria, where both are militarily involved but have so far pursued contrasting goals. We expect relations to remain largely transactional, and there is a significant risk that new tensions will emerge.
Mr Erdogan's state visit to Greece on December 7th-8th 2017-the first such visit by a Turkish president in 65 years-was a tense affair. Greater co-operation on issues such as trade and security may result, but points of contention will continue to fuel distrust. Historical territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea or more recent events, such as the Greek courts' rejection of Turkey's extradition request for Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece on the night of the failed coup in Turkey in July 2016, and the arrest and imprisonment of Greek soldiers who strayed over the Turkish border on March 1st 2018, will continue to be flashpoints. We expect relations to remain tense, with sporadic flare-ups, but we do not expect an outbreak of conflict.
Russia-West tensions are at their highest level since the cold war
East-West political tensions are at their highest since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Russia is slowly dismantling the security and arms control agreements that were put in place in at the end of the cold war. Russia's opposition to the post-cold war security architecture was evident in its decision to withdraw from the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) and its breach of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, which bans short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. Western countries have accused Russia of funding opposition parties in western Europe and employing cyber warfare against Western targets, as well as engaging in a propaganda war through media outlets that it controls in the West.
Russian-Western tensions intensified when a former Russian intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on March 4th, having been attacked with a nerve agent in the UK city of Salisbury. The UK government accused the Russian state of being behind the attack. Despite the tough talk from the UK, so far the measures taken, including the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomatic staff, have been rather modest.
Tensions with Russia are unlikely to abate
Russia has said that the EU and the US are interfering in its sphere of influence, supporting the "colour revolutions" in former Soviet space. Russia has accused NATO of going back on its post-cold war commitments by expanding relentlessly, first taking in central Europe and the Baltic republics, then Albania and Croatia in 2009 and, most recently, Montenegro in June 2017. Bosnia and Hercegovina (BiH) and Macedonia are now in the waiting room for admission. The Iraq war and colour revolutions fuelled Russian insecurity and convinced Russia that the US wanted "regime change" in the country, and possibly the break-up of the Russian Federation. In the face of such an existential threat, from the Kremlin's perspective any countermeasures are justified.
In March 2014 Russia annexed Crimea and has since been providing military support to pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. The EU imposed sanctions on Russia's energy, defence and banking sectors in July 2014 following the downing of a passenger plane over Ukrainian territory controlled by Russian-backed separatists. The sanctions are subject to regular renewal, requiring the approval of all 28 EU member states. The Minsk II ceasefire agreement, signed in February 2015, is unlikely to lead to a resolution of the conflict in Ukraine. Russia sees Ukrainian integration with the EU and NATO as a direct threat to its national interests. The current status quo, of a regularly breached ceasefire and contained levels of fighting, is likely to endure for several years. This will serve Russia's interests, as a frozen conflict will prevent closer integration with the EU.
Russia is opposed to EU and NATO integration with the countries of the former Soviet Union. Regime change in any country in Russia's immediate neighbourhood, particularly via a pro-Western popular uprising similar to the Ukrainian Maidan revolution in 2014, would trigger a crisis in relations between Russia and the West.
We do not expect political or economic upheaval in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region in 2018. The exceptions to this outlook are Uzbekistan, where the new president will continue to pursue a reformist course, and Armenia and Georgia, where street protests have led to change in governments and which will outpace most of the region in terms of economic growth. In Kazakhstan, uncertainty will increase regarding the succession of the long-time president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, and the launch of the Astana International Finance Centre will not be an investment game-changer. We believe that no significant political or economic change will take place in the other central Asian countries (the Kyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan). The vulnerability of several countries, including Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, to political and social instability will remain high.
Economic policy
Euro zone reform efforts are being stepped up
The threat of a euro zone break-up has receded in recent years as the region's economic recovery has strengthened and broadened, and as its institutional underpinnings have become more resilient. The commitment in July 2012 by the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, to "do whatever it takes" to preserve the euro represented a turning point for the bloc, the resilience of which to shocks has also been bolstered by the establishment of an EU banking union and a permanent rescue fund. EU leaders are currently making a renewed push for further integration of the economic and monetary union. Proposals put forward by the European Commission in December 2017 included turning the European Stability Mechanism-the euro zone's bail-out fund-into a European Monetary Fund (EMF) that would provide a backstop for the banking union; a stabilisation function for the euro area, which would deal with asymmetric shocks by providing resources to support investment at the national level; and a euro zone economy and finance minister who would oversee the EMF and serve as vice-president of the European Commission.
Some aspects of these plans will meet internal resistance and will struggle to get off the ground. The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that, although strengthening the existing structures would be helpful, such proposals are not essential for the continuation of the region's economic recovery. EU leaders will present reform proposals at a summit in late June 2018.
The UK's departure from the EU will encourage policymakers to address some of the structural deficiencies that have held back the economy in recent years, including lacklustre productivity growth, insufficient innovation and poor infrastructure. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced a National Productivity Investment Fund to boost the UK's digital infrastructure and spending on research and development over the next five years. Proposals to reform the UK's housing market have focused on introducing greater speed and flexibility into the planning process. There will also be a new effort to improve vocational skills. We expect these measures to support the recovery in productivity, but they are still too modest in size and scope to close the UK's productivity gap with its G7 peers.
The Queen's Speech in June 2017 set out the government's legislative agenda, which was dominated by Brexit. Eight of the 27 bills relate to the transfer of EU law into British law, a UK customs regime, independent trade policy, controls on immigration, fisheries policy, agricultural policy, nuclear safeguards and the UK's ability to impose international sanctions. In a further sign that Brexit is the government's priority, the parliamentary session will last for two years rather than one, ending two months after the UK's withdrawal at end-March 2019.

Data based on national definitions.
A conservative fiscal bias has prevailed across most of the region since the global crisis in 2008-09, leaving policymakers to rely heavily on low interest rates and unconventional monetary policy tools as the main levers with which to manage their economies. This created a significant degree of exposure to the impact of the monetary policy cycle in the US, where we expect further tightening in 2018-19. Although we continue to expect monetary policy to remain accommodative in most countries, we now expect fiscal policies to be slightly more supportive during our five-year forecast period (2018-22).
We expect fiscal consolidation to exert a much less powerful drag on growth in 2018-22 compared with the preceding five years. Almost all European countries improved their fiscal positions in 2009-17. Although we expect fiscal policies to be slightly more supportive of economic growth, significant fiscal loosening remains off the agenda for most countries, especially for those with high public debt loads, owing to the rigidity of the rules agreed by EU members at the height of the euro zone crisis. The average euro zone government debt/GDP ratio was 86.7% at end-2017, but Belgium, Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Portugal had debt ratios in excess of 100%, and those for France and Spain were only slightly below 100%. Hefty debt loads will remain a challenge for much of the euro zone for many years. Although the cost of debt servicing has fallen dramatically in recent years owing to the exceptionally low interest rates that currently prevail across the bloc, borrowing costs are set to rise gradually as monetary policy is normalised.
The UK government is targeting steady deficit reduction
The UK's fiscal position improved in 2016-17, and we expect this improvement to be maintained in 2018-22, despite a fiscal loosening in the November 2017 autumn budget. We forecast that the deficit will stabilise at about 1.8% of GDP in 2018, after coming in at 1.9% of GDP in 2017. We expect the deficit to narrow to 1.6% of GDP by 2020 and 1% of GDP by 2022. We forecast that public debt will decline from 88% of GDP in 2018 to 81% of GDP by 2022.
Within the EU, over the past two years a number of national governments have shown signs of pushing back against centralised fiscal constraints, which are significantly more rigorous as a result of changes introduced in response to the crisis. In 2016 tensions between several member states and the European Commission, which enforces the EU's budgetary rules, came to a head. In early July 2016 the Commission proposed that Spain and Portugal should be fined for their failure to meet deficit targets in 2015, but the Commission ultimately stepped back from this position. The episode highlighted the growing tension between the strict fiscal rules agreed at the height of the crisis and the mounting political and economic arguments within member states for a greater degree of fiscal flexibility.
The tight budget constraints facing the Russian government are abating, owing to higher oil prices. We expect oil prices to average more than US$73/barrel in 2018-22-an improved but still challenging outlook, compared with an average price of about US$50/b in 2015-17. The Ministry of Finance will continue to pursue a conservative fiscal policy in 2018-22, but the adjustment to expenditure is likely to be less radical than planned, particularly in the short term, given Mr Putin's recent social spending promises; rising global oil prices; plans to reduce defence spending in favour of other areas; and the government's conservative oil price forecasts, which almost guarantee that revenue will outperform expectations. We expect the budget to return to a small surplus in 2018, of 0.3% of GDP. The budget surplus will increase but remain below 1% of GDP throughout our forecast period.
Economic policy: Monetary policy and exchange rates
Interest rates (av; %) 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022
Euribor -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0.4 0.9 1.4
US$ 3-month commercial paper rate 1.1 2.0 2.7 2.6 1.7 2.0
US 10-year government bond yield 2.3 3.1 3.5 2.7 2.3 2.8
10-year German government bond yield 0.4 0.6 0.9 1.2 1.5 1.8
Despite the healthy economic outlook across the region, an absence of corresponding inflationary pressure means that the ECB will keep monetary policy accommodative in 2018-19. Policy interest rates will remain below zero and an asset purchase programme will run at EUR30bn (US$37bn) per month until September and at EUR15bn per month in October-December, before coming to an end.
The ECB and regional central banks are moving towards policy normalisation
Economic growth and tightening labour markets should mean that sufficient inflation will begin to emerge in 2019-20. In response, we expect the ECB to take the first step towards normalising its main refinancing rate in 2020, before embarking on a gradual tightening cycle that would bring the interest rate to 1.5% by end-2022. The next increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019, easing the pressure on banks' lending margins and supporting profitability. The stock of assets held by the ECB will rise to about EUR2.6trn (US$3.2trn) by the end of 2018, and be maintained at this level throughout the forecast period.
When setting interest rates, other central banks will have to weigh up the net effect of a moderating euro zone economy and greater protectionism elsewhere with their desire to normalise monetary policy. Caution is likely to win out: we expect the Bank of England (the UK central bank) to delay its next increase in interest rates to August, and rate rises in late 2018 are now more uncertain in the Czech Republic and Sweden. It is still likely that Norges Bank (Norway's central bank) will tighten policy in September and that the Swiss National Bank (SNB) will lift its policy interest rate by a small amount in 2019, although we now expect the SNB to reduce its foreign-exchange interventions in 2019, rather than in late 2018.
The BoE is keen to normalise monetary policy
The UK economy has been sufficiently resilient in the aftermath of the Brexit vote for its central bank to increase the main policy interest rate from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017, the first rate rise in a decade. The monetary policy committee (MPC) of the Bank of England kept policy unchanged in June 2018. The chief economist, Andy Haldane, voted to increase interest rates by 25 basis points to 0.75%, increasing the number of MPC members in favour of tighter policy to three, from two previously. The committee's hawks are still outnumbered by six other members who preferred to keep the policy rate at 0.5% in June. However Mr Haldane's vote makes it more likely that the balance of opinions on the MPC will shift in favour of higher interest rates in the months ahead. We maintain our forecast for a rate rise at the policy meeting on August 2nd.
Turkey's economy has shown resilience during previous bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing largely to the country's solid public finances, its well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector and its dynamic, diversified private business sector. However, the risk of an intensification of political instability and fluctuations in global liquidity could disrupt foreign capital inflows during the forecast period. These inflows are needed to meet the country's large external financing requirements, but tend to be short term and highly volatile. Shifts in capital flows triggered by expectations of tighter US monetary policy, domestic political uncertainty and geopolitical tensions in the neighbouring region have already put the lira under severe pressure on several occasions since late 2016, and most lately in April-June, fuelling an acceleration in inflation. Under political pressure not to raise rates significantly, the Central Bank of Turkey is constrained in its ability to tighten monetary policy. In the event of another severe weakening of the lira after the elections, it could abruptly tighten monetary policy and reimpose capital controls. However, this is not our baseline scenario.
In Russia, the fall in oil prices, which led to a significant contraction in real GDP and household consumption in 2015-16, has underlined the imperative for reforms to encourage investment and diversification away from commodity exports. However, we do not expect significant reforms to be undertaken during Mr Putin's fourth term, and the Russian president will continue to prioritise social and political stability. We expect state involvement in the economy to remain substantial. In his March 1st state of the nation speech, Mr Putin set out some of his socioeconomic goals for his next presidential term. His agenda appeared to include fragments of competing policy agendas proposed by Aleksei Kudrin, a former finance minister, and the Stolypin Club, an economic research group led by a business ombudsman, Boris Titov. The Kudrin camp emphasises the need to reduce the role of the state in the economy and to increase competitiveness and productivity by investing in human capital, in contrast to the Stolypin Club's call for a more statist and Keynesian policy agenda. Reform of the tax system-including an increase in the value-added tax rate-and a gradual rise in the pension age appear likely. Institutional reform to strengthen the rule of law and protection for businesses looks much more difficult to achieve.
Policy to be kept tight to support the Turkish lira and lower inflation
The Turkish lira has been highly volatile and on a generally depreciating path against all major currencies since mid-2013, when the prospect of a gradual reduction in ultra-loose global liquidity and an eventual tightening of policy took shape. After a sharp fall in the nominal value of the lira against the US dollar in 2017, we expect the pace of depreciation to slow slightly during the forecast period. There are substantial risks to this forecast, arising from uncertainty about the outlook for global financial flows as well as the impact on investor confidence of domestic political tensions and geopolitical turmoil in the region.
Inflationary pressures have continued to weaken in Russia
Russia has seen steady consumer price disinflation since late 2015, with inflation under 2.5% year on year in January-May 2018, well below the Central Bank of Russia's 4% inflation target. Disinflation has been assisted by record harvests in 2016-17, as well as the relative strength of the rouble (against the US dollar and the euro). The weakening of the rouble in April could boost imported inflationary pressures, and we expect inflation to pick up modestly in the second half of the year, almost reaching the 4% target near the end of 2018, as the rouble depreciates against the US dollar compared with 2017 and consumer demand increases. In 2019-22 we expect inflation to remain close to-but slightly above-the 4% target (very low levels by historical standards).
Higher oil prices and a relatively tight monetary policy led to an average appreciation of the rouble against the US dollar in 2017 and in the first quarter of 2018. However, when the US imposed new sanctions on Russia on April 6th, the rouble lost about 12% of its value against the dollar, reaching Rb64.8:US$1 on April 11th. Taking into account the tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve (the Fed, the US central bank) and the uncertainty surrounding possible new US sanctions, we forecast a modest depreciation of the rouble against the dollar, to an average of Rb60.2:US$1 in 2018.
We forecast an overall slight nominal appreciation in 2019-22, owing to increasing oil prices, although a downturn in the US business cycle will lower oil prices slightly and weaken the rouble in 2020. The rouble is correlated with oil prices, so any rapid fall in oil prices could lead to renewed volatility.
For central and east European countries with currencies pegged to or managed against the euro (mostly in the western Balkans), risks of volatility have moved in line with expectations of tightening by the Fed. However, we do not see significant risks to the currency boards in Bosnia and Hercegovina (BiH) or Bulgaria, or to the peg in Macedonia. Croatia had been more of a concern, in the light of the 2015 legislation to force banks to convert Swiss franc-denominated loans into euro. However, the country's improved external and fiscal positions, and increased demand for the kuna as a result of a strong tourism performance, have driven appreciation, which we forecast will continue in 2018.
Currencies across the former Soviet Union depreciated sharply in 2015 as a result of the weakening of the rouble and lower oil prices, which hit commodity exporters. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan both officially abandoned their US dollar pegs in 2015. In practice, only Kazakhstan has allowed its currency to float. Given Kazakhstan's trade ties to the Russian economy, it would lose competiveness if the tenge appreciated significantly against the rouble. Azerbaijan appears to have returned to a US dollar peg since April 2017.

The UK economy has been resilient in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Average annual real GDP growth was firm in 2016 and 2017, at 1.9% and 1.8% respectively. However, the annual pace of growth slowed throughout 2017. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects real GDP growth to average 1.4% in 2018 and to remain broadly stable in 2019, at 1.5%.
We expect the modest slowdown in 2018-19 to be led by a deceleration in domestic demand. Consumer spending will weaken in response to the continued squeeze on real household incomes from high inflation. Consumer spending was fairly resilient to this pressure in 2017, reflecting employment gains, high levels of household borrowing and a decline in the savings ratio. In 2018 we expect employment growth to slow and greater uncertainty about the economic outlook to push up precautionary savings. Consumer spending will recover in 2019-22 as inflation eases, uncertainty recedes and unemployment edges lower. However, increased borrowing costs arising from tighter monetary policy will hold back the pace of the recovery in these years. We forecast that investment spending will decelerate in 2018-19 as a result of heightened un-certainty during difficult Brexit trade negotiations and higher cost pressures as a result of sterling's depreciation, before recovering in 2020-22 as these effects fade.
Mitigating the extent of the domestically driven slowdown in 2018 will be a positive contribution to GDP growth from the external balance as export volumes benefit from a competitiveness boost as a result of sterling's depreciation, while the weaker domestic demand environment reduces import growth. From 2019 we expect the trade balance to exert a drag on GDP growth owing to our forecast for a recovery in domestic demand, which will push up import growth again. Our expectation of a business cycle downturn in the US in 2020 and a deal on the UK's new trading relationship with the EU, which should take effect in 2021 and result in looser trade ties than before, will also constrain exports in 2020-22. We expect real GDP growth to pick up to 1.7% on average in those years.
The economic impact of the UK's vote to leave the EU on the wider regional economy could be substantial. In addition to the direct effect via trade and investment channels, over time the referendum result is also likely to compound centrifugal political and institutional dynamics in the EU and the euro zone. However, the short-term economic fallout from Brexit will be modest for Europe as a whole.

The euro zone recovery has gathered pace
The outlook for the European economy is brighter than it was two years ago, but growth is now decelerating. Real GDP growth gained momentum in 2017 as the recovery that had been building since 2013 became broad based. We expect EU28 growth to slow this year, from 2.5% in 2017 to 2.2%, before slowing to an annual average of 1.8% in 2019-22. Virtually all member states have registered firmer rates of expansion, and although country-level disparities persist, the region's recovery is looking healthier. In our view the economic recovery has further to run, partly because it is rooted in factors that will underpin sustainable demand, such as rising employment and household deleveraging. Furthermore, there remains significant slack in the euro zone economy that has yet to be absorbed.
Nevertheless, first-quarter GDP data and survey-based indicators show a natural moderation in activity from above-average growth rates in 2017. Our forecast, therefore, is that growth will slow in the euro area in 2018, to 2.1%, and then more clearly, to an annual average of 1.7% in 2019-22.
Additional risks to the region's economic prospects stem from external factors, notably monetary policy tightening in the US and protectionist sentiment washing through the global economy. The US let the EU's exemption from steel and aluminium tariffs expire in June, and the EU retaliated with its own measures on June 22nd. In turn, the US administration may decide to impose higher tariffs on EU automotive imports. This will be economically painful for both sides. We expect disagreements on trade to linger, but not to escalate to the point of an outright trade war. Nevertheless, the EU's trade surplus with the US-worth US$115bn in 2017-is unlikely to decline much in the coming years, meaning that trade will remain a politically sensitive topic that is likely to come back on to the agenda at any time.
The longer-term outlook for the euro zone also looks challenging. Demographic factors will begin to exert a more powerful drag on an increasing number of countries. We do not expect policymakers to find solutions to some of the euro zone's institutional shortcomings. In particular, they are unlikely to reform the fiscal policy framework. This means that tensions will increase between member states over targets for budget deficits.
In Germany the domestic demand-driven pick-up in real GDP growth accelerated in 2017, bringing headline growth to 2.5%. We forecast 2.1% growth in 2018, with the rate of economic expansion easing gradually thereafter, to 1.7% on average in 2019-22. Growth will be slower in France (owing to structural rigidities in the tax system and the labour market) and Italy (reflecting a weak demographic profile, political instability and a slow pace of reform).
In southern Europe the economic recovery on the Iberian peninsula may have peaked in 2017. After real GDP growth of 3% in Spain in 2017, we forecast average growth of 2.2% in 2018-22. Portugal recorded real GDP growth of 2.7% in 2017, and we forecast an expansion of 2.3% this year and 1.6% on average in 2019-22. Meanwhile, Greece will exit its third bail-out programme this year, but we are sceptical that the country will experience rapid growth. The Greek economy returned to growth in 2017 and should experience a modest rebound in 2018-22. The UK economy has been resilient in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, but is losing momentum and will slow in 2018-19 as economic uncertainty weighs on spending and investment, before recovering gradually.
The Visegrad countries can look forward to above-average growth rates
Much of central and eastern Europe faces a challenging environment in the longer term. However, countries that benefit from EU funding in particular will see real GDP growth well above the EU average in 2018-22. A deadline at the end of 2015 for fund drawdowns from the EU's 2007-13 fiscal period brought an end to a surge in investment spending. Funding inflows for projects under the 2014-20 funding period were slow to begin in 2016, holding back activity last year, but funds began to flow again in 2017 and projects are under way that will lift economic growth rates during the forecast period (2018-22). We expect that growth in Germany-a major market for these countries-will remain solid. The German economy's changing structure, with investment and private consumption rising, will provide a boost to central and east European countries with strong trade links to their larger neighbour.
Economic activity is picking up in south-east Europe
In south-east Europe the situation is generally improving after a protracted and difficult post-crisis recovery. We expect continued strong real GDP growth in the region's biggest economy, Romania (which grew by 7% in 2017), of 5% in 2018 and 3.4% per year in 2019-22. However, rapid wage growth is driving a consumer boom that is sucking in imports and inflating the current-account deficit, and tax cuts have widened the fiscal deficit. Bulgaria will also maintain the momentum established in 2015-17. In 2018-22 we expect real GDP growth to average 2.9%. This sustained pick-up is driven by improved performance in the euro zone, robust export performance and increased expenditure on infrastru-cture projects, which received a boost from a surge in the inflow of EU funds.
Growth in the western Balkans to accelerate; Baltics and Visegrad to slow
Economic activity in the western Balkans has picked up in the past three years, reflecting a combination of favourable base effects and externally driven cyclical factors such as low oil prices. In 2015-16 private investment and exports were the main drivers of growth in Albania, Montenegro and Serbia, with private consumption remaining weak, pointing to a more balanced growth trajectory. The region has undergone a significant economic adjustment in the years since the global economic crisis in 2007-09, largely correcting fiscal and current-account imbalances (with some notable exceptions, such as Montenegro). Inflation has fallen to historical lows for the region, allowing a more accommodative monetary policy that has supported growth. The revival of investment is set to continue, and over the medium and long term the western Balkans should benefit from the structural reforms that are now under way in most countries. On the downside, high public and/or private debt loads, and (in some cases) continued large fiscal deficits remain impediments to faster growth. We do not think that the fallout from the Brexit vote will be unduly negative for the Balkans, whose slow progress towards EU membership is set to continue.
We forecast average real GDP growth in the western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Hercegovina-BiH-Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia) of about 3.2% in 2018-22. We forecast that growth in the three Baltic states will decelerate from an average of 4.6% in 2017 to 3.4% per year in 2018-19.
Greece's economy has been in almost permanent recession since 2008. Compared with 2007 levels, real GDP has shrunk by more than a quarter during this period, government consumption also by nearly a quarter, house-hold consumption by a fifth and gross fixed investment by almost two-thirds. The recovery that got under way in 2017 is fragile and vulnerable to domestic and external developments. We forecast that real GDP will expand by 1.9% per year on average in 2018-22, following growth of 1.3% in 2017.
In Turkey domestic political instability, the perceived risk of terrorist attacks and uncertainty about the global economic outlook weighed on the economy in 2015-16, but relative stability following the April 2017 presidential reform referendum and fiscal stimulus measures have supported a rebound to growth of 7.3% in 2017. We expect growth to slow to an annual average of about 4.2% in 2018-22, reflecting the impact of tax increases, higher interest rates and a gradual tightening of global liquidity. The main downside risk is that further political instability stemming from the transition to a presidential system of government could deter foreign capital inflows. Upside risk stems from government plans to extend stimulus measures, but this could also result in a larger than expected fiscal deficit.
Russia's economy has moved into a recovery phase
Real GDP in Russia grew by 1.5% in 2017, up from a contraction of 0.1% in 2016. The return to growth was mainly driven by private consumption and, to a lesser extent, fixed investment. In 2018 we expect a similar growth picture, with private consumption assuming even more of the burden for driving growth as one-off government infrastructure projects are completed. As indicated in the March state of the nation address given by Vladimir Putin, the president, government spending on wages and pensions should pick up this year. Economic stabilisation and a higher average oil price are supportive of a rise in gross fixed capital formation, but international sanctions, the lack of a "culture of failure", and broader political and business uncertainty will remain significant constraints. We expect import growth to slow, lessening the negative contribution from the external balance. Overall, this points to a slight increase in real GDP growth in 2018, to 1.7%. In the medium term outdated capital stock, a declining workforce, dependence on natural-resource sectors, institutional weaknesses, subdued investment levels, a weak financial sector, international sanctions, low productivity growth, a difficult business environment and statist policies will limit real GDP growth. We forecast that growth will average 1.7% per year in 2018-22, mainly driven by private consumption and, to a lesser extent, fixed investment, as in 2017.
The possible end of Russian gas transit in 2019 represents a big risk
Real GDP fell by a cumulative 16.4% in Ukraine in 2014-15 amid conflict and a chaotic political situation. The disruption of these years accentuated a structural change in the Ukrainian economy away from heavy industry and towards agriculture. The economy recovered in 2016, driven by vigorous growth in private invest-ment, alongside a recovery in private consumption. Real GDP grew by 2.5% in 2017, fuelled by private consumption and gross fixed capital formation. Better external conditions, increased social spending (boosting consumption) and a solid recovery in investment (domestically funded) supported growth. In 2018 we expect real GDP growth to rebound, to 3%, and in 2019-22 we expect growth to average 2.6%, led by household consumption. The probable end of Russian gas transit in 2019-when the current transit contract expires and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline connecting Russia to the EU through the Baltic Sea is supposed to begin operations-represents a risk.
Growth and exchange-rate movements in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region are highly correlated to movements in global oil prices, especially in large oil exporters such as Russia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. Owing to important trade links and high levels of remittance flows, the performance of the Russian economy has a direct impact on that of smaller CIS countries in Central Asia (the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan) and the South Caucasus (Armenia and Georgia, not CIS members). We forecast growth of 1.7% in Russia, 1.6% in Azerbaijan, 3.6% in Kazakhstan and 3% in Ukraine in 2018. Given our forecast for a broadly stable oil price of around US$73.4/barrel in 2018-22, barring other major developments the growth outlook for most countries is unlikely to change significantly from this year's final outturn.

The slump in global oil prices in late 2014 exacerbated a marked disinflationary trend in Europe, but helped to boost the region's real economy in 2015, and to a limited extent in 2016, as households benefited from higher real earnings and businesses from lower input costs. Since late 2016 inflation has picked up, with base effects-notably those related to energy prices-providing much of the initial impetus in early 2017. Despite the healthy economic outlook, inflation pressures in the euro zone remain modest. In May 2018 euro zone inflation accelerated to 1.9%, from 1.2% in April, but this increase was mostly due to higher energy prices. Nonetheless, we have revised our euro zone inflation forecast for 2018 to 1.6%, from 1.4% previously. We expect inflation to average 1.7% in the EU28 in 2018 and 1.9% per year in 2019-22.
In a number of specific instances across the region, different inflationary patterns will be recorded-Turkey, for example, will struggle throughout the forecast period to bring its inflation rate down to its 5% official target. Consumer price inflation has remained stubbornly high, as a weaker lira has, for the most part, offset the disinflationary effects of plunging global oil prices since mid-2014. Assuming that the Central Bank of Turkey keeps monetary policy tight and does not loosen it again too soon, we see inflation gradually easing, achieving the 5% target by end-2022.

The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings model seeks to measure the attractiveness of a country's business environment and its major components. The model's assessment of the business environment-based on the opportunities for and hindrances to the conduct of business-enables us to rank each of the 82 countries covered on its overall position and in each of ten categories on a global and a regional basis. The model uses quantitative data and expert assessments to measure the attractiveness of countries' business environments. The framework has been designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies in formulating their global business strategies and investment location decisions. The overall scores (on a 1-10 scale) and rankings are based on scores for 91 indicators, grouped into ten categories.
There is a moderate improvement in Europe's aggregate regional scores between the historical period (2013-17) and the forecast period (2018-22), reflecting the transition from the post-crisis period to one in which recovery and repair, although patchy, have, in most countries, been under way for some time. Western Europe's score remains broadly stable, rising from 7.46 in the historical period to 7.67 in the forecast period, and eastern Europe's score moves up from 6.07 to 6.50 over the same timeframe. Across the region, the strongest ranking improvements are recorded by Denmark, Romania, Croatia and Cyprus. By contrast, Turkey drops by ten places, Switzerland by six, and Greece and Ireland by four. Western Europe is ranked second globally out of six regions, after North America (8.21), and eastern Europe is ranked fourth, after North America, western Europe, and Asia and Australasia (6.79), but performs better than Latin America (5.74), and the Middle East and Africa (5.62).
EU countries remain well represented in the top 20 of our global rankings. Two non-EU countries, Switzerland and Norway, also occupy leading positions. The large number of west European countries in the top 20 reflects the high degree of political stability in the region (a post-crisis rise in social and political tension notwithstanding), large and competitive domestic markets, and a strong degree of openness to world trade. Although we continue to highlight the risks of political fragmentation and rising anti-establishment sentiment, we do not forecast a marked anti-market backlash in policy choices.
Recent years have brought considerable improvement to the investment climate of central and eastern Europe. The early reformers among the countries of central Europe led the way in the early 1990s in adopting far-reaching stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation programmes. Reform in the Balkans has been much more uneven and subject to periodic reversals, but significant progress has been made even here. Factors such as a low-cost but well-qualified labour force, proximity to developed markets and, in some cases, ample natural-resource endowments have attracted considerable foreign direct investment to the region during the past decade. However, many east European countries still face fundamental reform challenges; meeting those challenges will test already fraying relations between governments and electorates, and heighten the risk of political instability and social unrest.
The outlook for the business environment in the countries of the former Soviet Union is mixed. In Russia the business environment has suffered as a result of Western sanctions and a rise in tariff and non-tariff barriers. There is little evidence that the government intends to undertake disruptive structural reform to improve the dynamism of the economy. Low energy prices have prompted some regional commodity exporters, notably Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, to attempt to open up and diversify their economies. Ukraine has committed itself to an ambitious reform programme; however, its economic prospects will be harmed by disruption of trade and financial ties with Russia. Throughout the region the barriers to enacting wide-ranging reform remain formidable.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 16 (infrastructure), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2013-17) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2018-22). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2013-17. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2018-22 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
The main sources used in the business rankings model include CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce; Freedom House, Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties; Heritage Foundation, Index of Economic Freedom; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; UN, Human Development Report; US Social Security Administration, Social Security Programs Throughout the World; World Bank, World Development Report; World Development Indicators; Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Report.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2013-17 ranges are then used to derive 2018-22 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2018-22, not to the likely situation in 2022 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2015 or 2020). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Abstract: In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly. [...]wastefulness at state-owned firms and massive corruption and clientelism schemes built around the delivery of subsidised goods and services would be hard to roll back without antagonising government backers, risking political instability. [...]we would expect a mixed administration to focus on macroeconomic essentials, such as the stabilisation of the currency and local prices, and tackling mismanagement of PDVSA. [...]we expect extremely limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will limit economic recovery and fuel continued unrest. Owing to the need to maintain political stability, we do not expect the closure of the various handout programmes in operation, nor the removal of utility subsidies or the reformation of inefficient state-owned firms. [...]we expect public expenditure to be hard to reduce; we expect the deficit to be substantial throughout the 2018-22 period, ending 2022 at 6.9% GDP.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Economic collapse and the erosion of the patronage scheme supporting the president, Nicolás Maduro, put the ruling regime's internal cohesion in jeopardy. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a traumatic rift that will end in regime pragmatists allowing opposition participation in a "mixed admin-istration" as a way to remain in power from 2019 onwards. There is a risk that the regime will retain cohesion and cling to power beyond 2019 if it finds financing to meet its debt obligations and boost dwindling oil production.
We estimate that inflation exceeded 2,000% at the end of 2017 and will average over 10,000% in 2018. GDP will continue to contract in 2018-20. High inflation has led to a collapse in private consumption, and difficult operating conditions have hurt investment. Following a change in policy under a new government, we expect economic growth to resume in 2021.
The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. From 2019 a new government will stabilise the economy, but the wholesale rethink of the institutional framework needed to restore investment and confidence is unlikely.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and quadruple-digit inflation will hit private consumption, and an increasingly difficult operating environment will accentuate a fall in fixed investment. The recession that began in 2014 will continue to deepen despite a partial recovery in oil prices, and the economy will not return to growth until 2021-assuming that a new government takes power and implements reforms. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
US dollar measurements of Venezuela's market size provide an overly positive picture of the economy, given the marked overvaluation of the fixed exchange rate. In reality, recession and extremely high inflation (driven by shortages of foreign exchange and basic goods) will continue to restrict purchasing power. After 2020, under a new government, we expect purchasing power and the business environment to improve.

Venezuela is in 82th position globally in The Economist Intelligence Unit business environment rankings, making it the least attractive investment location in the world. This reflects the highly heterodox macroeconomic policies of an authoritarian government, a lack of legal security and weak institutions.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government persists with bias against free markets and ad hoc recourse to heterodox measures. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and undermine free competition. Property rights remain weak.
2020-22: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Access to project financing is difficult and uncertainty over contractual rights persists.
2020-22: Efforts to attract foreign investment gather pace under a new government, although actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2018-19: Opaque currency controls add to uncertainty, severely restrict private-sector access to foreign exchange and impede trade. New government in 2019 starts removing exchange controls.
2020-22: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2018-19: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite the huge fiscal deficit. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2020-22: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2018-19: Amid severely high inflation, financing remains only available in the short term and banking sector shrinks in real terms.
2020-22: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2018-19: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. An ongoing freeze on redundancies, combined with a large informal sector and skill shortages, makes the labour market exceptionally rigid.
2020-22: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Underinvestment in the water and electricity grid ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2020-22: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued water and electricity rationing
Technological readiness
2018-19: E-government services remain almost non-existent and deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies.
2020-22: Limited regulator capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has plummeted as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices has plunged the country into a massive economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded republican institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is how to stabilise an economy mired in a years-long economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. At the same time, mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign-exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Using IMF data, The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$21.1bn in 2017 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages. We estimate the current-account surplus at 1.3% of GDP that year.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
Despite a decimated economy and spiralling hyperinflation, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) and the president, Nicolás Maduro, retain their hold on power. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects worsening economic conditions to result in a chaotic political transition, most likely ushering in a government with nominal opposition participation-a "mixed administration"-in 2019.
The opposition, of which the Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD) is the biggest grouping, remains in disarray. Apart from infighting, this reflects the PSUV's systematic campaign to disfranchise opposition parties and sideline them from state institutions. After years of ineffectual leadership, most citizens, even those opposing the PSUV, distrust opposition parties. This has left them incapable of channelling the anti-government sentiment brewing in response to the country's dire economic situation.
In this context of unrest and repression, the PSUV is increasingly dependent on the military for support. The country is run by civic-military alliance and a network of businessmen that enjoy military or political connections. The accord is sustained by opportunities for arbitrage and corruption made possible by foreign-exchange controls; subsidised imports of basic goods; and control of large and inefficient public-sector companies. Within this opaque arrangement, factions are primarily explained by personal and patronage ties, which mean that different civic-military factions coexist within the regime. The ultimate source of resources flowing through this patronage system is PDVSA, the state-owned oil company, whose exports account for the vast majority of foreign-exchange inflows.
Jeopardising the arrangement is a rapid decline in oil production due to mismanagement and underinvestment. Resultant strains have been highlighted by purges of the military, the latest coming in March. A rigged election on May 20th saw Mr Maduro re-elected, but exposed cracks in regime. Of those casting votes for Mr Maduro's re-election, the vast majority selected the PSUV proper, with a minority choosing Mr Maduro's Somos Venezuela. The PSUV proper is led by Diosdado Cabello, a long-time internal rival of Mr Maduro who has extensive military and business ties. Mr Cabello is a leading figure in the regime, but other factions within the PSUV also exist. Unless the administration turns PDVSA around (we see this as unlikely, as the government lacks the required expertise or financing), we believe that the patronage system supporting Mr Maduro will be at risk of collapse by 2019.
Internal fracture in the regime may happen earlier than 2019, as the secular trend towards lower oil output may be hastened by sanctions on oil trade by the US, PDVSA's largest cash-paying market. Following the May 20th vote, the US rolled out sanctions designed to complicate PDVSA's exports. Similarly, PDVSA's unpaid debts may lead to asset seizures that impede trade. In May ConocoPhillips, a US firm pursuing collection of an arbitration award, seized PDVSA's infrastructure in the Caribbean, disrupting exports. The parties are reportedly negotiating an agreement but if such measures become commonplace and/or reach Citgo, PDVSA's US subsidiary, exports could be disrupted indefinitely.
Regardless of the timing, what happens following the internal fracture is hard to predict. The transition is likely to be violent. The PSUV's internal stability is a concern, as the end of the current set-up is likely to unleash jostling for position between the PSUV's varied civic-military factions. If no faction secures sufficient internal consensus, a period of chaos of indeterminate duration may ensue. Alternatively, the regime may reconfigure itself, with an outright military government or PSUV civilian figureheads fronting a military-heavy administration. Such administrations would probably look to Russia and China, erstwhile backers, for aid to stabilise both the economy and PDVSA. However, we believe that the required financing-tens of billions of US dollars per year-is beyond Russia's means. China has scaled back its relations with Venezuela since 2015. Given that the regime's raison d'etre is the enrichment of its members, stabilisation of PDVSA and the economy would be likely to take priority under a new government, and we would expect regime pragmatists to seek western assistance-specifically from multilaterals and governments. As these financiers will demand democratic reforms, we believe that the most likely outcome is a "mixed administration", in which pragmatically minded military and PSUV leaders allow opposition participation as a way of gaining inter-national legitimacy. Given past behaviour, there should be no shortage of opposition figures willing to participate.
The main risk to our baseline view is that regime pragmatists will be unable to convince other regime members of the benefit of this arrangement. For example, democratic reforms that western lenders would insist on may not be acceptable to some PSUV figures. Similarly, foreign financing would underpin a macroeconomic programme that-by eliminating the economy's distortions-would close avenues for corruption and upset regime insiders. Other hurdles of uncertain size will remain. These include the judiciary, the de facto legislature that is the Constituent Assembly and violent extremist supporters of the current regime known as colectivos.
Overall, we expect a chaotic transition starting in late 2018 or early 2019. The process will be highly uncertain and may feature several false starts. We expect curtailed political stability in 2019-22.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
Mr Maduro comfortably won re-election on May 20th. However, voter turnout was exceedingly low, at 46%, denting his legitimacy and introducing questions about the regime's actual control of the population. (The PSUV's turn-out-the-vote operation uses a combination of ideological affinity and coercive tactics to corral voters.) We do not expect free and fair elections in the short term. Based on our assumption of a new government comprised of government and opposition pragmatists, an electoral timetable may be announced, as international financing will almost certainly come with demands for democratic reforms.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Most regional governments have denounced the Venezuelan government, as has the EU. The most effective sanctions have come from the US, which has instituted country-level sanctions that deny Venezuela the possibility of refinancing its debts. Sanctions banning the oil trade outright are not part of our baseline assumption, but a hawkish US foreign policy team increases the risk of this happening. A key priority for the Maduro administration will be the maintenance of good relations with Russia and China. Both have provided financing in the past, but seem unwilling to provide the several billions of dollars needed to stem the decline of oil output.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
The government remains unable and unwilling to undertake the policy changes needed to address its main challenges, namely declining oil production, hyperinflation and mounting arrears on external debt. Most sovereign and state-owned firms' bonds (including those of PDVSA) are now in arrears. The government has called for debt restructuring, but it appears impossible, owing to US financial sanctions and, more fundamentally, because the government lacks a credible economic programme. There is no sign yet of lawsuits by bondholders, who so far appear to prefer the promise of late payment to lengthy legal battles. Investors may also be waiting for news of policy changes following the May election or a change in leadership. In the meantime, both the sovereign and PDVSA are open to legal challenges in the US. Such seizures could hit exports, the regime's economic lifeline.
In the meantime, the government must grapple with a severe economic crisis. Monetisation of large public deficits and dwindling exports has led to foreign currency rationing and hyper-inflation. The government has devalued the official exchange rate, but monetary imbal-ances persist and foreign-exchange continues to be rationed. Economic policy will remain interventionist in the short term, deepening the economic crisis that drives our baseline forecast of a move towards a mixed administration.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect more orthodox economic policies to be implemented. However, the administration will face considerable internal limitations in addressing key policy challenges. For example, wastefulness at state-owned firms and massive corruption and clientelism schemes built around the delivery of subsidised goods and services would be hard to roll back without antagonising government backers, risking political instability. Thus, we would expect a mixed administration to focus on macroeconomic essentials, such as the stabilisation of the currency and local prices, and tackling mismanagement of PDVSA.
Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and multilaterals (totalling US$19bn in 2019-22) and the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. Internal cohesiveness in the mixed administration will be key, as the PSUV is ideologically opposed to such borrowing and multilateral financing is likely to come with conditions on democratic reforms. Meanwhile, PDVSA must open itself to foreign investment to secure the finance needed to bring output back on track. This will require considerable political capital, as it would imply a wholesale revision of the sector's institutional framework. Pockets of resistance are likely to exist. Internal stability within the PSUV will remain a major risk to our forecast, as the success of a mixed administration would depend on PSUV pragmatists fending off more radical party members, who would oppose accepting international assistance and reforming policy.
Outside of these areas, we do not expect much success in rolling back the PSUV's strong interventionist bend in the economy. As a result, we expect extremely limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will limit economic recovery and fuel continued unrest.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Authorities have not published data on fiscal accounts since 2011, when the non-financial public-sector (NFPS) deficit was 12% of GDP. We forecast an NFPS deficit of 15.5% of GDP in 2018, which will largely be financed by printing money. High inflation and the overvalued official exchange rate make debt/GDP ratios misleading indicators of fiscal stability. Considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) understates the true size of total public liabilities.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect a restructuring with external creditors in 2020. Owing to the need to maintain political stability, we do not expect the closure of the various handout programmes in operation, nor the removal of utility subsidies or the reformation of inefficient state-owned firms. Therefore, we expect public expenditure to be hard to reduce; we expect the deficit to be substantial throughout the 2018-22 period, ending 2022 at 6.9% GDP.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The government's financing needs will continue to force the Banco Central de Venezuela (the central bank) to print money. At the end of May M2 increased by 6,297% year on year. The government has not announced any change in policy other than planning to take three zeroes off the currency. However, the plan has been put on hold for logistical reasons. We expect a new administration to place a much greater emphasis on tackling hyperinflation, and expect a substantial monetary adjustment in the context of a macroeconomic stabilisation plan.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Amid ongoing disruption to Venezuela's productive base and a collapse in consumer spending, we project further contractions in real GDP in 2018-20, following an estimated contraction of 13.9% in 2017. Our forecast recovery in 2021-22 rests on the assumption of a political transition that, supported by IMF financial and institutional assistance, produces a credible macroeconomic programme with improved management of the country's oil wealth at its centre. However, the reform programme will be limited in scope by a weak government, and we only expect a partial rebound in real GDP, following a decline of over 50% in 2013-20.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2018, reflecting the effect on real wages of hyperinflation as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will continue to contract as well, reflecting the difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. Our forecast for a recovery in investment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition and a pick-up in investment in the oil sector. Oil output-already in the midst of a long decline owing to mismanagement and underinvestment-has contracted beyond expectations in recent months; we now expect it to bottom out at 1.2m barrels/day (b/d) in early 2020, down from an average of 1.95m b/d in 2017. Under our baseline forecast of openness to foreign investment under a new government from around 2019, oil production will start a recovery in the second half of 2020, but will remain well below 2m b/d even at the end of our forecast period in 2022. Export volumes will only start to recover in 2021, as an increase in domestic demand, which has been artificially constrained, will initially absorb the increase in oil output. For the same reason, import demand will rise sharply.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
A decimation of domestic supply, severe limits on imports and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official data have not been published since 2015, but the opposition-led National Assembly has estimated that monthly inflation was 80% in April, bringing year-on-year inflation to over 13,000%. We expect inflation to average over 10,000% in 2018. There is a high risk of a hyperinflationary spiral in coming months that increases inflation to well above our current forecast and necessitates a dramatic adjustment, probably involving a resort to currency substitution.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
Since the start of the year the government has devalued the official exchange rate by over 95%. The rate is supposedly determined by an auction system, but the government-which mono-polises the country's exports-has not supplied the system with foreign-exchange, making the system unsustainable and access to foreign exchange practically impossible, even at the current rates. In early June the black-market exchange rate was around BsF1,200,000:US$1; the official rate stood at BsF90,000:US$1.
Given existing distortions in the foreign-exchange market and growing hyperinflation, the government may, as part of a stabilisation plan, introduce a new domestic currency or attempt some kind of currency substitution in the future. Under our current political assumptions, similar measures may be undertaken after 2019. The exact nature and implementation of the plan is hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
We expect the current-account surplus to reach US$5.6bn in 2018 (2.4% of GDP at the distorted exchange rate, which overstates the GDP in dollar terms), owing to continued import compression. However, Venezuela's lack of access to foreign finance means that the current-account surplus will not be enough to meet the country's financing needs. Indeed, excluding arrears, we calculate that principal repayments of sovereign and state-owned companies' bonded debt alone will amount to US$3.5bn in 2018. As such, we expect further arrears in 2018 and 2019. By 2020, with a new government in power, we expect that-following a debt renegotiation-external financing will be restored and imports will begin a recovery. We expect the surge in imports to tip the current account into a deficit of 6.3% of GDP in 2020 at a less highly distorted exchange rate. The restructured interest payment schedule will mean lower outflows, but the slow recovery of the oil sector and years of unmet import demand will mean that the current-account deficit will remain high, at over 5% of GDP in 2021-22.
Assuming that a new administration takes power from around 2019, we expect financial and investment inflows to provide sufficient financing, stabilise balance-of-payments dynamics and help to rebuild reserves coverage. However, there are considerable risks to this rosy outlook. In addition to assuming a pragmatic unity government capable of retaining power, it hinges on a substantial assistance package from the IMF, the quick implementation of a successful macroeconomic stabilisation package, the fast resolution of a debt renegotiation process in 2019-20, substantial inflows of financial and real investment into the economy in 2020-22, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

Abstract: The PJ's divisions have until now worked in the government's favour, allowing the government to pursue its legislative agenda with the support of moderate Peronists. [...]Mr Macri has remained relatively popular, with voters giving him the benefit of the doubt on the need for economic adjustment. [...]we have made modest revisions in the past month to show a laxer than expected primary deficit target of 1.3% of GDP in 2019 (versus our expectation of 0.8% of GDP) under the Fund deal. According to our baseline forecast, this will happen towards the end of 2020. [...]at end-2017 the real effective exchange rate was 14% stronger than the average of the previous 20 years.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The ruling centre-right Cambiemos coalition government is under increasing political pressure amid recent currency volatility and an IMF bailout (the Fund is unpopular in Argentina), but will be hoping to get its policy agenda back on track in time for the presidential election, when the president, Mauricio Macri, will seek a second term. However, the opposition will increasingly obstruct policy. Cambiemos lacks a congressional majority, meaning that the administration has to negotiate support for its legislative agenda on an ad hoc basis with various factions of Argentina's dominant Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party).
Currency depreciation pressure amid an emerging-market sell-off has introduced substantial political uncertainty, but major changes to economic policymaking are not envisaged under the terms of the IMF lending arrangement, other than a more rapid tightening of fiscal policy. The US$50bn stand-by arrangement was approved on June 20th and includes targets for a tightening of fiscal policy to produce a primary fiscal balance by 2020 (in order to contain growth in the public debt/GDP ratio and reduce inflationary deficit financing), and provisions for central-bank target independence to be enshrined in law, to help to tackle the inflation problem (the root of Argentina's external competitiveness problem, which is in turn driving devaluation pressures). The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that programme targets will be met, and will gradually reduce inflation and engender macro-economic stability over time.
A spike in interest rates and a tightening of fiscal policy amid currency pressures will weigh on economic activity, and we have revised our forecast for real GDP growth in 2018 to 1.6%, down from 2.3% previously. For now, our view of medium-term GDP growth remains broadly unchanged, although the risks to our forecasts have risen substantially. Under our benign baseline forecast, we expect growth to fluctuate around 3% in 2020-22.
More front-loaded currency weakening than previously projected will provide some boost to external competitiveness, but even so, the current-account deficit will remain large in 2018, and import cover will dip from 7.6 months to around seven months this year. Thereafter, we expect the current-account deficit to narrow steadily to just below 3% of GDP in 2022.
Argentina's GDP per head is among the highest in the region and, combined with improved access to credit, moderate rates of economic growth in the medium term will boost purchasing power and create market opportunities. Still-high poverty rates and income inequality will restrict the pool of consumers, but to a lesser extent than in many other countries in the region.

Argentina's global business environment score improves in 2018-22, and the country jumps 12 places in our global ranking. Economic policy adjustment is under way as the government works to tighten macroeconomic policy, reduce state intervention in the private sector and encourage private investment. However, in many areas improvements will take time to materialise.
Country forecast overview: Argentina's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: The administration of Mauricio Macri works to address key weaknesses, including weak competition policy, the heavy burden of red tape and restrictive price controls.
2020-22: Continued work to build faith in legal and regulatory frameworks. State participation in key sectors continues.
Policy toward foreign investment
2018-19: Proactive, welcoming approach to foreign investment. Attempts to resolve outstanding disputes with creditors.
2020-22: Foreign direct investment is welcome. Improvement made in investment dispute settlement and availability of investment-protection schemes.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Continued efforts to improve the workings of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union) and develop closer relations with the Pacific Alliance, comprising Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.
2020-22: Possibility that new free-trade agreements are signed.
Taxes
2018-19: Further gradual reductions of export taxes to encourage domestic supply. Tax reforms to promote investment and reduce tax pressure.
2020-22: Comprehensive tax reform to improve federal-provincial revenue sharing a possibility, but obstacles to reform persist. System remains complex, despite recent reforms.
Financing
2018-19: Banking penetration remains weak and long-term credit restricted, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, owing to weak long-term deposit base.
2020-22: Non-bank financing grows, but is constrained by a relatively small pool of institutional investors.
The labour market
2018-19: Tension with unions, owing to inflation. Political and bargaining power of unions remains strong.
2020-22: Limited progress on labour reform. Continued potential for conflicts with unions. Some skills shortages.
Infrastructure
2018-19: The Macri administration continues to improve contract rights and deficient regulatory regimes.
2020-22: Some public and private investment set to improve energy supply and upgrade export infrastructure, but the risk of energy shortages will persist as demand grows.
Technological readiness
2018-19: Quality of e-commerce business environment good. Upgrade of 4G capabilities.
2020-22: More progress on increasing scope of e-government as part of process to reduce red tape. Increase in research and development spending as percentage of GDP, but still relatively low compared with more developed markets.

Background: Democracy was restored to Argentina in 1983, after 50 years of instability and military regimes. Economic liberalisation in the 1990s drove firm growth, but an inflexible exchange-rate mechanism and fail-ure to deepen structural reform left the economy vulnerable to shocks, contributing to the collapse in 2001 of Fernando de la Rúa's centre-left government. An interim government took power until Néstor Kirchner of the Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party) began a term in 2003. He presided over an economic rebound, which enabled his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, to win the presidency in 2007 and secure re-election in 2011. Economic policy mismanage-ment drove a change of government in 2015, with a centre-right candidate, Mauricio Macri, taking office in December 2015.
Political structure: A strong presidential system is in theory checked by a bicameral Congress, comprising a 257-member Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and a 72-member Senate (the upper house); in practice, however, the presidency dominates. The presidential term is four years. There are 23 provinces and the Buenos Aires federal district, each with its own government.
Policy issues: Pro-cyclical expansionary policies and the commodity supercycle contributed to GDP growth of an annual average 6.6% in 2005-11. But expansionary policy also produced significant imbalances. Amid currency pressures, the Fernández government resorted to controls and ad hoc interventionism, to the detriment of the business environment. These policies did not reduce devaluation speculation, and left the economy extremely vulnerable to currency crisis. Macroeconomic adjustments to try to reduce economic distortions are taking place under Mr Macri; these include the shift to a free float at the end of 2015, fiscal and monetary tightening, and reforms to boost domestic supply, but the pace of adjustment has been insufficient to prevent severe currency pressure, and in mid-2018 the government was forced to turn to the IMF for a stand-by lending arrangement involving tighter fiscal targets.
Taxation: The value-added tax (VAT) rate is 21%, although VAT on some goods and services is charged at a lower rate of 10.5%, and some services are taxed at a higher rate of 27%. Corporate income tax is levied at 35%, and personal income tax at progressive rates between 9% and 35%. Under a tax reform approved at end-2017, the corporate income tax rate will fall to 30% in 2019 and 25% in 2021. There is a 0.6% tax on financial transactions (deposits and withdrawals).
Foreign trade: The current account moved from surplus to deficit in 2010. By 2017 the deficit had widened to 4.8% of GDP.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
Argentina was hit hard by an emerging-market sell-off in May, and although turbulence in the foreign-exchange market has subsided with the announce-ment of a US$50bn IMF stand-by lending arrangement, recent developments could have lasting political consequences for the government. The Fund is supportive of Argentina, and The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect dramatic changes in the course of economic policy, which is already geared towards macroeconomic and microeconomic reforms to restore stability and promote more solid, stable economic growth. The problem for the president, Mauricio Macri, and his ruling centre-right Cambiemos coalition, is that the Fund has a very poor reputation in Argentina, reflecting its role before and after the country's deep economic crisis of 2001-02. Argentina's return to the Fund will, therefore, weigh on the government's approval ratings, and will embolden the opposition, with less than 18 months to go until the presidential election.
The government will be hoping to get its policy agenda back on track in time for the presidential election, when Mr Macri will seek a second term. However, the opposition will be smelling blood and will increasingly obstruct policy. Cambiemos lacks a congressional majority, meaning that the administration has to negotiate legislative support on an ad hoc basis with various factions of the Partido Justicialista (PJ, the Peronist party). The PJ, which dominated politics for decades before Mr Macri's election victory in 2015, is struggling to regroup from that defeat and is beset by internal divisions. The party is currently split between a left-wing, populist faction and a centrist faction that, as yet, has no single, clear leader. The PJ's divisions have until now worked in the government's favour, allowing the government to pursue its legislative agenda with the support of moderate Peronists. Moreover, until now Mr Macri has remained relatively popular, with voters giving him the benefit of the doubt on the need for economic adjustment. But patience is wearing thin.
In this environment, the opposition will begin manoeuvring for position ahead of the presidential election, and the government will now struggle to push its agenda through. In the aftermath of its strong performance in the October 2017 mid-terms, the government moved quickly to pass reforms to the tax system, pensions and competition policy (and in May managed to pass capital market reforms). But in coming months, major reforms will be on hold, and opposition challenges to policy initiatives that are presented will increase. All this means that much-needed reforms to increase the flexibility of labour markets, improve the effective-ness of the judiciary, and enhance investor confidence in institutions and contract rights will be on the back burner. On our current assumption that Mr Macri wins a second term in 2019, we expect that improvements in these areas will start to yield results more clearly late on in our five-year forecast period.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
The next presidential election is due in October 2019. Notwithstanding the president's current difficulties, we currently continue to assume that Mr Macri will win a second four-year term, based on our assumption of moderate GDP growth and substantial reduction of inflation by then. There are large, and growing, risks to this forecast. Reflecting the difficulties faced by minority governments in Argentina, no non-Peronist government has won a second consecutive term since the end of the military dictatorship in the 1980s. The emergence of a strong challenger from the Peronist party is therefore likely (although it is as yet unclear who this will be), and the election will be closely fought.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Reflecting efforts by the Macri government to repair relations with trade and investment partners in the region and elsewhere, and we expect relations with key partners to remain strong. The country took over the rotating presidency of the G20 in December 2017, and is pursuing an agenda centred on the future of jobs, infrastructure and food security. The government is keen to seek trade deals under the auspices of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union). The problem for Argentina and its Mercosur partners is that, just as the grouping has started to reverse its own protectionist tendencies, anti-globalisation sentiment has grown in the OECD. However, Mr Macri is continuing to seek support for an EU-Mercosur trade deal from his counterparts in Europe, and negotiations are continuing, although they are slow moving. In the meantime, Mercosur members including Argentina have pushed for free-trade negotiations elsewhere, including with Canada and China, and for closer relations with the Pacific Alliance free-trade area. All of these negotiations are also likely to move slowly, however.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Currency depreciation pressure amid an emerging-market sell-off has intro-duced substantial political uncertainty, but major changes to economic policymaking are not envisaged under the terms of the IMF lending arrangement, other than a more rapid tightening of fiscal policy. The govern-ment has made progress since it came to office at the end of 2015 and began grappling with the task of restoring macroeconomic stability while improving conditions for busi-ness. But macroeconomic adjustment is clearly incomplete: inflation came in at 26.3% in May, amid continued utilities tariff rises (intended to reduce the fiscal burden of subsidies and promote investment by bringing utilities prices towards market rates), and the fiscal deficit remains substantial, at 6% of GDP in 2017.
Still-high inflation has contributed to currency over-valuation, which has in turn produced a large and growing current-account deficit. These imbalances have contributed to the sharp peso adjustment of the past two months, and to the government's decision to seek an IMF lending deal to restore market confidence. The US$50bn stand-by arrangement was approved on June 20th and an initial disbursement of US$15bn was made available immediately for deficit financing and to help to restore reserves coverage ratios. The government may treat the deal as precautionary going forward, and future drawdowns will depend on market access. The deal includes targets for a tightening of fiscal policy to produce a primary fiscal balance by 2020 (in order to contain growth in the public debt/GDP ratio and reduce inflationary deficit financing), and provisions for central-bank target independence to be enshrined in law, to help to tackle the inflation problem (the root of Argentina's external competitiveness problem, which is in turn driving devaluation pressures).
We expect that programme targets will be met, and will gradually reduce inflation and engender macro-economic stability over time. This will have positive implications for the external sector and growth. The biggest risks to this outlook are political, and reflect the possibility that voter (as well as business) confidence in the Macri admin-istration and the economic outlook feeds into further market volatility and economic activity. This would not only complicate the adjustment process, but also threaten our assumption that Mr Macri will secure a second term in power, raising questions as to the future direction of economic policy under a new government.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
In its first two years of office the government pursued gradual fiscal tightening (so as not to thwart economic growth), but, in the face of market pressure, it has now accelerated the pace of adjustment under the auspices of the Fund deal. The fiscal targets set out in the deal were broadly in line with our expectations and allow for a relatively gradual adjustment. In fact, we have made modest revisions in the past month to show a laxer than expected primary deficit target of 1.3% of GDP in 2019 (versus our expectation of 0.8% of GDP) under the Fund deal. This partly reflects provisions that allow for increased social safety net expenditure.
Bearing in mind that the government beat its fiscal target in the first five months of 2018 by a substantial margin, the 2018 target should not be difficult to meet, although it will require cuts to planned capital spending, which will have a knock-on impact on economic growth. Apart from capital spending, expenditure restraint will come via a phasing out of costly energy subsidies and the recent approval of a social security reform that will produce substantial savings (0.4% of GDP per year from 2018). The biggest risks to meeting the fiscal target centre on the government's ability to maintain public-sector wage restraint amid above-target inflation and strong public-sector union power, as well as below-target revenue, reflecting an expected deceleration of economic activity this year.
The government is-for now at least-facing a problem with liquidity rather than solvency. With the benefit of US$50bn in IMF lending, and assuming that market access improves as currency pressure subsides (and in the aftermath of Argentina's recent upgrade from "frontier" to "emerging" market status in the MSCI index (MSCI is an index provider whose classifications are widely used by global investors), which will allow for increased capital inflows from institutional investors), financing the fiscal deficit should not prove problematic. However, the public debt/GDP ratio is likely to continue to rise in 2018 to just over 60% of GDP, before stabilising in the remainder of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The Banco Central de la República Argentina (BCRA, the central bank) has tight-ened monetary policy sharply to help to stem currency pressures, and will unwind its rate rises only very slowly. Over little more than a week at the start of May the bank raised the policy rate by 1,275 basis points, to 40%. Further currency depreciation is possible in the short term, and further rate rises remain a risk (although for now we expect rates to stay on hold). Recent sharp policy tightening will eventually restore some calm, allowing the central bank to begin to unwind its dramatic rate rise over the next few months. This process will be complicated, however, by weak confidence in the nascent inflation-targeting regime, which means that inflation expectations are not well anchored and pass-through from currency depreciation into consumer prices is relatively high.
Weak confidence in the inflation target reflects several factors, but important among them is the government's own strategic error of relaxing the 2018 inflation target at the end of 2017. The government states that this change was geared at making the inflation target more realistic, but resultant perceptions of discord between the government and the central bank have damaged domestic confidence in the inflation target. This led in June to the departure of the central bank president, Federico Sturzenegger, in an effort to restore credibility in policymaking. His replacement, the former finance minister, Luis Caputo, is well known and well regarded, but more than staffing changes, real progress on disinflation will be required to restore confidence in monetary policymaking.
The BCRA has been clear in its view that current price pressures are temporary, and we share this view. But in the meantime, the latest rapid slide in the currency will feed through to a spike in prices in May-June. We do still expect monthly inflation to start to ease towards 1% on a con-sistent basis late in 2018, once the effects of currency depreciation and tariff adjustment start to fade. This should allow for gradual monetary easing, taking the nominal policy rate to slightly above 30% by year-end. Our forecasts thereafter assume moderately positive real interest rates in the medium term.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Although the latest data show that growth remained firm in the first quarter of 2018, at 1.1% on a seasonally adjusted sequential basis, activity will be hit hard in the second quarter, not just by tighter macroeconomic policy and the jolt to confidence following the currency turmoil and IMF bail-out, but also by the effects of a severe drought, which will hit the harvest of two key crops, soya and maize. Agriculture accounts for a fairly hefty 11% of GDP, and agro-industry is also important to the economy. Reflecting new data showing that the negative effect of the drought will be stronger in the second quarter than we previously expected, we have revised our forecast for real GDP growth in 2018 down substantially this month, to 1.6%, from 2.3% previously. Growth will remain weak in the second half of 2018, and will provide less momentum going into 2019, and on this basis, we have also revised downward our GDP forecast for next year fairly substantially, from 2.9% to 2.3%. For now our forecasts for the second part of the forecast period (2020-22) are unchanged, although the risks to our forecasts have risen substantially. Under our benign baseline forecast, we expect growth to fluctuate around 3% 2020-22, staying below 3% in 2020 amid a projected cyclical downturn in the US, before accelerating back above 3% in 2021-22. This projected acceleration rests on the assumption that that implementation of recently passed and ongoing structural reforms will gradually boost economic activity. There is increasing downside risk to this assumption, in the form of a weakening of consumer and business confidence, and the potential for a much more tense presidential election period in 2019.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
The reduction of inflation will continue to be complicated in the short term by gradual increases in utilities tariffs as these are brought closer in line with market prices. On top of this, rapid recent peso depreciation, in a context of unanchored inflation expectations, will produce substantial pass-through effects, keeping inflation high in the very short term. However, assuming that macroeconomic policy remains tight under the auspices of the IMF deal, domestic demand remains subdued relative to the boom years of 2004-11, and domestic supply strengthens on the back of an improved regulatory environment for agricultural and other producers, we continue to expect gradual disinflation in the medium term. It will take quite some time, however, for inflation to fall to single-digit levels. According to our baseline forecast, this will happen towards the end of 2020.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
The peso has been badly hit in the past two months as investors that had previously given the administration the benefit of the doubt over its ability to reverse macroeconomic imbalances zeroed in on the country's large fiscal and current-account deficits. The latter reflects clear overvaluation of the peso, a problem that worsened last year as huge inflows of portfolio capital produced real currency appreciation. As a result, at end-2017 the real effective exchange rate was 14% stronger than the average of the previous 20 years. Recent currency adjustment will go some way to reversing this trend, assuming that disinflation occurs as expected from late 2018. In the short term, we believe that co-ordinated efforts by the government and the central bank to regain the confidence of investors will be successful in preventing an uncontrolled devaluation of the peso in coming weeks. However, we expect the peso to continue to depreciate in both nominal and real terms, to address the problem of currency overvaluation. Under our baseline forecast, the currency will depreciate to Ps28.4:US$1 at end-2018 and Ps37.7:US$1 at end-2022. There remains a high risk, however, of much sharper currency weakening in coming months.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
More front-loaded currency weakening than previously projected will provide some boost to external competitiveness, but even so, in 2018 the current-account deficit will remain large, with the boost to net exports of goods and services becoming more evident from 2019. Even in 2022 we expect the current-account deficit to remain substantial (although more manageable), at 2.8% of GDP. After a period of huge inflows of portfolio capital in 2016-17, access to finance will be trickier and more costly in 2018-19; meanwhile, inflows of foreign direct investment will average an unspectacular 2.1% of GDP in 2018-22. This will be reflected in import cover, which recovered from a low of just four months to 7.6 months in 2017, but will dip back to seven months in 2018-22, even assuming that reserves recover slightly in the rest of 2018 from their recent lows of around US$50bn.

Abstract: First phase of third airport in Istanbul, the capital, becomes operational. A presidential system of government will come into effect after snap elections in June 2018. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president and leader of the AKP, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkey's involvement in the conflict in neighbouring Syria will continue to influence the direction of Turkey's foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly regarding the conflict in Syria, where they are co-operating but have been pursuing contrasting goals. [...]the central government deficit, which captures most of the public-sector expenses, expanded from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to 1.5% in 2017.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Turkey is due to hold early parliamentary and presidential elections on June 24th 2018, ahead of the original date in late 2019.
The elections were brought forward in the light of growing economic uncertainties; the still high popularity of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the ruling Justice and Development (AKP) party; and the rise in nationalist sentiment in the context of Turkey's military operations in northern Syria.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Mr Erdogan and the AKP to win the elections and remain in power throughout the forecast period (2018-22).
After the elections an executive presidency will replace the current parliamentary system of government. The new system will provide only few checks on the president's powers.
The AKP has enjoyed 15 years of single-party rule, and for most of that period political and government effectiveness have improved. However, since 2013 economic policymaking institutions have become increasingly politicised.
Uncertainty about the direction of Turkey's economic policy continues to cloud the country's medium-term economic outlook. The government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign-policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate.
Since the failed coup in 2016 there has been a marked deterioration in Turkey's relations with its Western allies. We expect a complete rupture to be avoided, but tensions will remain high.
We forecast a slowdown in real GDP growth from 7.3% in 2017 to a still robust 4.2% per year on average in 2018-22, reflecting higher taxes, higher interest rates, a gradual tightening of global liquidity and more moderate export growth.
We expect an annual average government budget deficit of 3% of GDP on average in 2018-19. We forecast that the budget deficit will narrow gradually, to 1.8% of GDP in 2022, as fiscal revenue increases.
We expect the current-account deficit to widen in 2018, to 6.6% of GDP, before contracting to a still large 4.7% per year on average in 2019-22. Turkey will struggle to meet its important external financing needs if global liquidity is constrained and investor confidence deteriorates.

Turkey's score deteriorates only slightly in 2018-22, but in the global rankings the country falls by 11 places, to 60th. There is consensus among policymakers on the need to maintain macroeconomic stability. However, the failed coup and the government's response have increased the level of uncertainty about the direction of policy. Shortcomings include a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Privatisations are likely to be delayed amid the post-coup upheaval in the state institutions. Some companies, notably those with media holdings or ties with the Gulenist movement, remain subject to heavy-handed state intervention.
2020-22: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2020-22: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Capital controls are not considered. There is a boost to trade and tourism following the lifting of Russian sanctions.
2020-22: Negotiations with the EU to update the customs union are likely to be protracted given poor Turkish-EU relations.
Taxes
2018-19: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Some tax rate rises, including on company profits, are introduced in 2018 to curb the widening of the budget deficit.
2020-22: Income tax base becomes broader as exemptions and exceptions are reduced.
Financing
2018-19: Political pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey not to raise interest rates significantly remains possible. Risk of the US imposing fines on several Turkish banks over alleged violations of US sanctions on Iran.
2020-22: Banking system remains stable, despite weaknesses. Heavy reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2018-19: Relatively high labour costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment.
2020-22: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2018-19: First phase of third airport in Istanbul, the capital, becomes operational. Slower progress made on other projects.
2020-22: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks might persist.
Technological readiness
2018-19: Spending on research and development remains moderate at about 1% of GDP, holding back efforts to move the economy up the value-added ladder.
2020-22: Turkey's young population spurs further rapid digital transformation of the banking sector.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe (in 1949) and NATO (in 1952), and signed an association agreement with the then European Community (in 1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but the coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey currently has a unicameral parliamentary system of government, with parliament elected for a four-year term. To win seats parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. A presidential system of government will come into effect after snap elections in June 2018. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president and leader of the AKP, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability is Turkey's biggest policy challenge. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and changing global liquidity conditions require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy relatively tight to attract adequate capital inflows. The Kurdish problem, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is one of Turkey's most pressing policy issues, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015, and there has been a resurgence in violence. The failed coup highlighted institutional weaknesses that, with the AKP's consent until 2013, had allowed the secretive Gulenist movement to infiltrate the state. Politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The basic rate of corporation tax has been raised in 2018, from 20% to 22%. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Tax reform to reduce evasion was one of the main elements of previous IMF reform programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2017 goods exports (fob) came to US$166bn and imports (fob) to US$225bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$59bn-a sharp widening from US$41bn in 2016. The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
On April 18th, after many conflicting statements, the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, of the ruling religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), called early presidential and parliamentary elections. Both votes will be held on June 24th, well ahead of the originally scheduled date of November 2019, as the president seeks to take advantage of his current popularity. The vote will conclude Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. This move was initiated with a constitutional referendum in April 2017, which the government narrowly won. Under the new system the president will be granted wide-ranging executive powers, including in the selection of the majority of top officials in the judiciary, and parliament will be greatly weakened. Municipal elections are still due in March 2019. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that the AKP and Mr Erdogan, who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, will win the elections and remain in power until 2024, and possibly beyond.
The elections will take place under emergency rule. This was initially introduced after the failed coup attempt to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric who is accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. Emergency rule has allowed Mr Erdogan to govern as a president with executive powers until the new system of government is fully in place. It has also allowed the government to continue its campaign against political opponents, critics and perceived enemies of the state, to curtail freedoms of expression, assembly and association, and to politicise the judiciary. Similar to the situation at the April 2017 referendum, the state of emergency is likely to provide an advantage to Mr Erdogan and the AKP in what will be a highly contested election. Recent changes to the electoral law, including an amendment allowing the use of unstamped ballots, raise the risk of electoral fraud and an illegitimate election outcome. Against this backdrop, the credibility of the election will probably be challenged, which will further polarise the country and increase risks to political and social stability. Although an unlikely prospect, failure by Mr Erdogan and the AKP to win both the presidential and parliamentary elections could throw the political system into chaos and open up irreparable divisions in the AKP.
The operational capacity problems created by the purge of the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) and the police after the attempted coup in July 2016 appear to have eased to a large extent, but security risk remains high. Turkey is vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Islamic State (IS). Neither the government nor the PKK are interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will return to 1980s levels. Turkey's military operations in Syria are seeking to block the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds affiliated with the PKK, but risk further fuelling the conflict with the PKK in Turkey's south-east. Failure by the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) to surpass the high 10% threshold for entry to parliament could exacerbate tensions in the south-east. The defeat of IS in Syria and Iraq could result in renewed attacks in Turkey and elsewhere.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
The parliamentary and presidential elections will be held on June 24th, earlier than the originally scheduled date of late 2019. The elections were brought forward in the light of the high and growing economic uncertainties, the still high popularity of Mr Erdogan and the AKP, and the rise in nationalist sentiment in the context of Turkey's military operations in northern Syria.
The AKP, in alliance with the Nationalist Action Party (MHP), will face a non-negligible challenge from an opposition that, despite being ideologically diverse, is rallying around a shared "anti-Erdogan" view. The opposition alliance includes the Republican People's Party (CHP); the recently formed Good Party (IP), a group that broke away from the MHP following the MHP's support of the constitutional referendum; the smaller, conservative Islamic Felicity Party (SP); and the Democratic Party (DP). The HDP has not joined the alliance.
The AKP's hegemonic position in Turkish politics has suffered in recent years, but we expect Mr Erdogan and his party to win the presidential election and garner a coalition majority (with the MHP) in the parliamentary election. The opposition is fragmented, Mr Erdogan's popularity is unrivalled and he has the support of the right-wing, nationalist MHP. Importantly, the AKP also has the ability to control the election process through the state of emergency rule.
If Mr Erdogan fails to pass the 50% threshold in the first round of the presidential election on June 24th a second-round run-off would be held on July 8th between Mr Erdogan and the candidate with the second-largest share of votes. In the unlikely case that Mr Erdogan wins the presidential vote but the AKP-MHP coalition loses the parliamentary election, it is likely that the president would call a second parliamentary and presidential election.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign policy sphere. There is a risk of a rupture in the country's ties with its traditional Western allies, compounding these allies' concerns that under Mr Erdogan Turkey is pivoting eastwards towards Russia, China and Iran. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration in relations, including a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup; the US's military backing of PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurdish groups; the Turkish government's authoritarian tendencies and its strident anti-Western rhetoric; tensions over gas exploration in the eastern Mediterranean; Turkey's forging of closer relations with non-Western countries; and, more recently, growing tensions with Israel in the aftermath of the US's decision to relocate its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Turkey's confrontational approach to its traditional Western allies should also be viewed in the context of Mr Erdogan's need to maintain the support of the country's nationalists to achieve his domestic political goals-notably, to become president with executive powers after the elections.
The country's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and increasingly transactional rather than strategic, but we expect Turkey and its Western allies to avoid a complete breakdown in relations. However, this might become unavoidable if the EU suspends Turkey's moribund accession negotiations, the migrant deal with the EU collapses, the US imposes sanctions on Turkey over violations by Turkish banks of US sanctions against Iran, or Turkey closes the Incirlik air base to US forces or withdraws from NATO, none of which can be ruled out. Operation Olive Branch, Turkey's crossborder military operation in Afrin in north-western Syria that was launched in January 2018, has accentuated tensions with the US. The operation cleared the area of US-backed, PKK-affiliated Kurdish groups that are intent on establishing a continuous autonomous region along Syria's northern border with Turkey.
Turkey's involvement in the conflict in neighbouring Syria will continue to influence the direction of Turkey's foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly regarding the conflict in Syria, where they are co-operating but have been pursuing contrasting goals. We expect relations to continue to be largely transactional. The risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Turkey's economy has shown resilience during past bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing largely to the country's solid public finances, its well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector and its dynamic, diversified private business sector. However, an intensification of domestic political instability, rising regional tensions and tightening global liquidity con-ditions could disrupt foreign capital inflows during the forecast period (2018-22).
These inflows are needed to meet the country's large external financing requirements (savings have always been low), but tend to be short-term and highly volatile. Shifts in capital flows triggered by expectations of tighter US monetary policy and geopolitical tensions in the neighbouring region have put the lira under severe pressure on several occasions since late 2016, most recently in May 2018, fuelling an acceleration in inflation as well as increasing the cost to firms of servicing their foreign debt (in local currency terms) and thereby raising the risk of defaults for corporates.
Uncertainty about the direction of Turkey's economic policy continues to cloud the country's medium-term economic outlook. The government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. The current direction of policy appears to be towards fiscal loosening and relatively tight monetary policy.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios-reflecting the positive impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past and major upward revisions to Turkey's national accounts-have given the government some leeway to loosen fiscal policy to support the economy in the aftermath of the attempted coup. As a result, the central government deficit, which captures most of the public-sector expenses, expanded from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to 1.5% in 2017. Despite a series of tax increases this year, increased government spending on defence, security, infrastructure projects, public employment and social benefits will cause the deficit to widen further, to an annual average of 3% of GDP in 2018-19, before gradually narrowing to 1.8% in 2022. We expect the central government debt/GDP ratio to decline gradually, from 28.3% of GDP at end-2017 to 26.5% in 2022. Our baseline forecast is predicated on the assumption that fiscal policy will be kept relatively tight, especially after the presidential and parliamentary elections, to support investor confidence.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The Central Bank of Turkey will have to keep its monetary policy tight in 2018 in order to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent further depreciation of the lira amid political volatility, higher US interest rates and balance sheet tapering by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank). A 300-basis-point rise of the late liquidity window lending rate on May 23rd and an announcement on May 28th to simplify the central bank's monetary policy framework suggest that for the time being economic orthodoxy is overcoming political pressures not to raise interest rates ahead of the June elections. We continue to expect that after the presidential and parliamentary elections the Central Bank of Turkey will have additional leeway to respond to currency weakness and inflationary pressures. However, we do not expect this relatively larger capacity will be sufficient to enable the Central Bank of Turkey to raise interest rates to levels that would be credible in bringing inflation down to its 5% target. In the light of Mr Erdogan's unorthodox comments on interest rates, further political pressures against significantly tighter monetary policy cannot be ruled out. In the context of rising regional tensions, tightening global liquidity conditions and rising inflation in the short term, this could prevent the central bank from maintaining investor confidence if financial conditions deteriorate, possibly prompting the imposition of capital controls; however, this is not our baseline scenario.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Real GDP growth accelerated sharply, from an annual average of 3.3% in 2016 to 7.3% in 2017, supported by government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand. In 2018 we expect growth to slow to 4%. This deceleration reflects the impact of tax increases, higher interest rates, a gradual tightening of global liquidity feeding into a weaker currency, increased domestic instability and higher inflation, all of which will offset planned stimulus measures to boost employment and investment. There are considerable downside risks to our forecast, stemming from foreign capital inflows being deterred by further political instability in the transition to a presidential system of government, regional tensions, domestic financial fragilities and the higher interest rate environment in advanced economies. We forecast that GDP growth will average 4.3% per year in 2019-22.
We forecast that household consumption growth will moderate from 6% of GDP in 2017 to a still solid 3.7% per year in 2018-22 as a result of higher interest rates and slower employment growth. We expect government consumption growth to accelerate from 5% in 2017 to an annual average of 5.8% in 2018-19, easing to a more moderate but still robust 4.8% in 2020-22.
The deterioration in the business environment and foreign investors' confidence since the attempted coup in July 2016 and an increase in the corporation tax rate to 22% from 2018 will continue to hold down private-sector fixed investment growth. However, we expect this to be offset by government investment, especially in infrastructure. In 2020-22 we forecast a deceleration in yearly investment growth, reflecting public-sector retrenchment and firms' response to a more moderate expansion of domestic and external demand.
The lifting in June 2017 of Russian sanctions on Turkey (especially in the tourism sector), the positive effect of a weaker lira on export competitiveness and strong external demand have contributed to a rebound in exports of goods and services. However, we expect export growth to slow in 2018-22. Our expectations of a steady nominal weakening of the lira during the forecast period will dampen import growth and support external competitiveness.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Consumer price inflation is stubbornly high-well above the official 5% medium-term target, at 11.9% year on year in May 2018. Reflecting the political constraints on the ability of the central bank to tighten monetary policy further, the recent depreciation of the lira and rising global commodity prices, we believe that inflation will average 11.9% this year. This this is based on the assumption that inflation will peak at about 14% year on year in the third quarter and fall to 12.1% by the end of the year. We believe that inflation will decline gradually in the forecast period, reaching 8% in 2022. There are significant upside risks to our revised forecast if the lira depreciates much more rapidly than we are currently forecasting.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
The lira lost about 17% of its value against the US dollar in 2017. In 2018 we expect a further depreciation of about 15% in the light of high political uncertainty and decreasing foreign investors' confidence. This pace of depreciation assumes a relatively benign political environment after the presidential and parliamentary elections, a mild shift by the authorities to a more conservative economic stance, a gradual tightening of global monetary conditions and relatively tight domestic monetary conditions. Shocks to any of these assumptions, such as the broad global sell-off in emerging-market assets in April-May 2018 after a faster pick-up in nominal yields in the US, would lead to a more abrupt depreciation. In 2019-22 we expect the pace of depreciation to slow in nominal terms. This will result in a mild appreciation in real terms after six consecutive years of real effective depreciations. We expect the lira to average TL4.90:US$1 in 2022, compared with TL3.65:US$1 in 2017.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
Owing to particularly large trade deficits at the end of 2017 and in early 2018, the weakness of the lira and rising global commodity prices, we expect the current-account deficit to widen from 5.6% of GDP in 2017 to 6.6% of GDP this year. However, moderating capital inflows will keep the lira weak and interest rates relatively high, contributing to a slowdown in import demand and a consequent narrowing of the current-account deficit during the forecast period. Turkey's substantial external financing needs will be difficult to meet if global liquidity is constrained and investor confidence deteriorates further. We expect the rebound in tourist arrivals in 2017 to continue, but they will remain vulnerable to a possible resurgence of terrorist attacks in the country.

Abstract: [...]it is looking increasingly likely that Mrs May will opt to stay in a customs union with the EU for an extended period, and that the UK will therefore remain subject to the rules of the single market in many areas. [...]if Mrs May opts to stay in an EU customs union and accept single market rules, the outcome would be finely balanced between the Conservatives accepting a "softer" Brexit, and pro-Brexit members of the government moving to oust her, leading to a pre-term vote. Since April, most opinion polls have put the Conservatives ahead of Labour by a few percentage points, and Labour's poor performance in the local elections in May suggest that it would struggle to win a snap general election. 2013a 2014a 2015a 2016a 2017a 2018b 2019b 2020b 2021b 2022b Monetary indicators Exchange rate US$:£ (av) 1.56 1.65 1.53 1.35 1.29 1.39 1.38 1.36 1.38 1.41 Exchange rate [euro]:£ (av) 1.18 1.24 1.38 1.22 1.14 1.14 1.15 1.12 1.13 1.14 Exchange rate US$:[euro] (av) 1.33 1.33 1.11 1.11 1.13 1.21 1.20 1.21 1.21 1.24 Exchange rate [euro]:£ (year-end) 1.20 1.28 1.35 1.17 1.13 1.16 1.14 1.12 1.13 1.14 Real effective exchange rate (av; 2005=100) 104.1 110.9 117.7 104.8 99.7 102.1 102.8 100.5 101.9 103.5 M4 money supply growth (%)c 0.7 -0.1 0.7 6.2 4.8 2.3 2.8 4.2 3.0 3.4 Domestic credit growth (%) -3.3 -3.1 0.3 4.2 5.4 2.9 1.6 3.6 2.2 3.0 Purchasing power parity US$:£ (av) 1.44 1.43 1.43 1.43 1.42 1.43 1.45 1.44 1.45 1.46 3-month £-Libor rate (av; %) 0.5 0.5 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.8 1.1 1.4 1.8 2.1 10-year government bond yield (av; %) 2.4 2.6 1.9 1.3 1.2 1.6 2.0 2.4 2.6 3.0 Bank of England base rate (%; end-period) 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.25 Lending rate (%; average mortgage SVR from UK MFIs) 4.4 4.5 4.5 4.4 4.4 4.3 4.7 4.9 5.1 5.3 Deposit rate (av; %) 2.6 2.0 1.6 1.3 0.9 1.0 1.2 1.5 1.9 2.3 a Actual.b Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts.c Headline broad money (M4) figures from Bank of England include deposits of "intermediate other financial corporations" (IOFCs) that specialise in intermediation between banks, giving a distorted measure of underlying M4 growth. 2013a 2014a 2015a 2016a 2017a 2018b 2019b 2020b 2021b 2022b The labour market (av) Labour force (m) 32.5 32.8 33.1 33.4 33.5 33.7 33.7 33.8 33.9 34.0 Labour force (% change) 0.8 0.8 0.9 0.9 0.5 0.4 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 Employment (m) 30.0 30.8 31.3 31.7 32.1 32.2 32.3 32.5 32.6 32.6 Employment (% change) 1.2 2.4 1.7 1.4 1.0 0.6 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.1 Unemployment (m) 2.5 2.0 1.8 1.6 1.5 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.3 1.3 Unemployment rate (%; EU/OECD standardised measure) 7.6 6.2 5.4 4.9 4.4 4.2 4.1 3.9 3.8 3.9 Wage and price inflation (% except labour costs per hour) GDP deflator 1.9 1.7 0.5 2.0 2.0 1.4 0.7 1.4 0.9 0.9 Consumer prices (av; CPIH measure) 2.3 1.5 0.4 1.0 2.6 2.4 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 Producer prices (av) 1.3 0.0 -1.7 0.5 3.4 3.0 2.7 2.2 2.2 2.3 GDP deflator (av) 1.9 1.7 0.5 2.0 2.0 1.4 0.7 1.4 0.9 0.9 Private consumption deflator (av) 2.4 1.9 0.6 1.4 2.0 1.6 0.8 1.5 1.5 0.9 Government consumption deflator (av) 0.5 0.6 0.2 1.2 1.3 0.4 0.0 0.0 0.6 0.7 Fixed investment deflator (av) 2.0 1.4 1.3 1.6 2.0 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 Average nominal wages (av) 1.1 1.1 2.6 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.5 Average real wages (av) -1.2 -0.3 2.2 1.4 -0.2 0.0 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.3 Unit labour costs (£-based; av) 1.9 -0.9 0.7 2.2 2.5 2.6 2.4 3.0 2.4 2.3 Unit labour costs (US$-based) 0.6 4.3 -6.5 -9.4 -2.5 10.4 1.7 1.3 4.0 5.0 Labour costs per hour (£) 20.1c 20.2c 20.8c 21.4c 22.1c 22.6 23.1 23.6 24.1 24.8 Labour costs per hour (US$) 31.4c 33.3c 31.8c 28.9c 28.4c 31.3 31.8 32.0 33.2 35.0 a Actual.b Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts.c Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Following a snap general election in June 2017, in which the Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority, the prime minister, Theresa May, formed a minority government based on a "confidence and supply" agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect it to last a full five-year term; its working majority of 13 (down from 17 before the election) will be eroded by by-elections, and it will face domestic and external challenges during the Brexit process.
Mrs May will continue to face difficulties in reconciling opposing factions in her cabinet, who have very different views about negotiating the UK's future relationship with the EU. An important milestone in the Brexit negotiations came in March 2018 when EU leaders approved the terms of the transition period, which will last for 21 months from when the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. However, divisions in the cabinet and on the Conservative backbenches over Brexit are likely to persist in 2018-19.
Completing the agreement on the terms of the UK's withdrawal will take priority in 2018, but talks on the future trading relationship will also begin. The government intends to leave the single market but may remain in a customs union with the EU for an extended period. The outcome of this decision would then be finely balanced between the UK accepting a "softer" Brexit and a snap election that would install a pro-Brexit government that pursues a tougher line in negotiations. Under both scenarios we expect the UK to reach a free-trade agree-ment with the EU by 2021, although the scope of the agreement would vary.
The economy has been resilient in the wake of the Brexit vote, growing by 1.9% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017, but is likely to lose further momentum in 2018-19 as rising inflation and uncertainty about the Brexit negotiations dampen domestic demand. We forecast average annual real GDP growth of 1.5% in 2018-19, picking up to an average of 1.7% per year in 2020-22.
The government's budget deficit narrowed from 4.3% of GDP in 2015 to 1.9% of GDP in 2017. We expect a further gradual contraction in the 2018-22 forecast period, with the deficit reaching 1% of GDP in 2022. The Bank of England (BoE, the central bank) has signalled a readiness to raise interest rates again after doing so in November 2017 for the first time in a decade, and we expect the next increase to take place in August 2018.

The UK's business environment score improves in 2018-22 compared with 2013-17, lifting the country by five places in the global ranking and by four places in the regional ranking. Brexit introduces policy uncertainty, but the UK's strengths-a pro-business policy orientation, a welcoming attitude to foreign investment, and flexible labour and product markets-will endure.
Country forecast overview: United Kingdom's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government retains large stake in Royal Bank of Scotland. Public support for energy and rail sector renationalisation.
2020-22: Shake-up of regulatory and competition frameworks post-Brexit. Continued state support underpins house prices.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Reduced foreign investor activity. Government "assurances" encourage investment in the automotive sector.
2020-22: Infrastructure plans offer investment opportunities. Likely changes in tax policies to bolster inward investment.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: UK formally leaves the EU, but likely transitional agreement to end-2020 implies that status quo arrangements largely continue. Tensions over Irish border. Talks begin on UK-EU free-trade agreement. Modest risk of no deal and hard Brexit.
2020-22: Expected decline in UK-EU crossborder trade. Some new UK-EU trading arrangement possibly phased in.
Taxes
2018-19: Gradual rise in personal income tax allowance, but also in total tax burden. Modest changes to business rates.
2020-22: Planned cut in corporation tax rate to 17%. Ongoing efforts to reduce revenue lost to growing tax avoidance and evasion. Possible changes to value-added tax (VAT) framework if UK leaves the EU's VAT regime after 2020.
Financing
2018-19: Monetary policy is tightened gradually but remains highly accommodative. "Ring-fencing" bank reforms and ongoing capital strengthening (ahead of 2019 deadlines). Steady growth in alternative forms of debt financing.
2020-22: Expected loss of "passporting" rights and restrictions on EU services trade. Modest decline in City of London status.
The labour market
2018-19: Firms defer some hiring decisions amid Brexit uncertainty. Phased increase in compulsory "national living wage".
2020-22: Some restrictions on free movement of labour from EU, but likely to be flexible in response to business concerns.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Modest rise in spending on housing, roads and digital infrastructure. Crossrail service in London begins operation.
2020-22: Construction of high-speed rail link between London and the north of England. EU-funded investment falls.
Technological readiness
2018-19: UK performs well in terms of high e-commerce penetration and strong research base, but research and development (R&D) spending below EU average and limited provision of e-government services. Continued high threat from cyber-crime and cyber-espionage.
2020-22: Possible weakening of research and innovation framework owing to exit from-or more restricted access to-EU structural programmes (such as Horizon 2020) and project financing schemes. Modest rise in public R&D spending.

Background: The end of the second world war coincided with the decline of the UK as an imperial power. Residual links with former colonial territories, close relations with the US and a separate sense of identity delayed UK membership of the European Community (now the EU) until 1973. Successive governments have resisted closer EU integration. In a referendum in June 2016 the UK electorate voted to leave the EU. The future contours of the UK's relationship with the EU are uncertain, but a diminution of UK influence in the region looks inevitable.
Political structure: The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II. Parliament has an elected House of Commons (the lower house, 650 seats) and a non-elected House of Lords (the upper house, non-fixed membership of about 800). The general election in June 2017 produced a minority centre-right Conservative Party government, dependent on the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) for a working majority. The main opposition Labour Party increased its parliamentary seats by 30 in the June 2017 snap general election, but its ability to compete with the Conservatives will be undermined when the government redraws parliamentary constituency boundaries, which are currently favourable to Labour.
Policy issues: UK economic policy has yet to return to normal after the financial crisis, with an exceptionally loose monetary stance. Real GDP growth slowed modestly in 2016-17 compared with 2015. The fallout from the Brexit vote will dominate the policy agenda; The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to focus efforts on negotiating the terms of its departure from the EU and on reducing the damaging effect on the economy of the uncertainty created by the vote. This has led to a shift in the UK's monetary and fiscal policy mix, with fiscal policies becoming more significant. Managing Brexit could force policymakers to address structural deficiencies in the UK, such as weak productivity.
Taxation: The headline rate of corporation tax has been steadily reduced, from 28% in 2010 to 19% since April 2018. There are three bands of personal income tax, set at 20%, 40% and 45% (the 45% rate came into effect in April 2013, replacing the 50% rate that was introduced in 2010). The standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 20% (raised from 17.5% in 2011). Excise duties on tobacco and alcohol are among the highest in Europe.
Foreign trade: In 2017 exports of goods totalled US$441.2bn and imports amounted to US$615.9bn, resulting in a trade deficit of US$174.7bn. The traditional services surplus rose to US$137.9bn. The overall current-account deficit narrowed in absolute terms, to US$106.4bn, from US$154.9bn in 2016, and fell sharply as a share of GDP, to 4.1%, from 5.8%.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
The decision of the prime minister, Theresa May, to call an early general election in June 2017 backfired disastrously for the Conservative Party, which lost its majority. Mrs May has recently recouped some authority through her handling of a nerve agent attack on a former Russian military intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, on March 4th 2018. The prime minister blamed Russia, rallied the UK's international allies and expelled 23 Russian diplomats from the embassy in London. However, the positive political boost for the prime minister has proved to be short lived. The "Windrush scandal"-in which the children of the post-war generation of immigrants to the UK from the Caribbean were hounded by the authorities for official papers that many did not have, and threatened with deportation-unfolded in late April, prompting criticism of the "hostile environment" policy for immigrants pursued when Mrs May was home secretary in 2010-16. The recent appointment of Sajid Javid as home secretary could help to ease political pressure on the government. Mr Javid is the first home secretary from an ethnic minority and is more liberal than the prime minister on immigration matters. Nevertheless, the Windrush scandal has further weakened Mrs May's authority.
Mrs May will also continue to face difficulties in reconciling opposing factions in the cabinet that have different views about negotiating the UK's future relationship with the EU. Divisions in the cabinet and on the Conservative backbenches over Brexit are likely to persist. A number of Conservative rebels have declared their intention to try to force the government to reverse its position on remaining outside a customs union with the EU. Mrs May has been under pressure to present a viable alternative customs arrangement that minimises trade frictions and is acceptable to the Irish government, avoiding a hard border in Ireland. However, neither of the two options that Mrs May has presented have been acceptable to pro-Brexit members of the government or to the EU. As a result, it is looking increasingly likely that Mrs May will opt to stay in a customs union with the EU for an extended period, and that the UK will therefore remain subject to the rules of the single market in many areas. However, doing so could trigger a revolt by pro-Brexit members of the government, leading to an early election.
Brexiteers in the cabinet will continue to be supportive of Mrs May as long as she holds fast to her pledges to leave the single market, the customs union and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). They will support the prime minister as long as she pursues their vision of Brexit, which includes bilateral free-trade agreements with non-EU countries. However, Mrs May is also under pressure from those advocating a "softer" Brexit and, as an advocate of Remain during the referendum, this may be her preference too. These divisions have sharpened, presenting a threat to government stability in 2018.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
A snap general election in June 2017 resulted in the Conservatives losing 13 seats, leaving them with 318 in the 650-seat House of Commons (the lower house of parliament). The Labour Party won 30 seats in a swing of almost 10 percentage points from the 2015 election, giving it 262 seats. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which increased its share of parlia-mentary seats from eight to ten, became kingmaker.
The Conservatives formed a working government, based on a "confidence and supply" arrangement with Northern Ireland's DUP. This arrangement is likely to work in the short term, because neither party wants another election-they are natural allies on questions of sovereignty and the EU, and the DUP is committed to preventing the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, from coming to power given his past association with Northern Ireland's main nationalist party, Sinn Fein. However, the arrangement is politically fragile.
The next general election is scheduled for May 2022. Lacking a parliamentary majority and divided over Brexit, the government will do well to last until then. However, if Mrs May opts to stay in an EU customs union and accept single market rules, the outcome would be finely balanced between the Conservatives accepting a "softer" Brexit, and pro-Brexit members of the government moving to oust her, leading to a pre-term vote. Since April, most opinion polls have put the Conservatives ahead of Labour by a few percentage points, and Labour's poor performance in the local elections in May suggest that it would struggle to win a snap general election.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
The UK will formally leave the single market at the end of the Article 50 process in March 2019. UK and EU negotiators have reached agreement on large parts of the draft withdrawal agreement that they intend to finalise by October, such as citizens' rights, the financial settlement, Euratom and on most areas relating to separation provisions. There is also full agreement on the terms of the transition period, which will last for 21 months after the UK's formal withdrawal. During this period the UK will maintain access to the single market, but will be bound by the obligations of membership. The UK made several concessions that are unpalatable to Brexiteers: EU law will still be applicable; EU budget contri-butions will continue; the UK will have no say over fishing quotas; and there will be reciprocal free movement and subsequent entitlement to settled status until the end of the transition period. A win for the UK is that it will not be bound by the EU's trade policy, enabling it to negotiate and agree (but not implement) new trade deals during the transition.
There is an increasing risk that the EU and the UK will fail to reach agreement on the Irish border issue, and that this will scupper the withdrawal agreement. Proposals for a "customs partnership" and a "highly streamlined customs arrangement" have so far been met with scepticism and it is looking increasingly likely that the government will implement some form of its "backstop" proposal to effectively keep the UK in a customs union with the EU beyond the end of the transition period in 2021. Under this scenario, the UK would remain subject to single market rules in many areas and the scope of a future trade agreement with the EU would therefore be limited.
However, this would be in breach of Mrs May's "red lines" and could trigger a revolt by Brexiteers, leading to the prime minister's removal, a snap election and the return of a committed pro-Brexit government. The Economist Intelligence Unit would expect a pro-Brexit government to pursue a tougher line in the negotiations and aim for a comprehensive free-trade agreement outside of the single market and customs union. Trade flows with the EU should be facilitated by the close nature of the future trading relationship, which should involve some degree of regulatory alignment. However, a viable alternative solution to the EU customs union would still need to be found, and a hardline stance on both sides would increase the risk of a complete breakdown in the negotiations.
Realistically, only the framework of a trade deal will be agreed by the time the UK withdraws in 2019, as completing the withdrawal agreement will take priority in 2018. However, transition arrangements will allow negotiations to continue, and we expect a deal to be in place by 2021.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
The UK's departure from the EU may encourage policymakers to address some of the structural deficiencies that have held back the economy in recent years, including lacklustre productivity growth, insufficient innovation and poor infra-structure. The chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, announced a National Productivity Investment Fund to boost the UK's digital infrastructure and spending on research and develop-ment over the next five years. Proposals to reform the UK's housing market have focused on introducing greater speed and flexibility into the planning process. We expect these measures to support the recovery in productivity, but they are too modest in scope to close the UK's productivity gap with its G7 peers.
The Queen's Speech in June 2017 set out the government's legislative agenda, which was dominated by Brexit. Eight of the 27 bills relate to the transfer of EU law into British law, a UK customs regime, independent trade policy, controls on immigration, fisheries policy, agricultural policy, nuclear safeguards and the UK's ability to impose international sanctions. In a further sign that Brexit is the government's priority, the parliamentary session will last for two years rather than one, ending two months after the UK's withdrawal at end-March 2019.
The centrepiece of the autumn budget in November 2017 was a sizeable increase in spending on the National Health Service (NHS). In March 2018 Mrs May said that the government would this year draw up a "long-term funding plan" to secure the future of the NHS.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Data suggest that the government has already met its "fiscal mandate" of a structural deficit smaller than 2% of GDP by fiscal year 2020/21. The budget deficit narrowed sharply in 2017, to 1.9%, from 3% of GDP in 2016, owing to strong growth in tax revenue. This implies some scope for higher public spending in the autumn budget statement. However, in the remainder of our forecast period (2018-22) we expect the government to continue to aim to nudge down discretionary spending as a proportion of GDP. We expect the deficit to contract to 1.6% of GDP by 2020 and 1% by 2022. We forecast that public debt will decline from 88% in 2018, to reach 81% by 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
At its meeting in May 2018 the monetary policy committee (MPC) of the Bank of England (BoE, the central bank) voted to keep the main policy interest rate unchanged at 0.5%, seven months after raising it by 25 basis points for the first time in a decade. Seven members of the nine-strong committee supported this position, with two members voting to increase the policy rate by 25 basis points, to 0.75%. The MPC is keen to begin normalising its policy rate, although recent soft economic data are likely to mean that the BoE will delay its next rate rise until August 2018. We expect a gradual tightening cycle to follow, with a series of 25-basis-point increases in the policy rate over the next five years, taking it to 2.25% by end-2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
The economy has been resilient in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Average annual real GDP growth was firm in 2016 and 2017, at 1.9% and 1.8% respectively. However, the annual pace of growth slowed throughout 2017. We expect real GDP growth to average 1.4% in 2018 and to remain broadly stable in 2019, at 1.5%.
We expect the modest slowdown in 2018-19 to be led by a deceleration in domestic demand. Consumer spending will weaken in response to the continued squeeze on real household incomes from high inflation. Consumer spending was fairly resilient to this pressure in 2017, reflecting employment gains, high levels of household borrowing and a decline in the savings ratio. In 2018 we expect employment growth to slow and greater uncertainty about the economic outlook to push up precautionary savings. Consumer spending will recover in 2019-22 as inflation eases, uncertainty recedes and unemployment edges lower. However, increased borrowing costs arising from tighter monetary policy will hold back the pace of the recovery in these years. We forecast that investment spending will decelerate in 2018-19 as a result of heightened un-certainty during difficult Brexit trade negotiations and higher cost pressures as a result of sterling's depreciation, before recovering in 2020-22 as these effects fade.
Mitigating the extent of the domestically driven slowdown in 2018 will be a positive contribution to GDP growth from the external balance as export volumes benefit from a competitiveness boost as a result of sterling's depreciation, while the weaker domestic demand environment reduces import growth. From 2019 we expect the trade balance to exert a drag on GDP growth owing to our forecast for a recovery in domestic demand, which will push up import growth again. Our expectation of a business cycle downturn in the US in 2020 and a deal on the UK's new trading relationship with the EU, which should take effect in 2021 and result in looser trade ties than before, will also constrain exports in 2020-22. We expect real GDP growth to pick up to 1.7% on average in those years.
Trade policy is the biggest risk to our forecast for economic growth globally. The EU received temporary exemption from new US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, announced in March, but the exemption was allowed to expire on June 1st. We expect the EU to retaliate with tariffs of its own on selected US imports, raising the risk that the US responds with tariffs on EU automotive imports. A desire to avoid further escalation to a broader trade war should mean that tit-for-tat measures end there, but risks to this forecast are high.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
The headline rate of annual inflation-as measured by the consumer price index including owner occupiers' housing costs (CPIH)-accelerated to 2.6% on average in 2017, up from 1% in 2016. The increase partially reflects a rebound in oil prices, but has been amplified by the sharp depreciation of sterling since the Brexit vote. The pound has since reversed much of this appreciation and, in response, inflation has decelerated in early 2018. However, we expect the pound to weaken again in 2018-20, and oil prices are rising rapidly this year. We expect inflation to remain above the BoE's official 2% target for much of 2018, averaging 2.4%, even as domestic price pressure weakens. Tighter monetary policy will bring inflation back towards the bank's target from 2019; we forecast that inflation will ease to 1.9% next year and 2.1% on average in 2020-22.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
There was a sharp drop in the external value of sterling after the Brexit vote. Sensitivity in the foreign-exchange markets to the Brexit news flow has contributed to volatility in the value of the pound, which lost further value against both the euro and the US dollar in 2017, although it appreciated sharply against the dollar in early 2018. The pound has been fairly resilient since mid-2017, and we expect it to remain broadly flat against the euro in 2018-19, at about EUR1.14:£1 on average (which compares with EUR1.22:£1 in 2016), before weakening more sharply in 2020-partly reflecting the difficulty in completing Brexit negotiations, but also tighter monetary policy in the euro zone. We then expect it to recover modestly against the euro in 2021-22, as a new UK-EU trade relationship is established.
The pound has recently lost value against the dollar, but remains at a stronger level than in 2017; we expect it to average US$1.39:£1 in 2018, before weakening slightly in 2019-20 and recovering some value in 2021-22.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
The merchandise trade balance will keep the current account in deficit throughout 2018-22, offsetting surpluses on the services account. The current-account deficit narrowed to 4.1% of GDP in 2017, from 5.8% in 2016. We forecast that it will narrow further in 2018, to 3.8%, as a larger services surplus offsets a slightly larger trade deficit. In 2019-20 we expect the current-account deficit to widen to 4.5% on average as domestic demand recovers. From 2021 we expect looser trade relations with the EU to mean a larger goods trade deficit and smaller services surplus, although this will be offset by a reduction in secondary transfers as the UK reduces its contribution to the EU budget. We forecast an annual average current-account deficit of 4.5% of GDP in 2021-22.

Abstract: [...]he led the ÖVP to a plurality of the vote in the early election in October, winning a 31.5% share-up by 7.5 percentage points on its result in 2013. To assuage concerns from Mr Kurz and the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, about the FPÖ's previous Euroscepticism, the party has agreed not to push for a referendum on EU membership. [...]EU policy is handled by the chancellery instead of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is headed by an FPÖ appointee. [...]real GDP growth was 3.1% in 2017-above growth in Germany for the first time since 2005 and Austria's fastest growth rate since 2007. 2013a 2014a 2015a 2016a 2017a 2018b 2019b 2020b 2021b 2022b The labour market (av) Labour force (m) 3.8 3.8 3.9 3.9 4.0 4.0 4.1 4.1 4.1 4.1 Labour force (% change) 1.2 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.3 1.1 0.8 0.4 0.3 0.2 Employment (m) 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.7 3.8 3.8 3.8 3.8 Employment (% change) 0.5 0.6 0.9 1.5 1.9 2.2 1.4 0.8 0.5 0.3 Unemployment (m) 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 Unemployment rate (av; %; national measure) 7.6 8.4 9.1 9.1 8.5 7.5 6.9 6.5 6.3 6.2 Unemployment rate (av; %; EU/OECD standardised measure) 5.3 5.6 5.7 6.0 5.5 4.9 4.4 4.1 4.0 4.0 Wage and price inflation (% except labour costs per hour) GDP deflator 1.6 2.0 2.3 1.1 1.6 1.8 1.6 2.0 1.5 1.3 Consumer prices (av; EU harmonised measure) 2.1 1.5 0.8 1.0 2.2 2.0 1.9 2.1 2.1 2.0 Producer prices (av) -1.1 -2.0 -3.6 -2.4 4.7 2.4 1.5 2.2 2.4 1.8 GDP deflator (av) 1.6 2.0 2.3 1.1 1.6 1.8 1.6 2.0 1.5 1.3 Private consumption deflator (av) 2.1 2.0 1.4 1.2 2.0 2.2 2.1 2.2 2.1 1.9 Government consumption deflator (av) 1.2 1.4 2.2 1.1 1.2 2.0 1.9 2.1 2.1 2.0 Fixed investment deflator (av) 1.8 1.8 1.6 1.4 1.6 1.9 1.9 2.2 2.0 2.1 Average nominal wages 2.6 2.4 2.2 1.6 1.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.7 2.6 Average real wages 0.4 0.9 1.3 0.6 -0.7 0.6 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.6 Unit labour costs ([euro]-based; av) 1.1 0.3 0.2 -0.2 -1.4c 0.3 0.4 0.1 -0.2 -0.5 Unit labour costs (US$-based) 4.4 0.3 -16.3 -0.5 0.6c 7.9 -0.9 0.9 0.0 1.5 Labour costs per hour ([euro]) 33.1 34.0 34.8 35.4 36.0c 37.0 38.1 39.3 40.4 41.5 Labour costs per hour (US$) 44.0 45.2 38.6 39.2 40.7c 45.0 45.7 47.5 49.0 51.4 a Actual.b Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts.c Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
An early election in October 2017 was won by the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), led by the young minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, who has since become chancellor at the head of a majority coalition government of the ÖVP and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to last a full term.
The inclusion of the FPÖ in the government will not lead to significant tensions with other EU member states as it did in 2000, when the party was last part of a coalition. This is largely because of the normalisation of the far right in Europe since then.
The new government will focus on integration and immigration policy, and will attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and introduce some additional flexibility in labour and product markets. Significant structural reforms are unlikely owing to low government cohesion.
We forecast that the government budget will remain in deficit-albeit well within the EU mandated limit of 3% of GDP-throughout the 2018-22 forecast period, as the fiscal consolidation process is likely to be restrained by limited government cohesion and effectiveness. The public debt/GDP ratio will fall gradually, to just above 67% by 2022, from 78.2% in 2017.
After several years of underperformance compared with its regional peers, the economy has performed relatively strongly since the start of 2016, growing by 3.1% in 2017. We forecast a continuation of strong growth this year, at an upwardly revised 2.7%, and for growth to moderate to 1.7% on average in 2019-22.
Consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) will continue to exceed the euro zone average in 2018-22, driven by structural domestic factors including higher unit wage costs and more regulated markets. We expect annual average EU harmonised inflation of 2% in 2018-22.
The current-account surplus has been relatively stable in recent years, at about 2%. Although we expect small changes in the composition of the surplus, we expect it to remain broadly stable, at 2% of GDP on average in 2018-22, driven mainly by a strong surplus on the services balance, supported by tourism inflows.

Austria's business environment score rises between the historical period (2013-17) and the forecast period (2018-22), mainly owing to the improving economy. Austria's strengths as a business location include good infrastructure, stable institutions and co-operative labour relations, but high taxes, limited market opportunities and restrictive regulations will persist.
Country forecast overview: Austria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government works on reducing red tape, but progress is likely to be limited.
2020-22: Modest strengthening of competition authority's powers. Administrative reform reduces red tape. More transparency in antitrust proceedings. Risk of political interference in private firms in which state owns substantial stakes.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Foreign investment is generally welcome, but underlying opposition to takeovers of "national champions" persists.
2020-22: Possible erosion of barriers against foreign takeovers as a result of commercial pressure and EU legislation.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: No exchange controls. Foreign trade, governed by EU rules, should remain liberal.
2020-22: EU maintains focus on bilateral free-trade agreements as multilateral trade negotiations stagnate.
Taxes
2018-19: Limited changes to the tax system aimed at reducing the sizeable income tax wedge.
2020-22: Vested interests will continue to hamper large-scale reform, and the high tax burden will remain.
Financing
2018-19: Financial stability to improve amid tighter regulatory requirements and a reduction in risk from exposure to central and eastern Europe.
2020-22: Further uptake in corporate bond issuance. Credit conditions continue to ease as banks' profitability recovers, in part supported by a gradual uptick in interest rates.
The labour market
2018-19: Economy-wide minimum wage introduced. More stringent requirements for early retirement and invalidity pensions. Labour market slowly improves as increase in labour supply moderates and unemployment continues to fall.
2020-22: Continued modest expansion of labour supply, primarily via net immigration, but concerns about shortage of skilled employees in certain sectors are likely to persist. Early retirement phased out.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Further take-up of broadband services. Gradual improvement of transport links with eastern Europe.
2020-22: Improved transport network connecting main urban centres and providing better access to the country's interior. Gradual transition to low-carbon economy entails significant changes to electricity transmission infrastructure.
Technological readiness
2018-19: Internet use remains slightly below several regional peers, but research and development remains relatively high.
2020-22: Further progress made on upgrading the large manufacturing sector to take advantage of new technologies.

Background: Austria became an important force in central Europe with the formation of the Habsburg empire in the 15th century and remained so until the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the first world war. The Republic of Austria emerged in 1918. In 1938 Austria was incorporated into the German Third Reich. With the departure of the victorious Allied forces in 1955, it regained independence as a neutral country. In the post-war period Austria took great strides to catch up economically with the rest of the developed world and is now one of the most advanced nations. It is a member of the EU and a participant in the economic and monetary union (EMU).
Political structure: Austria is a federal republic, and the head of state is the federal president. The government is led by the federal chancellor. The national parliament has two houses: the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house), of 62 members appointed by state parliaments, and the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house), which has 183 members elected by proportional representation. An early general election was held on October 15th 2017.
Policy issues: The government will focus on migration and integration issues, including in the EU context. It will also attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and implement other measures to improve the business environment, including through enabling more flexibility in the labour market.
Taxation: Austrian labour tax as a percentage of GDP is among the highest in the EU. A 2016 tax reform lowered the tax burden for low- and middle-income earners, but raised the top personal income tax rate from 50% to 55%. Social security contributions, shared between employers and employees, are high. Corporation tax is levied at a rate of 25%. Dividend and investment income is subject to a withholding tax of 27.5%. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a standard rate of 20%, and a reduced rate of 13% (raised from 10% in 2016) applies for certain goods and services.
Foreign trade: Trade relations are dominated by Germany, which accounts for about a third of total imports and exports. The current-account surplus is driven by strong tourism exports boosting the services surplus. We expect modest current-account surpluses throughout the forecast period.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
The governing coalition consists of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). The Economist Intelligence Unit expects this coalition to prove relatively stable and to sit out its full term until 2022. This follows several years of little progress on reforms and coalition (as well as party) in-fighting under the grand coalition of the ÖVP and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ), which fell apart in May 2017. The popular 31-year-old minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, took over the leadership of the ÖVP, reformed the party around himself and moved it closer to the FPÖ on issues such as immigration and integration. As a result, he led the ÖVP to a plurality of the vote in the early election in October, winning a 31.5% share-up by 7.5 percentage points on its result in 2013. The SPÖ's vote share was unchanged, at 26.9%. The FPÖ increased its share of the vote by 5.5 percentage points, to 26%. The liberal NEOS returned to parliament with just over 5% of the vote, and the Greens failed to cross the 4% electoral threshold for the first time in 31 years, in part because List Pilz, led by a former leader of the Greens, narrowly managed to cross it.
In mid-December, after just over a month and a half of negotiations, the ÖVP and the FPÖ formed a coalition. Under Mr Kurz the ÖVP has moved closer to the FPÖ in many policy areas, and the negotiations thus went relatively smoothly. To assuage concerns from Mr Kurz and the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, about the FPÖ's previous Euroscepticism, the party has agreed not to push for a referendum on EU membership. Moreover, EU policy is handled by the chancellery instead of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is headed by an FPÖ appointee.
The chancellor is from the ÖVP, but the election was nevertheless a decisive moment in the fraying of the decades-long dominance of the political scene by the SPÖ and the ÖVP, as the ÖVP has, to a large extent, been replaced by Mr Kurz's new movement. The two parties had together ruled the country almost continuously since 1945, but a renewed grand coalition had become almost impossible following a breakdown in relations and the reform gridlock in recent years. The FPÖ has profited from this and from concerns about immigration, although Mr Kurz also owes much of his popularity to his strong stance on this issue and his plans to curtail migration into Europe and Austria.
Despite the overlap between the ÖVP's and the FPÖ's programmes, we do not expect the government to implement significant structural reforms, as the coalition partners are likely to disagree on economic matters, on which they are significantly less well aligned than they are on social and cultural matters. In addition, the FPÖ could struggle to translate its opposition stance on topics such as immigration and integration into concrete policy proposals. The initial phase of the government's term is likely to be relatively smooth, owing in part to the country's role as president of the Council of the European Union in the second half of 2018. Later in the term the FPÖ might struggle to distinguish itself from the ÖVP, which could lead to tensions between the parties, creating a moderate risk of an early election.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
The most recent general election was held on October 15th 2017. Unless the government falls before then-an eventuality to which we assign a low risk-it will sit in the Nationalrat (the lower house of parliament) until the end of its term in late 2022. The next election for the primarily ceremonial post of federal president will be in 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Austria was severely affected by the European migrant crisis, and this has been the dominant issue in its domestic politics and international relations since 2015. The country has been at the centre of many of the intra-EU spats regarding the bloc's response to the large influx of migrants, owing in part to its unilateral actions, including the leading role that it played in closing the migration route through the Balkans. Domestic pressure on the government to be seen as acting against this inflow, and thus often against other EU member states, will remain high. The new government plans to cut child benefit payments flowing abroad, potentially leading to tensions with eastern member states in particular.
Nevertheless, Mr Kurz has been at pains to point out that his government will be pro-EU, and that Austria's EU membership will not be questioned in the coming years. The government plans for Austria to be a leading voice in the bloc in the coming years, especially on migration reform, which should be facilitated by the country's role as president of the Council of the European Union. We expect the government to find broad support for proposals such as tighter controls of the EU's outer borders and processing asylum applications outside the EU.
Although the previous inclusion of the FPÖ, in 2000, led to sanctions being imposed by other EU nations, the reception has been more muted this time. On the previously occasion a far-right nationalist party entering government was an unusual development, but since then sister parties to the FPÖ have either entered government or supported minority governments in several EU countries, including some Nordic countries and the Netherlands. However, this will at times lead to tensions with fellow EU members, as shown by the fact that a number of countries are now sharing less intelligence with Austria because the ministries concerned are headed by the FPÖ.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
The new government plans to move integration and immigration policy further to the right, including through curtailing benefits for asylum-seekers and cutting child benefits that are sent abroad. It has also presented plans that focus on improving the business environment, including by reducing corporate tax rates and introducing more flexible working hours. Furthermore, it plans to cut a number of labour market programmes aimed at the long-term unemployed and integrating migrants into the labour market. Although it has announced a push to centralise and streamline the welfare system-to which several major stakeholders, including state governors, are likely to object-it does not plan to reform the country's so-called Proporz system, under which the ÖVP and the SPÖ had apportioned public life (state companies, public services, subsidies, regulatory responsibilities). This is despite suggestions from both coalition parties-especially the FPÖ-in the past that they would want to do this. We therefore expect reform momentum to be limited and that the government will struggle to implement significant structural reforms rapidly.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Driven by both a lacklustre recovery following the financial and euro zone crises and a lack of fiscal consolidation, the fiscal accounts have remained in modest deficit in recent years and within the 3% of GDP limit set by the EU. Strong growth contributed to a narrowing of the deficit to 0.7% of GDP in 2017.
The government plans to reach a small budget surplus in 2019 by cutting spending and at the same time reducing income taxes and the country's sizeable tax wedge. However, it has not yet clearly outlined the spending cuts that it intends to make, barring a number of smaller measures, including cutting spending on asylum-seekers, and we therefore do not share the government's optimism that a surplus can be reached in 2019. Nevertheless, continued robust economic growth will contribute to a further narrowing of the deficit in the coming years; we expect it to average 0.4% of GDP in 2018-22.
The public debt stock as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline gradually, from 78.2% in 2017 to just above 67% in 2022. Although the public finances will remain worse than in peers such as Germany or the Netherlands, the low interest rate environment and Austria's relatively strong fundamentals mean that funding risks are extremely low, in our view.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The European Central Bank (ECB) is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a quantitative easing (QE) programme that ran at EUR60bn per month until the end of 2017, and is running at EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018. However, the ECB's view of the outlook improved markedly during 2017 and, although it remains dovish, we expect a more upbeat tone to emerge this year, and an end to monthly asset purchases under the QE programme at the end of 2018. Rising commodity prices and evidence of building domestic price pressure in some parts of the euro zone should mean that sufficient inflationary pressures will begin to emerge on the policy horizon in 2019-20. In response, we expect the ECB to take steps towards normalising its policy stance with an increase of 25 basis points in the main refinancing rate to 0.25% in early 2020, followed by five more rises that will lift the main refinancing rate to 1.5% by end-2022. An increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019, easing the pressure on banks' lending margins and supporting profitability.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Austria's initial recovery from the global financial crisis was respectable in the euro zone context, but subsequently the economy stalled and under-performed compared with regional peers, notably Germany. This was particularly striking given the traditionally high level of synchronisation between the two countries' business cycles. A faltering reform process in recent years contributed to higher inflation compared with regional peers and weakened productivity growth, admittedly from fairly high levels. However, the economic recovery gained significant momentum from the second half of 2016. Although in previous years the labour market had struggled to integrate the significant increase in the labour force, it seemed to have turned a corner in late 2016 and early 2017, owing in part to a surge in employment in the manufacturing sector. We expect a continued gradual improvement in labour market indicators in the coming years. This is supporting private consumption, which we expect to grow by 1.7% this year. Export and investment growth have also picked up. As a result, real GDP growth was 3.1% in 2017-above growth in Germany for the first time since 2005 and Austria's fastest growth rate since 2007.
We expect the current phase of catch-up growth-following an under-performance compared with fundamentals in recent years-to continue this year, although we forecast slower real GDP growth, of 2.7%, as we expect the impulse from the manufacturing sector in 2017 to have largely been a one-off. In the following years we expect a further moderation of growth, to around the economy's potential growth rate of about 1.7%. Driven by the improvement of the labour market, domestic demand will be the main driver of growth. Investment will also make a significant contribution to growth in the first half of the forecast period (2018-22), as business investment continues its recent pick-up after several weak years, and as increasing labour shortages push firms to invest more. We expect average real GDP growth of 1.7% per year in 2019-22. Govern-ment policy is likely to be supportive of growth in the coming years, and the main risks are external. As a highly open economy, Austria is vulner-able to global economic developments, including any shocks to global trade in the case of a potential trade war between the US and the EU.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Annual consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) has been subdued in recent years, but higher than in most other euro zone countries. Inflation averaged 0.9% in 2015-16-well above average inflation in Germany and the euro zone. This largely reflects structural domestic factors such as higher unit wage costs, more regulated markets, and a period of faster increases in taxes and duties. Rising services prices and energy price base effects caused a gradual increase in inflation in 2017, leading to a full-year average of 2.2%. The recent strengthening of the euro will weigh slightly on inflation, but we expect price growth to stay above the euro zone average in 2018-22, at 2% on average, as similar structural factors as seen in previous years persist.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
For most of 2015-16 the euro moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1, before a sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following the presidential election in the US led to a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1. However, in 2017 the euro rallied as the region's economic recovery strengthened and expectations of QE tapering rose--and as political risk waned in Europe but rose in the US. The exchange rate peaked at almost US$1.25:EUR1 at the beginning of February 2018 and has weakened slightly since then. The value of the euro could yet come under pressure from political risk-especially in the wake of the March 2018 general election in Italy-and monetary tightening in the US. Nevertheless, we expect a gradual appreciation on average, to US$1.21:EUR1 by 2020-21, as the euro is supported by a continued recovery in the region and receives structural support from a large current-account surplus, while the business cycle downturn in the US will weigh on the value of the dollar in 2020. Thereafter we expect the euro to appreciate to US$1.24:EUR1 on average in 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
Low oil prices and subdued domestic demand compressing import values have helped the trade balance to move into surplus in recent years, from a deficit in 2009-13. However, the increase in oil prices in 2017 pushed it back into a modest deficit. We expect the trade account to remain around balance, but in deficit, throughout the forecast period. The main driver of the current-account surplus will therefore be the healthy surplus on the services balance, driven in large part by robust tourist inflows. This will ensure that the current-account surplus remains broadly flat throughout 2018-22, at 2% of GDP on average.

Abstract: The government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. Since the failed coup in 2016 there has been a marked deterioration in Turkey's relations with its Western allies. A presidential system of government will come into effect after snap elections in June 2018. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president and leader of the AKP, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkey's involvement in the conflict in neighbouring Syria will continue to influence the direction of Turkey's foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly regarding the conflict in Syria, where they are co-operating but have been pursuing contrasting goals. [...]the central government deficit, which captures most of the public sector, expanded from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to 1.5% in 2017.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Turkey is due to hold early parliamentary and presidential elections on June 24th 2018, ahead of the original date in late 2019.
The elections were brought forward in the light of the serious and growing economic uncertainties, the still high popularity of Mr Erdogan and the ruling Justice and Development (AKP) party, and the rise in nationalist sentiment in the context of Turkey's military operations in northern Syria.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Mr Erdogan and the AKP to win the elections and remain in power throughout our forecast period (2018-22).
After the elections an executive presidency will replace the current parliamentary system of government. The new system will provide only few checks on the president's powers.
The AKP has enjoyed 15 years of single-party rule, and for most of that period political and government effectiveness have improved. However, since 2013 economic policymaking institutions have become increasingly politicised.
Uncertainty about the direction of Turkey's economic policy continues to cloud the country's medium-term economic outlook. The government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate.
Since the failed coup in 2016 there has been a marked deterioration in Turkey's relations with its Western allies. We expect a complete rupture to be avoided, but tensions will remain high.
We forecast a slowdown in real GDP growth from 7.3% in 2017 to a still robust 4.2% per year on average in 2018-22, reflecting higher taxes, higher interest rates, a gradual tightening of global liquidity and more moderate export growth.
We expect an annual average government budget deficit of 3% of GDP on average in 2018-19. We forecast that the budget deficit will narrow gradually, to 1.9% of GDP in 2022, as fiscal revenue increases.
We expect the current-account deficit to widen in 2018, to 6.5% of GDP, before contracting to a still large 4.7% per year on average in 2019-22. Turkey will struggle to meet its important external financing needs if global liquidity is constrained and investor confidence deteriorates.

Turkey's score deteriorates only slightly in 2018-22, but in the global rankings the country falls by 11 places, to 60th. There is consensus among policymakers on the need to maintain macroeconomic stability. However, the failed coup and the government's response have increased the level of uncertainty about the direction of policy. Shortcomings include a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Privatisations are likely to be delayed amid the post-coup upheaval in the state institutions. Some companies, notably those with media holdings or ties with the Gulenist movement, remain subject to heavy-handed state intervention.
2020-22: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2020-22: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Capital controls are not considered. There is a boost to trade and tourism following the lifting of Russian sanctions.
2020-22: Negotiations with the EU to update the customs union are likely to be protracted given poor Turkish-EU relations.
Taxes
2018-19: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Some tax rate rises, including on company profits, are introduced in 2018 to curb the widening of the budget deficit.
2020-22: Income tax base becomes broader as exemptions and exceptions are reduced.
Financing
2018-19: Political pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey not to raise interest rates continues. Risk of the US imposing fines on several Turkish banks over alleged violations of US sanctions on Iran.
2020-22: Banking system remains stable, despite weaknesses. Heavy reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2018-19: Relatively high labour costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment.
2020-22: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2018-19: First phase of third airport in Istanbul becomes operational. Slower progress made on other projects.
2020-22: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks might persist.
Technological readiness
2018-19: Spending on research and development remains moderate at about 1% of GDP, holding back efforts to move the economy up the value-added ladder.
2020-22: Turkey's young population spurs further rapid digital transformation of the banking sector.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe (in 1949) and NATO (in 1952), and signed an association agreement with the then European Community (in 1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but the coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey currently has a unicameral parliamentary system of government, with parliament elected for a four-year term. To win seats parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. A presidential system of government will come into effect after snap elections in June 2018. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president and leader of the AKP, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability is Turkey's biggest policy challenge. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and changing global liquidity conditions require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy relatively tight to attract adequate capital inflows. The Kurdish problem, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is one of Turkey's most pressing policy issues, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015, and there has been a resurgence in violence. The failed coup highlighted institutional weaknesses that, with the AKP's consent until 2013, had allowed the secretive Gulenist movement to infiltrate the state. Politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The basic rate of corporation tax has been raised in 2018, from 20% to 22%. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Tax reform to reduce evasion was one of the main elements of previous IMF reform programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2017 goods exports (fob) came to US$166bn and imports (fob) to US$225bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$59bn-a sharp widening from US$41bn in 2016. The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
On April 18th, after many conflicting statements, the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, of the ruling religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), called early presidential and parliamentary elections. Both votes will be held on June 24th, well ahead of the originally scheduled date of November 2019, as the president seeks to take advantage of his current popularity. The vote will conclude Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. This move was initiated with a constitutional referendum in April 2017, which the government narrowly won. Under the new system, the president will be granted wide-ranging executive powers, including in the selection of the majority of top officials in the judiciary, and parliament will be greatly weakened. Municipal elections are still due in March 2019. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that the AKP and Mr Erdogan, who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, will win the elections and remain in power until 2024, and possibly beyond.
The elections will take place under emergency rule. This was initially introduced after the failed coup attempt to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric who is accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. Emergency rule has allowed Mr Erdogan to govern as a president with executive powers until the new system of government is fully in place. It has also allowed the government to continue its campaign against political opponents, critics and perceived enemies of the state, to curtail freedoms of expression, assembly and association, and to politicise the judiciary. Similar to the situation at the April 2017 referendum, the state of emergency is likely to provide an advantage to Mr Erdogan and the AKP in what will be a highly contested election. Recent changes to the electoral law, including an amendment allowing the use of unstamped ballots, raise the risk of electoral fraud and of an illegitimate election outcome. Against this backdrop, the credibility of the election will probably be challenged, which will further polarise the country and increase risks to political and social stability. Although an unlikely prospect, failure by Mr Erdogan and the AKP to win both the presidential and parliamentary elections could throw the political system into chaos and open up irreparable divisions in the AKP.
The operational capacity problems created by the purge of the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) and the police after the attempted coup appear to have eased to a large extent, but security risk remains high. Turkey is vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Islamic State (IS). Neither the government nor the PKK are interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will return to 1980s levels. Turkey's military operations in Syria are seeking to block the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds affiliated with the PKK, but risk further fuelling the conflict with the PKK in Turkey's south-east. Failure by the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) to surpass the high 10% threshold for entry to parliament could exacerbate tensions in the south-east. The defeat of IS in Syria and Iraq could result in renewed attacks in Turkey and elsewhere.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
The parliamentary and presidential elections will be held on June 24th, earlier than the originally scheduled date of late 2019. The elections were brought forward in the light of the high and growing economic uncertainties, the still high popularity of Mr Erdogan and the AKP, and the favourable rise in nationalist sentiment in the context of the government's military operations in northern Syria.
The AKP, in alliance with the Nationalist Action Party (MHP), will face a non-negligible challenge from an opposition that, despite being ideologically diverse, is rallying around a shared "anti-Erdogan" view. The alliance includes the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP); the recently formed Good Party (IP), a group that broke away from the MHP following the MHP's support of the constitutional referendum; the smaller, conservative Islamic Felicity Party (SP); and the Democratic Party (DP). The HDP has not joined the alliance.
The AKP's hegemonic position in Turkish politics has suffered in recent years, but we expect Mr Erdogan and his party to win the presidential and parliamentary elections. The opposition is fragmented, Mr Erdogan's popularity is still unrivalled and he has the support of the right-wing MHP. Importantly, the AKP also has the ability to control the election process.
If Mr Erdogan fails to pass the 50% threshold in the first round of the presidential election on June 24th a second-round run-off would be held on July 8th between Mr Erdogan and the candidate with the second-largest share of votes. In this round he would be likely to face Muharrem Ince, the CHP candidate, although a face-off against the IP candidate, Meral Aksener, cannot be ruled out. In both cases the second-round run-off would be turned into a deeply polarising referendum on Mr Erdogan's leadership. In the unlikely case that Mr Erdogan won the presidential vote but the AKP-MHP coalition lost the parliamentary election, a second parliamentary and presidential election (under the revised constitution presidential and parliamentary elections must be held simultaneously) would be likely to be called by the president.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign policy sphere. There is a risk of a rupture in the country's ties with its traditional Western allies, compounding these allies' concerns that under Mr Erdogan Turkey is pivoting eastwards towards Russia, China and Iran. Many factors have contributed to the deterioration in relations, including a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup; the US's military backing of PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurdish groups; the Turkish government's authoritarian tendencies and its strident anti-Western rhetoric; tensions over gas exploration in the eastern Mediterranean; Turkey's forging of closer relations with non-Western countries; and, more recently, growing tensions with Israel in the aftermath of the US's decision to relocate its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Turkey's confrontational approach to its traditional Western allies should also be viewed in the context of Mr Erdogan's need to maintain the support of the country's nationalists to achieve his domestic political goals-notably, to become president with executive powers after the elections.
The country's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and increasingly transactional rather than strategic, but we expect Turkey and its Western allies to avoid a complete breakdown in relations. However, this might become unavoidable if the EU suspends the country's moribund accession negotiations, the migrant deal with the EU collapses, the US imposes sanctions on Turkey over violations by Turkish banks of US sanctions against Iran, Turkey closes the Incirlik air base to US forces, or it withdraws from NATO, none of which can be ruled out completely. Operation Olive Branch, Turkey's crossborder military operation in Afrin in north-western Syria that was launched in January 2018, has accentuated tensions with the US. The operation cleared the area of US-backed, PKK-affiliated Kurdish groups that are intent on establishing a continuous autonomous region along Syria's northern border with Turkey.
Turkey's involvement in the conflict in neighbouring Syria will continue to influence the direction of Turkey's foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly regarding the conflict in Syria, where they are co-operating but have been pursuing contrasting goals. We expect relations to continue to be largely transactional. The risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Turkey's economy has shown resilience during past bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing largely to the country's solid public finances, its well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector and its dynamic, diversified private business sector. However, an intensification of domestic political instability, rising regional tensions and tightening global liquidity con-ditions could disrupt foreign capital inflows during the forecast period (2018-22). These inflows are needed to meet the country's large external financing requirements (savings have always been very low), but tend to be short term and highly volatile. Shifts in capital flows triggered by expectations of tighter US monetary policy and geopolitical tensions in the neighbouring region have put the lira under severe pressure on several occasions since late 2016, most recently in May 2018, fuelling an acceleration in inflation, increasing the cost to firms of servicing their foreign debt and raising the risk of defaults for corporates.
Uncertainty about the direction of Turkey's economic policy continues to cloud the country's medium-term economic outlook. The government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. The current direction of policy appears to be towards fiscal loosening and relatively tight monetary policy through unconventional measures.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios-reflecting the positive impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past and major upward revisions to Turkey's national accounts-have given the government some leeway to loosen fiscal policy to support the economy in the aftermath of the attempted coup. As a result, the central government deficit, which captures most of the public sector, expanded from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to 1.5% in 2017. Despite a series of tax increases this year, increased government spending on defence, security, infrastructure projects, public employment and social benefits will cause the deficit to widen further, to an average of 3% of GDP in 2018-19, before narrowing to 1.9% in 2022. We expect the central government debt/GDP ratio to decline gradually, to about 27% in 2022. Our baseline forecast is predicated on the assumption that fiscal policy will be kept relatively tight, especially after the presidential and parliamentary elections, to support investor confidence.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The Central Bank of Turkey will have to keep its monetary policy tight in 2018 in order to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent further depreciation of the lira amid political volatility, higher US interest rates and balance sheet tapering by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank). However, because of political pressure not to raise interest rates further, we expect the Central Bank of Turkey to be constrained in its ability to raise interest rates to levels that would be credible in bringing inflation down to its 5% target. Nonetheless, we expect that after the presidential and general elections, the bank will have some increased leeway to possibly tighten its policy stance, albeit via unorthodox and less effective tools. Our baseline forecast is that this mild tightening will help to contain the depreciation of the lira. However, in the context of rising regional tensions, tightening global liquidity conditions and rising inflation in the short term, this may be insufficient to maintain investor confidence and could prompt a hard landing in the second half of 2018; however, this is not our baseline scenario.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Real GDP growth accelerated sharply, from an annual average of 3.3% in 2016 to 7.3% in 2017, supported by government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand. In 2018 we expect growth to slow to 4% (revised from 4.5% previously). This deceleration reflects the impact of tax increases, higher interest rates, a gradual tightening of global liquidity feeding into a weaker currency, increased domestic instability and higher inflation, all of which will offset planned stimulus measures to boost employment and investment. There are considerable downside risks to our forecast, stemming from foreign capital inflows being deterred by further political instability in the transition to a presidential system of government, regional tensions, domestic financial fragilities and the higher interest rate environment in advanced economies. We forecast that GDP growth will average 4.3% in 2019-22.
We forecast that household consumption growth will moderate from 6% of GDP in 2017 to a still solid 3.7% per year in 2018-22 as a result of higher interest rates and slower employment growth. We expect government consumption growth to accelerate from 5% in 2017 to an annual average of 5.8% in 2018-19, easing to a more moderate, but still robust, 4.8% in 2020-22.
The deterioration in the business environment since the attempted coup and an increase in the corporation tax rate to 22% from 2018 will continue to hold down private-sector fixed investment growth. However, we expect this to be offset by government investment, especially in infrastructure. In 2020-22 we forecast a deceleration in yearly investment growth, reflecting public-sector retrenchment and firms' response to a more moderate expansion of domestic and external demand.
The lifting of Russian sanctions on Turkey (especially in the tourism sector), the positive effect of a weaker lira on export competitiveness and strong external demand have contributed to a rebound in exports of goods and services. However, we expect growth to slow from 11.9% in 2017 to an annual average of 4.4% in 2018-22, reflecting base effects and our view that 2017 probably represented the recent peak in the global trade cycle. Our expectations of a steady nominal weakening of the lira during the forecast period will dampen import growth.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Consumer price inflation is stubbornly high-well above the official 5% medium-term target. Reflecting the political constraints on the ability of the central bank to tighten monetary policy further, the recent depreciation of the lira and rising global commodity prices, we have revised our 2018 inflation forecast to 11.8% (from 10.2% previously). This implies inflation peaking at about 14% in the third quarter and falling to 12% by the end of the year. We believe that inflation will decline gradually in the forecast period, reaching 8% in 2022. There are significant upside risks to our revised forecast if the lira depreciates much more rapidly than we are now forecasting.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
We have revised our exchange-rate forecast for 2018-22. We now expect the lira to average TL4.90:US$1 in 2022 (TL4.79:US1 previously), compared with TL3.65:US$1 in 2017. After a fall in the nominal value of the lira of about 17% against the US dollar in 2017, in 2018 we expect an average depreciation of about 15%. This pace of depreciation assumes a relatively benign political environment after the presidential and parliamentary elections, a mild shift by the authorities to a more conservative economic stance, and a gradual tightening of global and domestic monetary conditions. Shocks to any of these assumptions, such as the broad sell-off in emerging-market assets in April-May 2018 after a faster pick-up in nominal yields in the US, would lead to a more abrupt depreciation. In 2019-22 we expect the pace of depreciation to slow in nominal terms. This will result in a mild appreciation in real terms after six consecutive years of real effective depreciations.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
Owing to particularly large trade deficits at the end of 2017 and in early 2018, the weakness of the lira and rising commodity prices, we expect the current-account deficit to widen from 5.6% of GDP in 2017 to 6.5% of GDP this year (5.7% previously). However, moderating capital inflows will keep the lira weak and interest rates relatively high, contributing to a slowdown in import demand and a consequent narrowing of the current-account deficit during the forecast period. Turkey's substantial external financing needs will be difficult to meet if global liquidity is constrained and investor confidence deteriorates further. We expect the rebound in tourist arrivals in 2017 to continue, but they will remain vulnerable to a possible resurgence of terrorist attacks in the country.

Full text: United Kingdom--highlights: Political outlook
The minority Conservative government formed after the snap general election in June 2017 depends on the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist party (DUP) for survival. This arrangement should hold in the short term, because neither party wants another election-they are natural allies on questions of sovereignty and the EU, and the DUP is vociferously opposed to the Labour Party. However, the government's 13-seat working majority is likely to dwindle over time. Lacking a parliamentary majority and divided over Brexit, the government will do well to last until the UK's exit from the EU in 2019 and there is a risk of another pre-term election before 2022. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Conservative Party to see through the Brexit negotiations in 2018-21 before contemplating changing the party leadership and risking precipitating another early general election.

The UK's business environment score improves in 2018-22, lifting the country five places in our forward-looking global ranking and four places in our regional ranking. The Brexit vote in 2016 introduced uncertainty into aspects of the UK's policy framework, especially with regard to external trade and immigration. However, we do not think that Brexit poses a significant risk to the continued functioning of the country's banking system and financial markets. The UK's traditional strengths as a business location-such as a pro-business policy orientation, a welcoming attitude to foreign investment, and flexible labour and product markets-will endure. The Brexit shock has also forced policymakers to address some of the country's structural deficiencies, such as insufficient innovation and inadequate infrastructure, but the response so far has been insufficient.

The economy was resilient in the aftermath of the Brexit vote but has started to lose some momentum. Real GDP grew by 1.9% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017, and we expect it to slow to 1.5% on average in 2018-19. Rising cost pressures stemming from a weaker pound, combined with uncertainty about the Brexit negotiations and the UK's future relationship with the EU, are likely to constrain economic activity, particularly consumer and investment spending. Mitigating the deceleration in 2018 will be a slowing of the pace of import growth while export volumes continue to benefit from sterling's depreciation. This will allow the external balance to deliver a positive contribution to real GDP in 2018. After a transition period, a deal on the UK's new trading relationship with the EU is likely to take effect in 2021. We expect real GDP growth to quicken to 1.9% by 2022.

The UK population is forecast to grow at an annual average rate of 0.6% over the next five years, supported by "natural change" (an excess of births over deaths) and net immigration. Government efforts to reduce net immigration have proved ineffective; the UK's decision to leave the EU is unlikely to make a huge difference to levels of inward migration to the UK. An ageing population will ensure that pension-related spending accounts for a rising share of total public expenditure, adding to budgetary pressure on public services.

The UK will continue to offer the market opportunities of a rich, developed country. Consumers' spending power has been undermined by the sharp depreciation in the pound in 2016, which has reduced households' purchasing power, but this effect will fade gradually in the coming years. As a mature consumer market, underlying demand will be driven in part by a need to replace ageing stock, technological change and sociological factors, with population ageing underpinning healthcare and leisure spending.

Real GDP is forecast to grow by an annual average of 1.8% in 2018-30, accelerating to 1.9% in 2031-50 (1.4% and 1.5% in per head terms). The UK has a relatively high participation rate, so there is less scope for raising this than in many other EU countries, and demographics will make less of a contribution to growth. Long-term growth will depend increasingly on future productivity. Technological progress will be an important driver, but productivity levels will remain lower than in the US, Germany and France, reflecting a deficit in intermediate skills and infrastructure shortcomings.

Background: The end of the second world war coincided with the decline of the UK as an imperial power. Residual links with former colonial territories, close relations with the US and a separate sense of identity delayed UK membership of the European Community (now the EU) until 1973. Successive governments have resisted closer EU integration. In a referendum in June 2016 the UK electorate voted to leave the EU. The future contours of the UK's relationship with the EU are uncertain, but a diminution of UK influence in the region looks inevitable.
Political structure: The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II. Parliament has an elected House of Commons (the lower house, 650 seats) and a non-elected House of Lords (the upper house, non-fixed membership of about 800). The general election in June 2017 produced a minority centre-right Conservative Party government, dependent on the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) for a working majority. The main opposition Labour Party increased its parliamentary seats by 30 in the June 2017 snap general election, but its ability to compete with the Conservatives will be undermined when the government redraws parliamentary constituency boundaries, which are currently favourable to Labour.
Policy issues: UK economic policy has yet to return to normal after the financial crisis, with an exceptionally loose monetary stance. Real GDP growth slowed modestly in 2016-17 compared with 2015. The fallout from the Brexit vote will dominate the policy agenda; The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to focus efforts on negotiating the terms of its departure from the EU and on reducing the damaging effect on the economy of the uncertainty created by the vote. This has led to a shift in the UK's monetary and fiscal policy mix, with fiscal policies becoming more significant. Managing Brexit could force policymakers to address structural deficiencies in the UK, such as weak productivity.
Taxation: The headline rate of corporation tax has been steadily reduced, from 28% in 2010 to 19% since April 2018. There are three bands of personal income tax, set at 20%, 40% and 45% (the 45% rate came into effect in April 2013, replacing the 50% rate that was introduced in 2010). The standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 20% (raised from 17.5% in 2011). Excise duties on tobacco and alcohol are among the highest in Europe.
Foreign trade: In 2017 exports of goods totalled US$441.2bn and imports amounted to US$615.9bn, resulting in a trade deficit of US$174.7bn. The traditional services surplus fell to US$137.9bn. The overall current-account deficit narrowed in absolute terms, to US$106.4bn, from US$154.9bn in 2016, and fell sharply as a share of GDP, to 4.1%, from 5.8%.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
The UK is a parliamentary democracy. The legislature consists of an elected lower chamber, the House of Commons (650 seats), and an unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords (about 825 members), which was partly reformed in 1999. Pending a second stage of reform, most members of the House of Lords are appointed life peers. The UK is ruled by a minority government led by the centre-right Conservative Party under its leader, Theresa May, with the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist party (DUP). The Conservatives lost 13 seats in the snap election in June 2017, despite winning a higher percentage share of the vote compared with 2015, and had to negotiate a confidence and supply arrangement with the DUP, giving it a two-seat parliament majority. The Labour Party gained 30 seats in a swing of almost 10 percentage points from the 2015 election, giving it 262 seats. The snap poll in 2017 moved the next scheduled general election to May 2022. However, the government's minority status and the divisions within the Conservative Party over Brexit mean that there is a significant risk of another pre-term poll.

Political outlook: Political stability
Mrs May's decision to call an early general election in June 2017 backfired disastrously for the Conservative Party, which lost its majority. Mrs May has recently recouped some authority through her handling of a nerve agent attack on a former Russian military intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, in the UK on March 4th 2018. The prime minister blamed Russia, rallied the UK's international allies and expelled 23 Russian diplomats from the embassy in London. However, the positive political boost for the prime minister has proved to be short lived. The "Windrush" scandal-in which the children of the post-war generation of immigrants to the UK from the Caribbean were hounded by the authorities for official papers that many did not have, and threatened with deportation-unfolded in late April, prompting criticism of the "hostile environment" policy for immigrants pursued when Mrs May was home secretary in 2010-16. On April 30th Amber Rudd resigned as home secretary after she "inadvertently misled" a parliamentary committee about her knowledge of targets for the removal of immigrants who had arrived in the UK illegally.
The appointment of Sajid Javid (formerly the minister for housing, communities and local government) as Ms Rudd's replacement could help to ease political pressure on the government. Mr Javid is the first home secretary from an ethnic minority and is more liberal than the prime minister on immigration matters. However, the Windrush scandal and the circumstances of Ms Rudd's resignation have further weakened Mrs May's authority.
Mrs May will also continue to face difficulties in reconciling opposing factions in the cabinet that have different views about negotiating the UK's future relationship with the EU. Divisions in the cabinet and on the Conservative backbenches over Brexit are likely to persist. A number of Conservative rebels have declared their intention to try to force the government to reverse its position on remaining outside a customs union with the EU. However, doing so would probably trigger a revolt by pro-Brexit members of the government, leading to an early election. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Mrs May to stick to her commitment to leave the customs union and pursue an inde-pendent trade policy. As this will increase trade frictions and risks creating a hard border in Ireland, she is under pressure to present viable alternative customs arrangements.
Brexiteers in the cabinet have been supportive of Mrs May because they want her to hold fast to her pledges to leave the single market, the customs union and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). They will support the prime minister as long as she pursues their vision of Brexit. However, the customs union debate shows that Mrs May is also under pressure from those advocating a "softer" Brexit. These divisions have sharpened, presenting a threat to government stability in 2018.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
The next five years will be a period of significant political, institutional and constitutional change in the UK. The decision to leave the EU will not only transform the UK's relationship with the EU, but it also raises questions about the status of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland within the UK and the future devolution of powers within the UK.
The implications of Brexit for devolution-the transfer of powers from the central state to the Scottish parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the London Assembly, together with their related executive bodies-are not yet clear. Many areas that now fall under the competence of the devolved parliaments/assemblies are covered by EU law. After Brexit the devolved authorities will in theory be able to adopt their own laws and policies in these areas. This could result in growing legal divergence between different regions within the UK. The government has said that it will need to ensure consistency in the legal framework within the UK's internal market and will therefore retain control of some competencies for a limited period.
The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill will determine the degree to which the devolved authorities will be able to amend retained EU-derived laws that fall within their areas of competence. The UK government has proposed that the majority of the 158 devolved areas for which policy is decided in Brussels will be handed directly to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments. However, it wants to retain control temporarily of 24 areas, including agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement to ensure the observance of common rules and regulations across the UK internal market. This has met political opposition in Scotland, which objects that it would be prevented from passing laws in some of the devolved areas for up to seven years. On May 15th 2018 the Scottish parliament refused to give its consent to the bill.
It is possible that a compromise will be agreed, but ultimately the UK govern-ment can impose the legislation on Scotland, although this is politically undesirable and would overturn two decades (since the latest phase of devolution began in 1997) of constitutional convention and precedent. The devolved powers of the sub-national authorities reside with the national government, and the British state remains by law a unitary state. This means that the central government can take back control of certain competences, as it is minded to do for a time-limited period in certain areas after Brexit.
The government has previously ignored the will of the Scottish parliament, as in 2016, when Mrs May ruled out a second independence referendum for Scotland. At that time Scotland's first minister and leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), Nicola Sturgeon, received endorsement (69-59) from the Scottish parliament to request a Section 30 order from the UK government seeking permission to hold a second referendum. There is little evidence to suggest that support for independence has shifted much since the first independence referendum, in September 2014, when it was rejected by 55% to 45%. Also, the SNP lost 21 seats at the 2017 election, suggesting that there is little popular support for a second referendum and that the SNP's approval ratings are slipping. If there were another independence referendum by 2021, we would expect another vote to reject it.
The UK's decision to leave the EU, and the government's stated commitment to leaving the EU single market and customs union, has also raised questions about the status of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The border has become a focal point of negotiations between the EU and the UK, with the former demanding that the British government come up with concrete proposals for avoiding a "hard border" between the north and the south after Brexit. As at May 2018 the EU had rejected the two main proposals advanced by the British government. We expect that a solution will be found, but there is a significant risk that the Irish border issue will derail the negotiations.
Mrs May's government has abandoned plans for a revision of the boundaries of the UK's parliamentary districts, aimed at ensuring a more equitable distribution of seats according to population. These changes, which had been planned for after the June 2017 snap general election if the government had increased its majority, would have reduced the number of members of parliament (MPs) by 50 to 600, and probably provided the Conservatives with another 15-20 seats. After she lost her parliamentary majority Mrs may accepted that the govern-ment would not be able to get the legislation through the House of Commons (the lower house of parliament) in the face of opposition from the Labour Party, and the Liberal Democrats and smaller parties, given that the DUP is also opposed to the plan.
Political outlook: Election watch
A snap general election in June 2017 resulted in the Conservatives losing 13 seats, leaving them with 318 in the 650-seat House of Commons. The Labour Party won 30 seats in a swing of almost 10 percentage points from the 2015 election, giving it 262 seats. The DUP, which increased its share of parlia-mentary seats from eight to ten, became kingmaker.
The Conservatives formed a working government, based on a "confidence and supply" arrangement with Northern Ireland's DUP. This arrangement is likely to work in the short term, because neither party wants another election-they are natural allies on questions of sovereignty and the EU, and the DUP is committed to preventing the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, from coming to power given his past association with Northern Ireland's main nationalist party, Sinn Fein. However, the arrangement is politically fragile, and the govern-ment's 13-seat working majority (down from 17 seats before the election) will dwindle with each by-election.
The Conservatives and Labour remain almost neck and neck in recent opinion polls, on about 40-41%. The next general election is scheduled for May 2022. Lacking a parliamentary majority and divided over Brexit, the govern-ment will do well to last until then, and there is a risk of another pre-term election. We expect the Conservative Party to see through the Brexit negotiations in 2018-21 before it contemplates changing the party leadership and risks precipitating another early general election.
Political outlook: International relations
The UK will formally leave the single market at the end of the Article 50 process in March 2019. UK and EU negotiators have reached agreement on large parts of the draft withdrawal agreement that must be finalised by the autumn, such as citizens' rights, the financial settlement, Euratom and on most areas relating to separation provisions. There is also full agreement on the terms of the transition period, which will last for 21 months after the UK's formal withdrawal. During this period the UK will maintain access to the single market, but will be bound by the obligations of membership. The UK made several concessions that are unpalatable to Brexiteers: EU law will still be applicable; EU budget contri-butions will continue; the UK will have no say over fishing quotas; and there will be reciprocal free movement and subsequent entitlement to settled status until the end of the transition period. A win for the UK is that it will not be bound by the EU's trade policy, enabling it to negotiate and agree new trade deals during the transition.
There is a risk that the EU and the UK will clash on the Irish border issue, and that this will scupper the withdrawal agreement, but this is not our forecast. Mrs May must present an alternative customs arrangement that allows the UK to have an independent trade policy, minimises trade frictions and is acceptable to the Irish government. Proposals for a "customs partnership" and a "highly streamlined customs arrangement" have so far been met with scepticism. Trade flows with the EU should be facilitated by the close nature of the future trading relationship, which should involve some degree of regulatory alignment. However, Mrs May will need a more concrete viable alternative solution well before the UK-EU trade agreement is finalised.
Negotiations on trade will come with their own challenges, as competing interests among the member states will complicate the process. During trade talks the EU will resist attempts by the UK to cherry-pick from the benefits of membership, but the end result is likely to be a more comprehensive trade deal than that negotiated by the EU and Canada in 2016.
There are numerous obstacles to the successful conclusion of the negotiations, but we believe that compromises will make a deal possible, particularly given the economic incentive to maintain existing trade ties. Realistically, only the framework of a trade deal will be agreed by the time the UK withdraws in 2019, as completing the withdrawal agreement will take priority in 2018. However, transition arrangements will allow negotiations to continue, and we expect a deal to be in place by 2021.

The UK's score in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings rises from 7.63 in the historical period (2013-17) to 8.10 in the forecast period (2018-22). The country moves up five places in the global ranking to become the 14th most attractive business location in the world, and at a regional level the UK climbs four places to eighth among its 17 peers. The main drivers of this improvement are higher scores in the financing and taxes categories, which party reflect reforms following earlier damage caused by the global financial crisis. In the wake of the Brexit shock, policymakers have also made a more concerted effort to address some of the country's structural deficiencies, such as insufficient innovation. After a period of weaker economic activity and greater business caution-given the complexity of the Brexit process-we expect the UK's macroeconomic environment to improve gradually. Policymakers have devoted more resources to implementing structural reforms, and the UK will to retain many features of an attractive business location. However, the combination of a weak and divided government, a lack of consensus in the UK on an agreed form of Brexit, and uncertainty over the future policy and regulatory framework in areas such as immigration and crossborder trade imply a challenging period ahead for business.

Its traditional strengths will still make UK a favoured destination for FDI
The UK's traditional strengths as a business location have been a pro-business policy orientation, a low burden of regulation, a welcoming attitude to foreign investment, and flexible labour and product markets. The scores for the foreign trade regime and market opportunities fall, reflecting a likely deterioration in trading conditions with the UK's largest export partner (the EU). The business environment will be supported by fairly robust digital infrastructure and a well-developed innovation base, but underlying weaknesses, such as a complex tax regime, relatively poor transport infrastructure, weak productivity and a deficit in intermediate skills, will persist.

Business environment outlook: United Kingdom's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government retains large stake in struggling Royal Bank of Scotland. Brexit focus constrains reforms to improve weak trends in investment and productivity. Signs of rising public support for renationalisation in energy and rail industries.
2020-22: Shake-up of regulatory and competition frameworks post-Brexit. Continued state support underpins house prices.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Reduced foreign investor activity in financial and real estate sectors. Government "assurances" to attract inflows and encourage investment in largely foreign-owned automotive sector.
2020-22: Infrastructure plans offer investment opportunities. Likely changes in tax policies to bolster inward investment.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: UK formally leaves the EU, but likely transitional agreement to end-2020 implies that status quo arrangements largely continue. Tensions over Irish border. Talks begin on UK-EU free-trade agreement. Modest risk of no deal and hard Brexit.
2020-22: Expected decline in UK-EU crossborder trade. Some new UK-EU trading arrangement possibly phased in.
Taxes
2018-19: Gradual rise in personal income tax allowance, but also in total tax burden. Modest changes to business rates.
2020-22: Planned cut in corporation tax rate to 17%. Ongoing efforts to reduce revenue lost to growing tax avoidance and evasion. Possible changes to value-added tax (VAT) framework if UK leaves the EU's VAT regime after 2020.
Financing
2018-19: Monetary policy is tightened gradually but remains highly accommodative. "Ring-fencing" bank reforms and ongoing capital strengthening (ahead of 2019 deadlines). Steady growth in alternative forms of debt financing.
2020-22: Expected loss of "passporting" rights and restrictions on EU services trade. Modest decline in City of London status.
The labour market
2018-19: High employment persists but firms defer some hiring decisions amid Brexit uncertainty. Likely reduced inflows of EU workers. Phased increase in compulsory "national living wage", but whole-economy wage growth remains subdued.
2020-22: Some form of restrictions on free movement of labour from EU, but likely to be flexible in response to business concerns. Policymakers struggle to respond to weak productivity and deficit in intermediate skills.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Modest rise in spending on housing, roads and digital infrastructure. Crossrail service in London begins operation.
2020-22: Construction of high-speed rail link between London and the north of England. EU-funded investment falls.
Technological readiness
2018-19: UK performs well in terms of high e-commerce penetration and strong research base, but research and development (R&D) spending below EU average and limited provision of e-government services. Continued high threat from cyber-crime and cyber-espionage.
2020-22: Possible weakening of research and innovation framework owing to exit from-or more restricted access to-EU structural programmes (such as Horizon 2020) and project financing schemes. Modest rise in public R&D spending.

The macroeconomic environment for business has been underpinned in recent years by solid employment growth, resilient consumer demand, supportive financing conditions and a cyclical upturn in global growth (driven in part by major EU trading partners) that bolstered manufacturing and export activity in 2017. The depreciation in sterling since the Brexit referendum-in April 2018 the currency was 9% weaker in trade-weighted terms than two years' earlier-has provided a competitive boost to some firms, although its overall impact has been modest in historical terms.
In recent years the underlying trend in UK activity has been constrained by fiscal austerity, sluggish productivity, subdued investment spending (by both the government and the private sector) and an increase in Brexit-related uncertainty. However, the softening in activity also reflects a natural moderation in GDP growth after it accelerated to a post-crisis high of 3.1% in 2014. This partly accounts for the "decoupling" of UK output trends from the improved growth performance in other advanced peer economies since early 2017, and particularly in Europe, where the post-crisis recovery period began much later.
Economic activity will firm as Brexit-related uncertainty recedes
Nevertheless, we expect the UK's macroeconomic environment to improve during the forecast period. Demand in consumer-facing sectors has weakened owing to a deterioration in household purchasing power relating to sterling's weakness, but it is likely to be supported in the years ahead by high levels of employment and a gradual firming in real wage growth. The main driver of UK growth in recent decades has been household spending, and consumer confidence should improve as uncertainty recedes. Major capital spending plans by businesses may remain on hold until there is greater clarity over future trading arrangements, but we expect this to be temporary. The public finances have steadily improved, and financing conditions are favourable, implying some scope for fiscal support. Downside risks stem from high levels of consumer debt and a recent decline in household savings. The current account will continue to record a sizeable deficit, posing external financing risks.

The UK has long provided one of the world's most favourable environments for private enterprise, having pioneered the liberalisation of product markets and privatisation of state assets in the 1980s and early 1990s (in contrast to most other EU countries, where state monopolies have been deregulated only after the adoption of liberalising measures at EU level). Given this leading role in freeing up product markets, the UK has less scope for further advances than many countries. The regulatory burden faced by business is comparatively low, with the UK ranked seventh globally in the World Bank's Doing Business 2018 report. The number of procedures, time taken and costs involved to start a new business are all below the OECD average, and administrative processes involved in the payment of taxes, obtaining credit and utilities, resolving insolvency and the protection of minority investors are relatively modest. Competition policy has been strengthened by reforms and stands up to comparison with other high-income countries, although recent reviews of the banking, grocery and energy sectors have yielded limited reforms. With the exception of the National Health Service (NHS), state ownership in major sectors of the UK economy is fairly limited. The government retains a majority stake in the struggling Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), one of the "big four" commercial banks, has holdings in parts of the nuclear and rail industries, and has steadily become more involved in the UK's housing market through a series of debateable policy interventions in the post-crisis period.
Rising business uncertainty over future regulatory framework
The policy environment for private enterprise should remain broadly favourable, with comparatively low levels of regulation in product and labour markets. A post-Brexit transition period to end-2020 will offer some near-term clarity for businesses, although uncertainty over future immigration and cross-border trading arrangements will temporarily impinge on business planning. Brexit is likely to involve a restructuring of the UK's regulatory, competition and legislative frameworks, with implications for almost all sectors.

The UK has one of the world's most liberal environments for foreign investors. Since the 1980s successive governments have been favourably disposed towards foreign direct investment (FDI), reflecting a broad view across the political spectrum that the location of economic activity and corporate headquarters is more important than its nationality. Liberalised product markets, deep capital markets and London's status as the financial capital of Europe have facilitated foreign takeovers of many domestic firms, and governments have mostly been strikingly relaxed about such deals. Over recent years FDI inflows have been concentrated in finance, real estate, technology and knowledge-based services industries such as professional services and the creative sector.
Since the global crisis FDI inflows have been focused increasingly on London and the south-east, particularly in the financial and real estate sectors. However, both sectors face uncertainty related to Brexit, and inflows are likely to slow. Another trend has been an increasing share of FDI that reflects "corporate reconfiguration"-changes in complex multinational ownership structures-which has a minimal impact on output and employment in the host economy. This is likely to continue.
The short-term outlook for FDI inflows will be clouded by uncertainty over the UK's post-Brexit trading framework despite the government's promotion of an outward-looking "global Britain". In the near term we expect a steady pattern of FDI inflows, with activity supported by government "assurances" to existing large-scale foreign investors in sectors such as automotive and pharmaceuticals. The government also plans to reduce the corporation tax rate in stages to 17% in 2020, from 19% currently. However, should Brexit uncertainty persist, there is a risk that major disinvestments or project relocation will occur.

The UK's foreign trade regime is strongly defined by its membership of the EU, so the country's scheduled formal exit from the bloc in March 2019 implies a significant overhaul over the forecast period. The existing framework will remain in place until at least March 2019, with full freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and persons within the EU, no tariffs or quotas in the bloc, limited non-tariff EU trade restrictions and (outside agriculture) moderate customs duties relating to trade with non-EU countries, which is largely governed by multilateral agreements administered by the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
Trade agreement between EU and UK will take some years to negotiate
Beyond March 2019 there is still considerable uncertainty as to the likely form of trading arrangements. Both polarised outcomes of either "no Brexit' (implying no changes) or a "no-deal hard Brexit" (implying an immediate shift to WTO rules and disruption to UK trade) are unlikely, but each could occur. In our view the most probable sequencing of events is that the status quo arrangements largely remain in place for most of the forecast period while complex negotiations on a new EU-UK free trade agreement (FTA) continue. A transition period to end-2020 has been provisionally approved, implying continued single-market access and customs union membership for 21 months after the UK's formal exit, although final agreement on this remains contingent on all other outstanding issues related to the UK's withdrawal also being settled by late 2017, which is not guaranteed given continued tensions and disagree-ments relating to the Irish border. Assuming that a workaround on this issue can be found, it is quite possible that the transitional period could subsequently be extended beyond its current end-2020 deadline, both because of the scale of work involved in trying to facilitate a new EU-UK FTA, and also because a new customs/border arrangements may not be in place by the end of the transition period.
The government has repeatedly stated that the UK will leave the single market and the customs union (which allows goods to move freely without customs checks), so that it can negotiate trade deals with countries outside the EU. Remaining within the customs union would give the UK tariff-free access to EU markets, but would mean adopting a common external tariff and accepting mutual recognition of some EU-wide regulations, without having a vote on them. The government insists that it will leave the EU customs union, but as of May 2018 it remained undecided over its approach to future customs arrangements.
The government will pursue an FTA to try to minimise costly non-tariff barriers (technical regulations, compliance requirements, "rules of origin" documentation) that will be imposed outside the bloc. There are numerous obstacles to the successful conclusion of negotiations, but we believe that compromises will make a deal possible, particularly given the economic incentive to maintain existing trade ties. During trade talks the EU will resist attempts by the UK to cherry-pick from the benefits of membership, but the end result is likely to be a more comprehensive trade deal than that negotiated by the EU and Canada in 2016.

The tax regime has a number of attractive features from a business perspective. The overall tax burden has remained fairly stable and below the EU average over the past decade-the UK's tax/GDP ratio was 35% in 2016 (latest comparable Eurostat data), well below an EU average of 40%-taxation of labour income is competitive, and the headline corporate tax rate is comparatively low (following a series of cuts since 2008). However, there are also some less appealing aspects. The steady trend in the overall tax take has masked significant structural changes in the composition of revenue, driven by recent governments' strong appetite for manipulating tax rates to influence short-term behaviour. This has made the tax system more onerous and complex, and the absence of a coherent medium-term tax strategy implies some uncertainty for households and businesses. In addition, marginal tax rates on corporate investment are high (owing to elevated business property taxes and a limited capital allowance regime), the system of residential property taxation is regressive and outdated, and tax avoidance among the wealthy is widespread. In terms of the structure of tax receipts, the share of revenue from personal income, property and indirect taxes (such as value-added tax-VAT) is above the EU/OECD average, and a lower share is derived from corporate income and social security contributions.
The headline corporation tax rate will be reduced to 17% by 2020
The UK has a competitive regime for taxation of labour income, with one of the lowest tax wedges in the EU. The tax burden on households has risen over the past decade, in response to various "stealth" taxes (such as on travel and insurance) and because of "fiscal drag"-taxpayers pushed into higher tax brackets as thresholds failed to keep pace with inflation-although reforms in recent years have partly reversed the fiscal-drag effect. The standard VAT rate is 20%-slightly above the OECD average. Reduced rates apply to a comparatively wide range of goods and services. Excise duties on fuel, tobacco and alcohol are among the highest in Europe. The headline corporation tax rate has been lowered by successive governments, from 30% in 2007 to 19% as at April 2018. Under current government plans it is scheduled to fall to 17% in 2020.
There is limited room for manoeuvre for major tax reform, given the state of the public finances, the uncertain economic outlook and the Conservative government's 2015 election pledge not to raise in-come tax, National Insurance contributions (NICs) or VAT until 2020. Recent budgets have been modest in scope, incorporating various "stealth" reforms to push the overall tax burden marginally higher. The changing composition of the labour market, reduced revenue streams from financial services and North Sea oil, and continued aggressive tax-planning practices by most large multinational firms to reduce their tax liabilities imply that the tax burden will increase gradually over the forecast period.
The government's occasional pitch to transform the UK into a "Singapore-style" low-tax, low-regulation economy in the event of a poor Brexit deal lacks credibility. The Singapore model is reliant on high immigration, state intervention and a minimal social safety net, which are unlikely to appeal to a majority of UK voters. The EU may demand assurances in Brexit negotiations over future UK tax policies in an effort to protect the bloc against fiscal dumping. Changes are likely to the UK's VAT framework after 2020, assuming the UK opts to leave the EU's VAT regime. These could affect domestic tax rates for consumers and also have implications for crossborder trading arrangements.

The UK financial sector was a notable casualty of the global market turmoil a decade ago, but steady progress has since been made to repair the damage. The underlying resilience of the banking sector has improved, as institutions have raised their capital and liquidity buffers amid tighter regulation and major restructuring. The rescued RBS remains in a weak state, but on aggregate the Tier 1 capital ratio of the banking sector compares favourably with other high-income countries and non-performing loan ratios are among the lowest in the EU. Annual Bank of England (BoE, the central bank) stress tests against severe economic scenarios imply that the sector is reasonably well placed to withstand financial shocks, with the stock of high-quality liquid assets held by major UK banks around four times the level before the global crisis. Previously lax domestic supervisory and regulatory frameworks have been tightened, with more robust capital and liquidity provisioning, implementation of bank "ring-fencing" reforms and measures to reduce mortgage risk in the UK's highly leveraged housing market (such as tighter underwriting standards for owner-occupier mortgages). In its recent Financial Stability Report the BoE judged that domestic financial risks-excluding those related to Brexit-were at a "standard level", although it noted that current low debt-financing costs could obscure underlying strains, particularly in the consumer credit market and commercial property sector. A large external financing requirement implies that the UK will remain vulnerable to a reduction in foreign investor appetite.
Restrictions on UK-EU financial services trade are likely to emerge
Brexit implies considerable uncertainty for the UK financial services sector. The City of London is deeply integrated in global-particularly EU-financial markets, and although it will retain its status as one of the world's leading financial centres, some post-Brexit restrictions on financial services trade with the EU are inevitable, as is a gradual decline of the sector's influence at a global level. The loss of "passporting" (the right for UK-regulated financial companies to do business in the EU) and a decline in the UK's current dominance of the euro clearing market are the most likely consequences. The levels of future EU market access for UK financial firms will be dependent on an agreement on "mutual recognition and regulatory equivalence", elements of which are contentious. There has been no major exodus of financial sector jobs and operations from the UK, but we expect a gradual and steady net outflow to financial centres within the euro zone and to major rivals such as New York and Singapore.
The credit cycle has firmed over recent years, supported by the low interest rate environment, although total private-sector lending growth has remained quite modest, averaging about 4% in 2016 and 2017 (compared with double-digit growth in the pre-crisis period). This reflects subdued activity in the large market for mortgage lending, whereas the smaller stock of unsecured consumer credit has expanded sharply. This carries potential risks given the underlying weakness of household finances, although growth has eased moderately since mid-2017. Bank lending to corporates contracted for seven successive years to 2015 and will remain weak. There has been an increase in alternative forms of debt financing (peer-to-peer, crowdfunding), which will continue.

Labour market conditions will remain favourable
The UK labour market is among the most flexible in the world, with a decentralised system of wage bargaining and fairly liberal laws on redundancy. In recent years this has facilitated solid employment growth and a steady decline in joblessness. Headline indicators in early 2018 continued to impress-an employment rate of 75.4% was the highest since comparable records began in 1971, and an unemployment rate of 4.2% was the lowest since 1975. Participation of female and older workers has increased in response to ongoing pension reforms. However, these positive developments have been accompanied by some less attractive features of the labour market: a protracted period of flat or declining real wages; weak productivity growth; and a rising share of "less secure" employment (agency jobs and temporary or "zero-hours" contracts), mostly in low-wage, low-skill occupations that point to the gradual emergence in some areas of a two-tier "insider-outsider" labour market that is more traditionally associated with continental European economies such as France and the Netherlands. Average real-term weekly earnings are not expected to recover to pre-crisis levels until at least 2025 (this would imply a 17-year period of stagnant wages, which is unprecedented in modern times). The UK's productivity performance since 2008 has been poor, with growth in output per hour and output per worker considerably weaker than its long-term pre-crisis trend, and slower than in almost all peer economies.
Under the Labour government of 1997-2010 the UK moved closer to the "social model" prevailing in much of continental Europe by signing the EU's social chapter, introducing a minimum wage and strengthening temporary workers' rights. There was also a marked increase in labour immigration from within and outside the EU. A steady net inflow of foreign labour has since continued, amid demand from firms seeking to fill skilled positions and minimise their overall wage costs. As in many countries, public sentiment in the UK towards immigration has hardened, alongside mostly ineffectual government targets to reduce the inflow of foreign workers. The issue of immigration played a significant role in the Brexit referendum, with the decision to withdraw from the EU viewed by many "Leave" voters as a means to allow the government to "take back control" of the UK's borders, although there is little agreement on what form this may take in practice.
Free movement of labour from the EU will continue for a limited time
The post-Brexit transition period up to end-2020 would imply that the free movement of labour would continue for a time after the UK's formal exit at end-March 2019. The form of any future UK-EU relationship after 2020 remains highly uncertain. Barring a "no deal" scenario, business lobbying for access to foreign labour is likely to mean that any final agreement on immigration will be fairly flexible, albeit while still allowing the government to claim that it has greater control. Some restrictions on EU workers' labour-market access and rights in the UK are likely to be implemented, but may not materialise until after the forecast period.
Official data and anecdotal evidence suggest that inflows of EU workers have fallen since the Brexit referendum. Given the weaker outlook for the economy and more strident nationalistic sentiment in the UK, this trend is likely to continue, raising the prospect of recruitment difficulties in sectors that are more reliant on foreign labour, such as retail, hospitality and healthcare.
Recent reforms include the introduction in April 2017 of a new apprenticeship levy (equivalent to 0.5% of employment costs, paid by all firms with a wage bill above £3m-US$3.8m) and a phased increase up to 2020 in the compulsory "national living wage" for workers over the age of 25. In April 2018 business groups called for major reforms to be made to the apprenticeship levy, amid widespread criticism of its design.

A long-term infrastructure investment strategy is overdue
The quality of UK network infrastructure is modest by developed-country standards, and only limited improvements are expected. Standards are by no means uniform. The main shortcomings are highly congested road and urban rail networks, airport capacity constraints in southern England, limited (and costly) new energy-generation capacity and a distorted housing market suffering from chronic undersupply. By contrast, the UK is among the region's better-performing countries in terms of digital connectivity, and is one of the world's largest e-commerce markets. Mobile network coverage and provision of high-speed broadband services are above the regional average, although broadband costs are relatively high. Liberalised utility markets are dominated by former regional monopolies, with energy costs around the EU average.
The UK has long suffered from low levels of public infrastructure investment. Current policy plans imply a modest rise in state-backed infrastructure spending on housing, roads and innovation, albeit from a low base and with the prospect of accompanying falls in EU-funded structural investment. Private-sector involvement will remain low. Since 2015 a new National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) has been tasked with planning infrastructure priorities over a 30-year horizon-a welcome step towards establishing a coherent investment strategy, which had been ignored by successive governments. However, delivery of major projects will continue to be hampered by a complex planning framework, high land prices, vested interests and funding issues. Total infrastructure investment will remain below the OECD average.
Attracting new private investment in electricity generation will require consumer-funded price guarantees from the government, similar to a contentious 2016 deal signed with EDF, a French energy group, to build the first nuclear-power plant in the UK for a generation. Construction is to be completed by the mid-2020s.
Airport capacity constraints will remain severe
Airport infrastructure is well developed, but capacity constraints are particularly severe in and around London. After years of delay, in October 2016 the government provisionally approved a third runway at Heathrow-the world's busiest two-runway airport. Major doubts persist over the project, however, amid strong local opposition, environmental concerns and legal threats. No increase in capacity is expected over the forecast period.
A number of rail projects are progressing, most notably a 118-km east-west rail link under central London (Crossrail), due to begin services from late 2018. A high-speed rail network (HS2) from London to major northern cities received parliamentary approval in 2017. A decade-long construction programme will begin this year, amid widespread local opposition and spiralling cost projections.

This category aims to show the extent to which the business environment is open to innovation, digitally connected and prepared for technological disruption. The UK scores reasonably well on a regional and global basis, mainly owing to the scope and quality of its existing digital infrastructure; extensive e-commerce and e-business penetration, above-average digital skill levels, and a well-developed framework of research and innovation infrastructure arising from its strong scientific and university base. Weaker aspects are a comparatively low level of research and development (R&D) spending (across the public and private sectors), modest linkages between the science and business sectors, and fairly limited provision of e-government services. Whereas the UK ranked among seven "innovation leaders" in the European Innovation Scoreboard 2017-scoring particularly well in terms of its research structure and workforce skills-R&D intensity has remained broadly flat over the past decade, with total spending of 1.7% of GDP in 2016 below the EU average of 2% and far behind the highest ratios of more than 3% in Sweden and Austria (as well as Switzerland, South Korea and Japan). There is also significant regional disparity in R&D expenditure across the UK. Recent studies suggest that the proportion of UK companies using industrial robotics in the manufacturing sector or deploying emerging digital technologies (such as augmented reality or artificial intelligence) is among the lowest in the OECD. A National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) was established in October 2016 to combat the increasing threat from cyber-crime. Part of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) intelligence service, the NCSC was formed by integrating three separate cyber-related agencies. According to its annual report, an estimated 40% of UK businesses suffered at least one cyber-related attack in 2017. Recent events have underlined the threats posed to national sovereignty, business interests and personal privacy from the targeted activities of state-backed organisations (in April 2018 the NCSC identified Russia as the UK's "most capable hostile adversary in cyberspace"), cyber criminals and the dominant global technology companies.
The UK will retain a strong scientific and university base, and the government has pledged to increase levels of public R&D investment. However, there is a risk that overall funding for research and innovation will be squeezed by ongoing austerity and the UK's likely exit from-or more restricted access to-EU structural programmes (such as Horizon 2020) and project financing schemes later in the forecast period.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
The UK's departure from the EU may encourage policymakers to address some of the structural deficiencies that have held back the economy in recent years, including lacklustre productivity growth, insufficient innovation and poor infra-structure. The chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, announced a National Productivity Investment Fund to boost the UK's digital infrastructure and spending on research and develop-ment over the next five years. Proposals to reform the UK's housing market have focused on introducing greater speed and flexibility into the planning process. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects these measures to support the recovery in productivity, but they are too modest in scope to close the UK's productivity gap with its G7 peers.

The Queen's Speech in June 2017 set out the government's legislative agenda, which was dominated by Brexit. Eight of the 27 bills relate to the transfer of EU law into British law, a UK customs regime, independent trade policy, controls on immigration, fisheries policy, agricultural policy, nuclear safeguards and the UK's ability to impose international sanctions. In a further sign that Brexit is the government's priority, the parliamentary session will last for two years rather than one, ending two months after the UK's withdrawal at end-March 2019.
The centrepiece of the autumn budget in November 2017 was a sizeable increase in spending on the National Health Service (NHS). In March 2018 Mrs May said that the government would this year draw up a "long-term funding plan" to secure the future of the NHS.

Government debt 87.7 88.0 86.3 83.6 81.3 81.0
Data suggest that the government has already met its "fiscal mandate" of a structural deficit smaller than 2% of GDP by fiscal year 2020/21. The budget deficit narrowed sharply in 2017, to 1.9%, from 3% in 2016 of GDP, owing to strong growth in tax revenue. This implies some scope for higher public spending in the autumn budget statement. However, in the remainder of our forecast period (2018-22) we expect the government to continue to aim to nudge down discretionary spending as a proportion of GDP. We expect the deficit to contract to 1.6% of GDP by 2020 and 1% by 2022. We forecast that public debt will decline from 88% in 2018, to reach 81% by 2022.

At its meeting in March 2018 the monetary policy committee (MPC) of the Bank of England (BoE, the central bank) voted to keep the main policy interest rate unchanged at 0.5%, five months after raising it by 25 basis points for the first time in a decade. Seven members of the nine-strong committee supported this position, with two members voting to increase the policy rate by 25 basis points to 0.75%. The MPC is keen to begin normalising its policy rate, although recent soft economic data are likely to mean that the BoE will delay its next rate rise until August 2018. We expect a gradual tightening cycle to follow, with a series of 25-basis-point increases in the policy rate over the next five years, taking it to 2.25% by end-2022.

The economy has been resilient in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Average annual real GDP growth was firm in 2016 and 2017, at 1.9% and 1.8% respectively. However, the annual pace of growth slowed throughout 2017, from 2.1% in January-March to 1.4% in October-December, and preliminary data show a further slowdown in the first three months of 2018, to 1.2%. In response to these weak first-quarter data, we have revised down slightly our forecast for full-year real GDP growth in 2018, from 1.5% to 1.4%. We expect real GDP growth to remain broadly stable in 2019, at 1.5%.

We expect the modest slowdown in 2018-19 to be led by a deceleration in domestic demand. A looser fiscal stance will provide some support to real GDP growth throughout the forecast period, but consumer spending will weaken in response to the continued squeeze on household disposable incomes from falling real wages. Consumer spending was fairly resilient to this pressure in 2017, reflecting employment gains, high levels of household borrowing and a decline in the savings ratio. In 2018 we expect employment growth to slow and greater uncertainty about the economic outlook to push up precautionary savings. Consumer spending will recover in 2019-22 as inflation eases, uncertainty recedes and unemployment edges lower. However, increased borrowing costs arising from tighter monetary policy will hold back the pace of the recovery in these years. We forecast that investment spending will decelerate in 2018-19 as a result of heightened uncertainty during difficult Brexit trade negotiations and higher cost pressures as a result of sterling's depreciation, before recovering in 2020-22 as these effects fade.
Mitigating the extent of the domestically driven slowdown in 2018 will be a positive contribution to GDP growth from the external balance as export volumes benefit from a competitiveness boost as a result of sterling's depreciation, while the weaker domestic demand environment reduces import growth. From 2019 we expect the trade balance to exert a drag on GDP growth owing to our forecast for a recovery in domestic demand, which will push up import growth again. Our expectation of a business cycle downturn in the US in 2020 and a deal on the UK's new trading relationship with the EU, which should take effect in 2021 and result in looser trade ties than before, will also constrain exports in 2020-22. We expect real GDP growth to pick up to 1.8% on average in those years.
Trade policy is the biggest risk to our forecast for economic growth globally. In March the US announced new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports; a number of countries, including the EU, received an exemption, which was rolled over at the beginning of May. This expires on June 1st, and there is a risk that if the US lets it expire and applies tariffs to EU exports, the bloc will retaliate with tariffs of its own, leading to a broader trade conflict.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
The UK's decision to leave the EU may over time have a significant influence on the sectoral profile of the economy, although the precise outcome will depend on the details of the Brexit deal that is reached between the UK and the other 27 EU member states. One industry facing considerable uncertainty is the UK's large financial services sector. London is currently unrivalled as the EU's leading centre for financial services activity, but this position would be called into question if firms based there lost their current "passporting" rights to operate across the EU. London, unlike New York, does not enjoy a domestic financial hinterland. Although domestic financial markets are highly developed, their size is limited by the UK's economic output of £2trn (US$2.6trn, about 3.3% of world GDP) and a population of 66m (about 1% of the global total). Instead, London and other centres of financial business in the UK have turned to international, and especially European, activities. The industry has managed to dominate sophisticated, high-value activities such as trading foreign exchange and financial derivatives, managing alternative assets or writing crossborder insurance contracts.
UK financial services will thrive after Brexit
Our baseline forecast assumes that the UK's financial services sector will retain its pre-eminence in Europe after Brexit. The advantage enjoyed by the City of London (and Canary Wharf) is overwhelming compared with every other European city and anywhere in the world with the exception of New York. This advantage derives from its unrivalled supportive infrastructure in terms of law, culture, language, tax system, sectoral expertise and regulatory environment. The factors that have made the UK a world leader in financial services are not contingent on its membership of the EU.

Nevertheless, leaving the EU is likely to hit services activity more sharply than manufacturing-because reaching agreement on goods trade tends to be much simpler than doing so on services trade-and this is particularly salient for the UK given how dominant the services sector is. It has grown in importance over a period of decades and now accounts for just less than 80% of UK value added-a comparatively high share among developed economies, although slightly below that of France and Belgium. In contrast, the UK's industrial base has contracted steadily as a share of total output, although for all the talk of decline the country is still among the world's ten largest manufacturers. Industry (including construction) accounts for 20% of GDP, and manufacturing comprises around half of this industrial total. The main sectors have shown differing trends since the economic downturn in 2007-08. Output in manufacturing has increased sluggishly, and is still slightly below its pre-crisis peak (0.8%). Output in construction expanded rapidly since 2013 and, despite a downturn in early 2018, remains 6% above its pre-crisis peak. By contrast, services output has expanded steadily in the decade since 2008, to almost 15% above its pre-crisis peak.

The construction sector currently accounts for about 6% of GDP. Despite the UK experiencing one of the world's most sustained increases in house prices in the period up to 2008, the construction sector did not expand anywhere near as strongly as in Spain, the US or Ireland. The stringency of planning regulations and vested interests in supporting solid house price inflation has held back the construction of new homes in recent decades, especially in and around London. To keep up with robust population growth, the government has introduced polices aimed at unlocking supply, and in 2017 committed to delivering the biggest annual increase in house-building since the 1970s. However other aspects of the government's housing policy remain supportive of prices. Growth in house-building has nevertheless become a bright spot in an otherwise struggling construction sector. New orders for commercial work and infrastructure projects slowed in 2017 and were hit further by the collapse in early 2018 of Carillion, the UK's second-largest construction and outsourcing firm. Only modest growth is expected across the construction sector over the forecast period.
As in other developed economies, the manufacturing sector has accounted for a falling share of UK GDP. This partly reflects the fact that households spend a growing share of their income on services as their wealth increases. However, the decline has been more pronounced than in almost every other industrial-ised country. The deep recession of the early 1980s dealt a permanent blow to the country's industrial heartlands, but it is notable that the declining importance of manufacturing has been more pronounced since the late 1990s-the sector accounted for almost 27% of output in 1997. The persistent strength of sterling for much of the period between the mid-1990s and 2006-07 weakened the competitiveness of export-oriented manufacturers, at the same time as labour-intensive industries were unable to compete with the rise in imports from expanding emerging economies with lower wage costs. Industrial investment declined further from already comparatively low levels. Against this backdrop, and with policymakers focusing their attention on and collecting revenue from the financial and business services sectors, we expect services and manufacturing to maintain their respective shares of output over the forecast period.

The headline rate of annual inflation-as measured by the consumer price index including owner occupiers' housing costs (CPIH)-accelerated to 2.6% on average in 2017, up from 1% in 2016. The increase partially reflects a rebound in oil prices, but has been amplified by the sharp depreciation of sterling since the Brexit vote. The pound has since reversed much of this appreciation, but we expect it to weaken again in 2018-20, and oil prices are likely to rise further this year. As retailers continue to pass on high input costs to customers, we expect inflation to remain above the BoE's official 2% target for much of 2018, averaging 2.4%, even as domestic price pressure weakens. Tighter monetary will bring inflation back towards the bank's target from 2019; we forecast that inflation will ease to 1.9% next year and 2.1% on average in 2020-22.

There was a sharp drop in the external value of sterling after the Brexit vote. Sensitivity in the foreign-exchange markets to the Brexit news flow has contributed to volatility in the value of the pound, which lost further value against both the euro and the US dollar in 2017, although it appreciated sharply against the dollar in early 2018. The pound has been fairly resilient since mid-2017, and we expect it to remain broadly flat against the euro in 2018-19, at about EUR1.15:£1 on average (which compares with EUR1.22:£1 in 2016), before weakening more sharply in 2020-partly reflecting the difficulty in completing Brexit negotiations, but also tighter monetary policy in the euro zone. We then expect it to recover modestly against the euro in 2021-22, as a new UK-EU trade relationship is established. Meanwhile the pound has recently lost value against the dollar, but remains at a stronger level than in 2017; we expect it to average US$1.39:£1 in 2018, before weakening slightly in 2019-20 and recovering some value in 2021-22.

The merchandise trade balance will keep the current account in deficit throughout 2018-22, offsetting surpluses on the services account. The current-account deficit narrowed to 4.1% of GDP in 2017, from 5.8% in 2016. We forecast that it will narrow further in 2018, to 3.8% on average, as slower growth in imports due to softer domestic demand reduces the deficit on the goods account and supports a larger services surplus. In 2019-20 we expect the current-account deficit to widen to 4.5% on average as domestic demand recovers. From 2021 we expect looser trade relations with the EU to mean a wider goods trade deficit and smaller services surplus, although this will be offset by a reduction in secondary transfers as the UK reduces its contribution to the EU budget. We forecast a current-account deficit of 4.6%of GDP per year in 2021-22.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in United Kingdom
Stocks and flows
Since the early 1990s the UK has been one of the top recipients of foreign direct investment (FDI) among the world's advanced economies and the biggest recipient of FDI in the EU. In 2017 the UK held the fourth-largest stock of global FDI, around half of which was from other EU countries, according to figures from the OECD. The book value of the stock of FDI in the UK totalled US$2trn at the end of 2017, equivalent to 79.1% of GDP. Relative to GDP, the UK's inward FDI stock is the highest in the G7 group of industrialised countries, although it is well below that of several medium-sized European economies such as Ireland, the Netherlands and Sweden.
Following the slump in global mergers and acquisitions (M&A) at the beginning of the 2000s, annual FDI inflows into the UK rose strongly in 2005-08, peaking at US$253bn. During this period the number and scale of FDI projects into the UK-mostly in the form of M&A-confirmed the country's status as one of the world's top recipients of FDI. The global financial crisis and severe economic recession resulted in a marked slowdown in inflows, as access to all forms of financing was restricted. Since 2010 the trend in FDI inflows has been steady rather than spectacular, averaging an annual US$53bn in 2010-15, but in 2016 inward investment surged to US$265.8bn, largely as a result of the foreign acquisition of two major UK companies: SABMiller, a multinational beverage producer; and ARM Holdings, a technology firm. In 2017 FDI inflows fell back to US$46.6bn.
Origin and distribution
US companies have long been the largest inward direct investors in the UK, although taken together the EU28 account for the largest share of the total inward FDI stock. As at the end of 2016 (latest data) the US accounted for 34.4% of the UK inward direct investment stock. As a region the EU accounted for a cumulative 42.6% of the inward FDI stock at the end of 2016. The share of Asian countries (primarily Japan) has been fairly stable over recent years, at just below 8%. Financial services, electronics and automotives have traditionally accounted for a large share of inward FDI into the UK and remain important sectors, but the composition is steadily changing, with the UK attracting greater investment in areas such as business services, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, information technology, software development and energy generation.
Determinants
The UK's attractiveness as a location for FDI over the past 20 years has rested on a policy of openness to foreign investors, a strikingly relaxed attitude to foreign takeovers of domestic companies, liberalised product markets, a flexible labour market (by European standards in particular), deep and liquid capital markets, external economies of scale in sectors such as financial services (where London's position as a financial centre has developed and fed on a large pool of qualified banking, legal and other business services staff) and membership of the EU (which gives firms located in the UK access to the world's largest trading bloc). There is some risk that the UK's withdrawal from the EU will undermine this attractiveness, although its status as a magnet for FDI has hinged on factors other than its EU membership. A less tangible but still important magnet has been the status of English as the world's leading business language. A steady reduction in the headline rate of corporation tax has been a policy priority of the Conservative Party over recent years, designed to encourage multinational companies to be based and invest in the UK (although the success of this approach is far from conclusive).
Impact
FDI has had a positive effect on the economy, even if studies suggest that this is sometimes exaggerated. Inward direct investors employ about 2m workers in the UK, and many of the country's most productive business units, such as the Nissan and Toyota car plants, are foreign-owned. Evidence for broader spillover effects is more mixed. Although foreign companies are often held to improve working practices and quality standards in local companies, empirical evidence suggests that positive spillover effects-if they occur at all-are geographically concentrated, partly because of low levels of labour mobility.
Potential
In the long term the UK should continue to be a broadly attractive location for FDI, although an economic slowdown in 2018-19 and uncertainty about the country's future relationship with the EU may deter some investors, especially from EU countries, in the short term. Some investors will also remain wary of the UK's persistent macroeconomic imbalances (a still large fiscal deficit, a substantial current-account deficit and high levels of private-sector debt), as well as vulnerabilities in the banking sector. A major weakness of the UK business environment will remain the congestion and unreliability of its land transport infrastructure, with no major improvements expected on this front over the next five years. Nevertheless, existing clusters and economies of scale in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, financial services, bio-technology and software development will remain powerful magnets for foreign entrants, and significant potential exists for large-scale, long-term investments in the energy and transport sectors.

Net international migration will be the main driver of steady population growth
The UK population totalled an estimated 66.2m in 2017, up from 59m in 2000 and 57m in 1990. During the 1990s population growth averaged 0.3% per year. It has accelerated over the past decade, with growth averaging 0.67% per year in 2013-17. Up until the mid-1990s the rise in the population was primarily driven by "natural change" (that is, more births than deaths). This remains a significant factor, but over the past two decades the primary driver has been net inter-national migration into the UK. According to the latest official estimates, net migration totalled 244,000 in the year ending September 2017, which was at a similar level to 2014, and followed record levels of net migration in 2015 and 2016. Net migration remains well above the government's target of less than 100,000.
The UK's decision to leave the EU is likely to have an impact on the rate of inward migration to the UK over time, but the probable effect should not be overstated, not least because there may simply be a shift in the balance of migration to the UK in favour of non-EU citizens at the expense of EU citizens. In the year to end-September 2017, 220,000 EU citizens (down by 47,000, or 17.6% year on year) and 285,000 non-EU citizens (up by 26,000, or 10% year on year) came to the UK. Of the 334,000 people who left the country over the same period (a year-on-year increase of 9,000), 125,000 were UK citizens, 130,000 were EU citizens and 80,000 were non-EU citizens.
Whatever UK-EU deal is agreed in the years ahead is likely to involve restrictions on migration to the UK from the other EU member states, perhaps in return for some restrictions on UK services trade with the bloc. It is too early to gauge the precise outline of such a compromise, but it may involve something like an emergency brake on migration over a certain threshold rather than a swingeing reduction in the number of arrivals, which would cause considerable strain in many sectors of the economy. The impact of the Brexit referendum on UK demographics therefore might not be huge.
Over the past decade population growth was faster in England than in the other constituent nations of the UK, lifting its share of the total to an estimated 84.2% in 2016 (compared with 8.2% for Scotland, 4.7% for Wales and 2.9% for Northern Ireland). The strongest growth has been in London-the destination of more than a third of international migrants in recent years-followed by the east and south-east regions of England. These trends will continue, providing a steady stream of labour in and around the capital, but also placing more pressure on already overstretched transport infrastructure and housing supply.
An ageing population will add to fiscal pressures over the forecast period
Births are continuing to outnumber deaths. The number of live births has fluctuated in recent decades but has stabilised since the 1960s baby boom and has generally been between 700,000-800,000 since the 1970s. Births peaked recently at 813,000 in 2012, the highest since 1990. The long-term trend in the death rate has been more stable than the birth rate, and the number of deaths declined steadily until 2011, as people are living longer. More recently deaths began to rise slightly, until 2016, when they decreased to 597,000.
Natural increase is one factor accounting for population growth in the UK, but as discussed above, net migration has been the main driver since the mid-1990s. The direct effect of net migration has increased the population by more than 250,000 people on average per year in 2004-2016; this is an average of about 52,000 more people per year than the natural change for the same period.
As in most developed economies, the UK population is ageing-albeit not quite as rapidly as in some EU countries-as the mortality rate declines (particularly among males). This implies that pension-related spending (the largest single component of UK public-sector expenditure) will continue to account for a rising share of total public spending, adding to budgetary pressure on all public services, including healthcare, given the current government's policy inclination towards fiscal consolidation. Since the mid-1970s the median age of the UK population (the age at which half of the population is younger and half is older) has risen from 34 years to 40 years. In 2016 there were 285 people aged 65 and over for every 1,000 people aged 16 to 64 years. The share of the population aged 65 or over is projected to rise steadily, to 19.4% in 2022, from 17.2% in 2012. The share of the working-age population peaked in 2008-09 and will continue to fall gradually over the forecast period.

The market opportunities available to businesses operating in the UK will partly depend on the country's future relations with the EU. At present the UK's membership of the EU means that the effective size of the domestic market is not the UK population of 66m but the EU population of 507m. Following the Brexit decision at least some businesses-probably in the services sector-are likely, over time, to find themselves either shut out of the EU market or facing increased costs and regulatory requirements to trade there. In addition, the process of exiting the EU may be disruptive in the short term.
Notwithstanding these challenges in the short and medium term, outside the EU the UK's large, rich and flexible economy will continue to provide opportunities for inward investors and global exporters. With nominal GDP of US$2.63trn (at market exchange rates) in 2017, the UK is the fifth-largest economy in the world (after the US, China, Japan and Germany). GDP per head at market exchange rates was US$39,691 in 2017, ranking the UK in 11th position within the EU28, sandwiched between France and Italy. On The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecasts, GDP per head at market exchange rates will rise over the forecast period (2018-22).
Brexit uncertainty will weigh on consumer spending in 2018-19
When assessing relative output, however, it can be more informative to make these comparisons using purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion rates rather than market exchange rates. PPP explicitly adjusts for differences in price levels between countries that are not always captured by market exchange rates. On the PPP measure, nominal GDP totalled US$2.9trn in 2017, ranking the UK as the ninth-largest world economy (after China, the US, India, Japan, Germany, Russia, Indonesia and Brazil). In terms of GDP per head at PPP (at US$43,771 in 2017), the UK ranked 27th in the world and 11th in the EU28. GDP per head on a PPP basis is forecast at just below US$50,000 in 2022. The UK consumer market totalled US$1.7trn in 2017 and is projected to expand to more than US$2trn by 2021 as domestic demand recovers.
Growth in full-time employment and house prices, together with favourable credit conditions, has supported consumer spending over the past two years, despite a deterioration in purchasing power following the drop in the pound in 2016. Inflation accelerated, and amid falling real wages, consumers sustained desired levels of spending by saving less and taking on more debt. However this trend is likely to prove unsustainable, particularly as uncertainty about the implications of Brexit has started to weigh on house prices and consumer sentiment. The robust labour market and a recent return to mild growth in real wages should be supportive factors, but we expect growth in private consumption to slow in 2018-19.

Demand for healthcare and leisure will increase as society ages
The UK is a mature consumer market. Beyond the influence of a heightened period of economic uncertainty, and also cyclical factors, on consumer spending, demand will tend to be driven by a need to replace ageing stock, product development and technological change, and wider sociological factors. Demographic trends are likely to have an important effect on spending patterns over the coming years. The population of the UK is ageing, albeit less rapidly than in some other west European countries. The UK's ageing demographic profile, allied to sociological trends, will underpin demand for healthcare and leisure. However, income inequalities across the UK are higher than the west European average, and given the subdued outlook for income growth in the coming years, this trend is likely to persist-or deteriorate further-over the forecast period. The UK's Gini coefficient-where zero represents perfect income equality and 100 perfect income inequality-stands at 33.2, compared with a west European average of about 31.7.

Brexit notwithstanding, the UK is set to outperform its regional peers
Initial conditions: From the early 1990s up to 2008 the economic performance of the UK improved relative to that of many of its regional peers, owing in part to a sharp rise in labour utilisation. A similar pattern emerged in the wake of the global financial crisis, with strong employment growth fuelling a comparatively strong recovery in the UK. The pace of UK growth has since softened, and The Economist Intelligence expects this to continue in the next few years, particularly owing to sluggish productivity growth and Brexit uncertainty. We do not expect Brexit to have a negative effect on the country's long-term growth prospects, as many of the main factors underpinning this in our model are not related to EU membership. The UK's departure from the EU may have a mildly negative effect on some sources of growth such as external trade, but it may have a modestly positive effect on others, such as deregulation and fiscal transfers.
Over the long-term forecast horizon, which stretches to 2050, we expect economic performance to remain relatively robust. This reflects our view that the country's policymakers will adjust to the new reality over time and develop new pro-growth strategies. With comparatively robust demographic tailwinds-we do not anticipate a sharp post-Brexit tightening of immigration-trend rates of real GDP growth will be stronger in the UK than in Europe's other large economies. For example, our forecast for average annual UK real GDP growth of 1.8% in 2018-50 compares with figures of 1.4% in both Germany and France.
In terms of long-term growth prospects, the UK's advantages have traditionally included a comparatively low regulatory burden, a flexible labour market and a business environment that is conducive to foreign investment. These areas of economic management will be affected by Brexit, but we expect them to remain advantages for the UK. On the negative side, factors that tend to constrain the UK's long-term outlook include over-reliance on wealth effects generated by the volatile financial and real estate sectors, high levels of private-sector debt and a deficit in "intermediate" labour market skills. These have contributed to the development of an unbalanced economy. Levels of productivity in the UK, in terms of output per hour worked, lag well behind those in the US, Germany and France. This weak trend is worrying and will weigh on medium- and long-term growth if not reversed. There is a chance that the Brexit shock will result in a policy shake-up that will address some of the shortcomings that have underpinned this poor productivity performance.
Demographic trends: The working-age population is forecast to rise gradually over the long-term horizon, and the share of the population aged 65 or over will continue to increase. By 2050 those aged 65 and over are projected to account for 25.5% of the population (up from 18.5% in 2017). The share of the working-age population peaked at 66% in 2008-09 and is forecast to decline steadily to 58.3% by 2050. The labour force participation rate is just below 80%-slightly lower than in Denmark and Norway but well above the OECD average. This suggests that some scope exists for raising participation levels, but less than in most of the UK's peers.
The UK's trading relationships will be fundamentally altered by Brexit
External conditions: The UK is a highly trade-dependent economy and so its decision to leave the world's largest trading bloc will have implications for its long-term prospects. Proponents of Brexit argue that it will unleash the UK's trading potential in other parts of the world. We are sceptical about this argument. First, this new latitude in trade policy-as an EU member the UK is prohibited from agreeing trade deals on its own behalf-will probably come at the price of weaker trade links with the EU, which is the UK's most significant trading partner. Second, there may be deeper factors than EU membership that have hampered the UK's ability to expand its exports to the world outside the EU, such as weaker policy supports than are offered in many other EU countries, and a business culture that is less familiar with and enthusiastic about tackling the challenges involved in trading with new markets.
Multilateral trade liberalisation talks have been foundering in the face of increased political resistance, particularly in Europe and the US. Moreover, global trade growth has slowed significantly in the wake of the financial crisis-in part because of the changing structure of global supply chains-and remains at risk from an increase in protectionist sentiment. The development of the emerging economies in Asia, South America and parts of Africa will present both opportunities and challenges for UK companies. Amid some volatility-and a continued slowdown in China-we expect relatively solid growth to continue across the emerging world, changing the shape of the global economy and the role of major players on the world stage. Regardless of the precise contours of the UK's post-Brexit settlement, the EU is likely to remain the country's most important export destination. Given the demographic, structural and political headwinds that the bloc faces, we expect the EU's long-term growth to remain lacklustre. The underlying weakness of the euro zone also represents a significant tail risk to the UK, as it remains conceivable that it could lead to a partial or complete break-up of the currency bloc. This would be highly disruptive for the UK economy and its financial system.
Institutions and policy trends: The UK is a healthy democracy with a well-entrenched rule of law (guaranteeing security of contracts), liberalised product markets and a rigorous competition policy regime. The country's decision to leave the EU represents a break with decades of policy consensus. It remains too early to gauge how effectively policymakers and institutions will cope with the challenges involved in taking the UK out of the EU. Questions remain about the capacity of the government and bureaucracy to handle what lies ahead. Aside from dealing with Brexit, the UK must address long-standing weaknesses if it is to raise its overall level of productivity.
Long-term prospects depend on an improvement in productivity
Long-term performance: The UK has less scope for raising labour force participation than most other developed economies, so its long-term economic prospects will depend on raising productivity. It will have to meet three major challenges in this regard: improving its human capital by boosting intermediate and vocational skills; raising the quality of infrastructure for land transport; and relaxing the UK's strict planning regulations, which have contributed to a boom-bust cycle in the residential housing market, raised commercial rents, reduced competition and prevented firms from operating at their most efficient scale. A number of factors could prevent the UK from closing the productivity gap with some of its peers. Examples include the relative scarcity of land, which will require GDP growth to be balanced against other social objectives, and the UK's relatively low share of spending on R&D. The economy is forecast to grow at a respectable pace until 2050. However, many emerging-market economies will expand far more rapidly. Not only are their demographic profiles more favourable, but they also have significant potential for catch-up in areas ranging from institutional quality, regulatory efficiency and education to the application of information and communications technology (ICT).

Climate change and sustainability
The Climate Change Act (CCA) of 2008 established a legally binding target to cut UK greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and a framework to help to make sure that the target is achieved. The act commits the government to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% of 1990 levels by 2050 and requires the government to set legally binding "carbon budgets" as stepping stones towards the 2050 target. A carbon budget is a cap on the amount of greenhouse gases emitted over a five-year period. The first five carbon budgets have been put into legislation and cover the period up to 2032.
The CCA established the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), an independent, statutory body, to advise the government on emissions targets and report to parliament on progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing for climate change. The act also requires a five-yearly Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) and National Adaptation Programme (NAP) to address the identified risks and increase national resilience, and set out the UK government's objectives, proposals and policies for responding to these risks. The first CCRA was presented in 2012 and the second in January 2017. The government adopted a NAP in 2013, and another will be published in 2018.
The 2017 CCRA identified six priority areas requiring urgent action over the next five years.
Flooding and coastal change risks to communities, businesses and infrastructure.
Risks to health, well-being and productivity from high temperatures.
Risks of shortages in the public water supply, and for agriculture, energy generation and industry, with impacts on freshwater ecology.
Risks to natural capital, including terrestrial, coastal, marine and freshwater ecosystems, soils and biodiversity.
Risks to domestic and international food production and trade.
New and emerging pests and diseases, and invasive non-native species, affecting people, plants and animals.
The 2018 adaptation report will set out the main priorities for adaptation according to these six key themes. The first NAP in 2013 set out more than 370 actions for the UK government, businesses, councils, civil society and academia to address the findings of the first CCRA. The most recent review of the NAP in July 2017 found that the actions outlined in the 2013 programme had largely been delivered: 51% of actions were assessed as complete and an additional 35% were considered on track or continuing. New measures have been introduced in some priority areas, in part prompted by the severe storms and flooding in 2015-16. Measures include more funding for flood and coastal defence projects, and steps to encourage flood resilient repairs to be made to affected properties as standard practice. The 2017 review concluded that the next NAP in 2018 will need to be strengthened, in particular in the six priority areas identified in the 2017 CCRA. Overall, the UK government's readiness to address both adaptation and mitigation measures bodes well for the long-term outlook.
Technological developments
Technological change and innovation will be a determinant of growth over the coming decades. The capacity of countries to harness technological change and disruption will have a major impact on their long-term economic prospects. The UK has a relatively strong starting position in terms of the adoption and development of new technology. According to the technological readiness category of The Economist Intelligence Unit's Business Environment Rankings, the UK is well placed in terms of its openness to innovation, digital connectedness and preparation for technological disruption.
The UK performs well on all the main variables that determine a country's capacity to benefit from technological change. The UK's strengths include its education system, employment policies, ability to attract talented innovators, a sophisticated digital infrastructure, advanced e-commerce and e-business penetration, above-average digital skill levels and a well-developed framework of research and innovation infrastructure as a result of its strong scientific and university base. According to the 2018 edition of the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI), a composite index published by the European Commission, the UK is one of the highest-performing countries in Europe and performs well by global comparison too. The index brings together a set of 34 indicators across five principal policy areas.
Connectivity: fixed broadband, mobile broadband, fast and ultrafast broadband and broadband prices.
Human capital: basic skills and internet use, advanced skills and development.
Use of internet services: citizens' use of content, communication and online transactions.
Integration of digital technology: business digitisation and e-commerce.
Digital public services: e-government and e-health.
According to DESI, the UK is among the nine highest-performing countries in the EU, coming seventh behind Denmark, Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Ireland. The UK is a magnet for FDI into Europe, and industries at the technological frontier such as automotives, aerospace engineering, information and communication technology (ICT), biotechnology and micro-electronics have attracted much investment and international talent. Investment in London's Silicon Roundabout and other regions has helped to make the UK a leading technological hub.
However, the UK lags Europe's front-runners in other areas. The UK spends comparatively less on research and development (R&D) than its European peers; it spent 1.7% of GDP on R&D in 2016, below the EU average of 2% and well below the 3% of the best performers. Regarding automation, the UK lags Europe's front-runners such as Germany and some of the east European countries such as the Czech Republic. The UK industrial sector will have to work hard to increase automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies to remain at the technological frontier. The education system will also need to adapt to ensure that skills in ICT, especially in programming and operating robotic systems, are sufficiently widespread. Links between the science and business sectors will need to be strengthened as efforts to boost innovation continue.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2013-17) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2018-22). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2013-17. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2018-22 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2013-17 ranges are then used to derive 2018-22 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2018-22, not to the likely situation in 2022 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2015 or 2020). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Venezuela--highlights: Political outlook
By increasingly undemocratic means and greater reliance on the military, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has tightened its hold on power. Meanwhile, the main opposition grouping, the Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, has slid into disarray amid harassment from the PSUV's and its own penchant for infighting. However, the civic-military alliance maintaining the PSUV in power is eroding as oil production rapidly declines. The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast is that, as a way of gaining international legitimacy and financing, pragmatic military and civilian members of the ruling PSUV regime will allow some opposition participation by 2019. Outside of the threat of PSUV hardliners, this uneasy alliance will face substantial challenges to stability, as its attempts to correct the current severe macroeconomic distortions will affect entrenched interests, some of which may initially support the new administration. We expect the process to be chaotic and likely to feature several false starts. The possibilities of a prolonged period of chaos, an outright military dictatorship or a military-heavy government fronted by civilians remain potential outcomes.

Venezuela's position in our business environment ranking improves in 2018-22 to 80th place globally, nonetheless meaning that it remains one of the least attractive locations of the 82 countries covered in our rankings. This reflects unpredictable state inter-ventionism, highly heterodox macroeconomic policies, a lack of legal security and difficulties in accessing foreign exchange. Weak and politicised institutions, an unpredictable tax regime, a rigid labour market, and deteriorating infrastructure will also impair the business outlook. Assuming a political transition later in the forecast period, improvements will emerge. But these will take time, given the damage done by heterodox policymaking. There will also be only modest advances in addressing the country's structural constraints, and curbing corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency.

A combination of highly distortionary economic policies and subdued global oil prices will prolong Venezuela's recession in 2018-20. Large budget deficits-due to a narrow revenue base and dropping oil production-will continue to spur money printing, driving inflation. Oversupply of local currency, limited exports and foreign-exchange controls will fuel a black market for foreign currency despite continued devaluations of the official exchange rate. Our fore-casts for 2021-22 are more positive, based on the benign assumption that substantial international financial assistance will help a pragmatist admin-istration to stabilise the economy.

Venezuela will enjoy a structural demographic bonus in 2018-22, as it will experience a more rapid increase in its working-age population than in its overall population. The old-age dependency ratio will remain low by developed-country standards, but population ageing will place growing pressure on the heavily indebted social security system in a context of volatile public finances.

US-dollar measurements of Venezuela's market size provide an overly positive picture of the economy, given the marked overvaluation of the fixed exchange rate. The economic crisis and falling real incomes will continue to restrict purchasing power. Although Venezuela is generously endowed with natural resources, extremely challeng-ing conditions will keep private-sector investment well below potential.

Assuming a political transition in 2019 that will lift economic distortions and improve the business environment, we expect that Venezuela's economy will begin to recover. But the damage inflicted to the economy in recent years will prove difficult to reverse. As such, recovery will be gradual, with GDP growth averaging 0.9% annually in 2018-30. In 2031-50 we forecast that Venezuela's real GDP growth will pick up to 3.1% as rising investment in human capital boosts labour productivity growth, helping to offset deteriorating demographics. Persistent oil dependency will be difficult to undo, and a weak productive base will limit overall economic output.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has plummeted as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices has plunged the country into a massive economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded republican institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is how to stabilise an economy mired in a years-long economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. At the same time, mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign-exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Using IMF data, The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$21.1bn in 2017 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages. We estimate the current-account surplus at 1.3% of GDP that year.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
The ruling party, originally called the Movimiento V República and transformed into the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) in 2006, has been in power since 1999. The populist-nationalist PSUV was initially ruled by the late president, Hugo Chávez (1999-2013). Since Mr Chavez's death, the party has been led by the current president, Nicolás Maduro. Over most of its tenure, the PSUV has wielded practically uncontested power, initially owing to Mr Chavez's immense popularity, and later through electoral manipulation and systematic campaigns to disenfranchise opposition parties and sideline them from state institutions. The Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD) coalition is the largest opposition grouping, joining a series of small parties with the country's four largest: Primero Justicia, Acción Democrática, Un Nuevo Tiempo, and Voluntad Popular. The MUD holds a majority in the National Assembly, but the body is essentially powerless, as the PSUV-only Constituent Assembly (ANC) has granted itself remit over all legislative matters. The politicised Supreme Court (TSJ) and the executive have recognised the ANC, turning it into the country's de facto legislature and relegating the National Assembly.
This adverse context for the opposition has been compounded by the group's own penchant for infighting, with opposition figures often creating short-lived splinter groups and internal factions within parties. This has resulted in scepticism amongst the populace, even amongst the 70% or so of Venezuelans that oppose Mr Maduro. The MUD has attempted to re-launch itself by creating the Frente Amplio Venezuela Libre, composed of the MUD plus a wide-ranging group of non-governmental associations. The attempt, however, has been met with further suspicion from the public. Despite the opposition's weakness, the PSUV's unpopularity has meant that it increasingly relies on military personnel to maintain power. The arrangement is mostly fuelled by opportunities for corruption, resulting in patronage and in a variety of opaque internal civic-military factions that coexist within the regime.

Political outlook: Political stability
Despite a decimated economy and spiralling hyperinflation, the ruling PSUV and the president, Mr Maduro, retain their hold on power. However, we expect worsening economic conditions to result in a chaotic political transition, most likely ushering in a government with nominal opposition participation-a "mixed administration"-in 2019.
The opposition, of which the MUD is the biggest grouping, remains in disarray. Apart from infighting, this reflects the PSUV's systematic campaign to disfranchise opposition parties and sideline them from state institutions. After years of ineffectual leadership, most citizens, even those opposing the PSUV, distrust opposition parties. This has left them incapable of channelling the anti-government sentiment brewing in response to the country's dire economic situation.
In this context of unrest and repression, the PSUV is increasingly dependent on the military for support. The country is run by an alliance composed of civilians and military personnel identified with the PSUV, and a network of businessmen that enjoy military or political connections. The accord is sustained by opportunities for arbitrage and corruption schemes made possible by foreign-exchange controls; subsidised imports of basic goods; and control of large and inefficient public-sector companies. The ultimate source of resources flowing through this patronage train is PDVSA, the state-owned oil company, whose exports account for the vast majority of foreign-exchange inflows.
Jeopardising the arrangement is the rapid decline in oil production owing to mismanagement and underinvestment. Resultant strains have been exposed by purges of the military, the latest coming in March. Unless the administration turns PDVSA around (we see this as unlikely, as the government lacks the required expertise or financing), we believe that the patronage system supporting Mr Maduro will be at risk of collapse by late 2018 or early 2019.
What happens next is hard to predict, given the military's involvement in government and the opposition's weakness. The transition is likely to be violent. An outright military government is possible, as is internal re-organisation, with PSUV civilian figureheads fronting a military-heavy administration. Such administrations would probably look to Russia and China, erstwhile generous backers, for aid to stabilise both the economy and PDVSA. However, we believe that the required financing-tens of billions of US dollars per year-is beyond Russia's means. China, meanwhile has scaled back its relations with Venezuela since 2015. As such, financing will have to come from western sources-specifically multilaterals and governments-who would demand democratic reforms. Thus, we believe that the most likely outcome is a "mixed administration", in which pragmatically minded military and PSUV leaders allow opposition participation as a way of gaining inter-national legitimacy. There should be no shortage of opposition figures willing to participate. Indeed, Henri Falcón-the only opposition figure of relevance running in the May 20th presidential election-is running on a "mixed administration" platform.
The upcoming election introduces the risk that a mixed administration may be ushered into power before 2019. This is because the elections may trigger US sanctions on the oil trade, hastening the erosion of the patronage regime, as the US is PDVSA's largest cash-paying market. Similarly, arrears on bonded debt may lead to asset seizures in the US that impede trade. However, as no legal action has yet been taken, the timing of these is uncertain.
Regardless of its timing, the shift to a mixed administration will face challenges. The PSUV's internal stability is a concern, as the end of the current regime is likely to unleash jostling for prominence between PSUV factions. Secondly, the democratic reforms that western lenders would insist on may not be acceptable to some PSUV figures. If such hardliners persevere and financing is not attained, a mixed administration would lose its purpose. However, this would limit access to the foreign financing required to stabilise the economy, leaving patronage system in permanent peril. Therefore, we expect that a balance will be struck and foreign financing secured. However, the financing would underpin a macroeconomic programme that-by eliminating the economy's distortions-would close avenues for corruption and upset regime insiders, another destabilising pitfall. Other hurdles of uncertain size will remain. These include the judiciary, the de facto legislature that is the Constituent Assembly, and violent extremist supporters of the current regime known as colectivos.
Overall, we expect a chaotic transition starting in late 2018 or early 2019. The process will be highly uncertain and may feature several false starts. We expect curtailed political stability in 2019-22.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
In 2018-22 Venezuela will continue to suffer from one of the weakest political and institutional frameworks in the region. Under Mr Chávez, the decision-making process was characterised by arbitrary decisions, often subject to reversals, and the Maduro government has proved little different in this respect. There is scarce discussion of policy proposals among the wider public, and the technical quality of the laws passed is extremely patchy. Institutional effectiveness will remain very poor, undermined by a politicised judiciary and high levels of corruption. Moreover, the credibility of the country's institutions will continue to decline, with particular concerns about a lack of accountability and transparency, including in the use of public finances and the management of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company. The most extreme example of discretionary policymaking and the unstable institutional framework has been the installation of the ANC, which is solely composed of PSUV members, as the opposition boycotted its election. The ANC has given itself a two-year remit and has also expanded its responsibilities to include the legislative powers reserved to the National Assembly. It has become the government's main tool for pushing through its policies, stifling dissent and ensuring the PSUV's durability in power. In tandem with the TSJ and the National Electoral Council the ANC has stripped leading opposition figures and parties of their political rights, imposed electoral timetables that benefit the government, and passed laws suppressing dissent.
The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast assumes that by 2019 a "mixed administration" will be in power, in which pragmatically minded military and PSUV leaders will allow opposition participation under the guise of "national unity", as a way of gaining international legitimacy in order to access the foreign financing required to stabilise the economy. However, the process may feature a number of false starts and be highly fluid, as the internal dynamics within the civic-military PSUV alliance are extremely opaque. Once a modicum of stability is achieved, the mixed administration will continue to be constrained in its policymaking effectiveness, as it will be limited in its approach to key policy challenges. For example, massive corruption and clientelism in the provision of subsidised goods and utilities would be hard to eliminate without upsetting regime insiders and risking political stability. Similarly, PDVSA will be a crucial part of this process. The company is an enormous source of direct and indirect profits for regime insiders, but mismanagement and corruption there will need to be curtailed to a minimum to stabilise both the company and the country's macroeconomy. Foreign investment will need to be secured to lift output, but this will require a wholesale reform of the oil sector's institutional framework. This is itself an endeavour that will require considerable political capital, which will probably be in short supply.
Key to this and other institutional rehabilitation efforts will be the ANC and the TSJ, both of which are considered illegitimate by the opposition and most foreign governments. Depending of the balance of power within the new "unity" government and the PSUV, these bodies may continue to exist or be abolished. If they remain in place, an agreement of governability between them and the new regime will surely be needed.
Violent crime is expected to remain a major problem, fuelled by corruption in the judiciary and law enforcement. Drug-trafficking will remain a worrisome issue with criminal networks well established in the country. US authorities have repeatedly accused high-ranking military and civilian government members of drug-trafficking (those accused deny the allegations). Furthermore, the homicide rate has risen sharply over the past 15 years. According to official figures, Venezuela recorded a homicide rate of 58 per 100,000 people in 2015, although private sources claim that the rate was much higher. Subsequent measurements by a well-regarded local think-tank, the Observatorio Venezolano de Violencia, put the national murder rate in 2017 as high as 89 per 100,000, among the highest in the world. Aside from homicides, there have been numerous high-profile kidnappings for ransom in urban areas, a development that has increased concern over police corruption and mis-management. This increase in criminality will not be halted unless measures are adopted to improve the competence and effectiveness of law enforcement agencies and the criminal justice system, reduce rates of impunity, and boost youth employment.
Political outlook: Election watch
Elections for the presidency and municipal and state legislatures are scheduled for May 20th. Most of the opposition is boycotting the elections in protest of the rigged electoral process. Mr Falcón, a former MUD and PSUV member, is courting regime pragmatists to facilitate his victory by offering a path to regime change in a mixed-administration scenario, promising to start a "national reconciliation" and obtain international financing.
However, Mr Falcón must secure international and local legitimacy in order to show regime pragmatists that he is a credible alternative to Mr Maduro, something that he is yet to do. Mr Falcón is rumoured to be attempting to entice other opposition figures to abandon their boycott by offering to secure new electoral guarantees. We do not foresee success in those negotiations, as the current boycott stems from failed MUD-PSUV negotiations on electoral rules. However, further electoral postponements could well still take place in the run-up to the election, as the regime may fear further international sanctions following rigged elections. Following the installation of a mixed administration, an electoral timetable may be announced, as international financing will almost surely come with demands for democratic reforms.
Political outlook: International relations
Most regional governments have denounced the Venezuelan government, as has the EU. The most effective sanctions have come from the US, which has instituted country-level sanctions that deny Venezuela the possibility of refinancing its debts. Oil sanctions are not part of our baseline assumption, but the more hawkish US foreign policy team increases the risk of sanctions following the May 20th elections. A key priority for the Maduro administration will be the maintenance of good relations with Russia and China. Both have provided financing in the past, but seem unwilling to provide the several billions of dollars needed to stem the decline of oil output.

The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings place Venezuela among the world's least attractive investment locations during the historical period (2013-17). The country climbs one spot (to 80th place) for the current forecast period (2018-22). During the presidency of Nicolás Maduro, an extremely weak macroeconomic context and heightened political conflict has been added to the already weak institutional framework present during the preceding administration of Hugo Chávez (1999-2013). The slight improvement in the rankings reflects our expectation that a new government will, starting in 2019, usher in some economic reforms.
Improvement later in the forecast period assumes a political transition
Our forecasts currently assume that by late 2018 pragmatists in the military and the PSUV will allow opposition participation in government as a way to gain international legitimacy in order to access the foreign financing required to stabilise the economy. We expect this "mixed administration" to steady the economy and bring forth some improvements in business conditions. In particular, we expect better treatment of foreign investors, and less restrictive labour, tax and foreign-exchange conditions. However, political stability will be very fragile, reflecting entrenched interests, and the pressures from current administration extremists that will undoubtedly resist the mixed admin-istration's policies.

Given these concerns on political stability, the longstanding macroeconomic imbalances, the breadth and depth of regulation created during the Chávez and Maduro administrations, and the grave institutional decay of the past two decades, substantial changes to the business environment are unlikely during 2018-22.

Business environment outlook: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government persists with bias against free markets and ad hoc recourse to heterodox measures. Corruption and selective application of regulations (such as maximum prices) remain common and undermine free competition. Property rights remain weak.
2020-22: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Access to project financing is difficult and uncertainty over contractual rights persists.
2020-22: Efforts to attract foreign investment gather pace under a new government, although actual investment flows remain low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2018-19: Opaque currency controls add to uncertainty, severely restrict private-sector access to foreign exchange and impede trade. New government in 2019 starts removing exchange controls.
2020-22: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2018-19: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite the huge fiscal deficit. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2020-22: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2018-19: Amid severely high inflation, financing remains only available in the short term and banking sector shrinks in real terms.
2020-22: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2018-19: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. An ongoing freeze on redundancies, combined with a large informal sector and skill shortages, makes the labour market exceptionally rigid.
2020-22: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Underinvestment in the water and electricity grid ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2020-22: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued water and electricity rationing.
Technological readiness
2018-19: E-government services remain almost non-existent and deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies.
2020-22: Limited regulator capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage

The macroeconomic environment will remain weak
During the forecast period, Venezuela's macroeconomic environment will rank as the least attractive of all 82 countries covered in our index, barring Angola. This reflects several factors, most of which can be traced to the extremely poor management of economic policy, notwithstanding our expectation of more rational policymaking in the forecast period. Inherited imbalances and political stability concerns means that public deficits will remain high, as will inflation. The prolonged institutional decay of the past 20 years will be hard to reverse, as will the exodus of technocrats from government offices, which will keep policymaking quality low.
A collapse in international oil prices in 2014 brought with it a massive contraction of both exports and government revenue, as the oil sector (which provides the vast majority of exports) is dominated by PDVSA, the national oil company. Since then, the government has monetised subsequent fiscal deficits and severely rationed foreign exchange in order to both service external debt and afford subsidised food imports. The result of this has been a massive contraction of imports, high inflation, and a growing black market for both foreign currency and basic goods. Since late-2017, despite recovering oil prices, the dwindling production at PDVSA (itself caused by mismanagement and underinvestment) has exacerbated these problems and led to hyperinflation, a runaway black-market exchange rate, further shortages of basic goods, and the accumulation of arrears on external debts.
The current administration seems unable to formulate new policy thinking, resorting instead to ad-hoc interventionism, for example setting maximum prices, confiscating goods from retailers and distributors, and raiding banks suspected of facilitating black-market foreign-exchange transactions. The need for distortionary controls and ad-hoc interventionism stems from several years of unsustainable, expansionary macroeconomic policy, which is geared towards retaining government support.
By late-2018 or early 2019, we expect that collapsing oil production, which ultimately funds the patronage system, will lead to an internal fracture and change of administration, which we currently believe is most likely to take the form of a pragmatic but uneasy alliance between various current government and opposition members. This administration will, out of necessity, seek substantial foreign capital to help to return the economy to sustainable growth. To secure this investment, some moderate improvement in macroeconomic policymaking will take place. However, political stability, the depth of economic distortions that have built up over a prolonged period and the need to overhaul considerable portions of current regulations means that changes will be slow and they will take time to filter through to actual performance.

The score for policy towards private enterprise and competition will remain unaltered in 2018-22 and Venezuela's ranking in this category will be among the least business-friendly among the 82 countries assessed in the business environment rankings. Under our expectation of a new government in 2019, we expect little immediate improvement in the overall stance towards private enterprise. Most of the restrictive policies enacted against private enterprise can be traced to attempts at retaining support for the government from either entrenched economic elites or the public populace. Given our expectation of limited political stability, a reversal of current de facto and de jure limitations is unlikely.
Operating conditions have long been challenging, but the current government will refuse to alter its stance-characterised by bias against free markets, weak, politicised and inefficient institutions, and widespread price-fixing-despite the scale of the economic crisis. Uncertainty over contract and property rights, distortionary price and exchange controls, and the cumbersome burden of government regulation will continue to restrict businesses' freedom to compete under Mr Maduro.
Under Mr Maduro, there have been fewer takeovers of private companies, partly reflecting that performance in nationalised firms has slipped since the government's intervention. However, the threat of state interference remains high, especially in the politically sensitive sectors of financial services, and food production and distribution. The government has recently begun a 90-day intervention in Venezuela's largest bank, Banesco, ostensibly to curb black-market foreign-exchange transactions. Raids, fines and confiscations on retailers violating maximum prices are a common occurrence and will continue under Mr Maduro.
Our expectation of little improvement in 2018-22 reflects the complex legal framework that sustains the current economic distortions, and the political and economic instability that is expected to reign in the country in the forecast period. In the context of the institutional decay that has occurred in recent years, improving competition policy, and restricting lobbying and corruption would require an overhaul of regulatory bodies and legal frameworks that would take years.

Policy under a successor government is likely to be much friendlier for investors
Venezuela's score and ranking for policy towards foreign investment improves between the historical and forecast period, reflecting anticipated changes in policy stance under our forecast mixed administration in 2019. However, the score will remain low and Venezuela will continue to rank low in both the overall and regional rankings. We expect that, to coax necessary foreign investment, the new government will improve investor protections, reduce the threat of expropriation and display less favouritism to firms hailing from politically sympathetic countries.
Although the 1999 constitution establishes national treatment for foreign capital, in practice the government has prioritised investment from firms tied to, or owned by, friendly governments, thereby diminishing opportunities for other firms. The fact that the World Bank's International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) is currently considering 17 cases lodged by companies affected by the nationalisation drive under Mr Chávez will prove a further disincentive to foreign companies, particularly as there is little indication that the Maduro regime has either the will or the ability to make compensation payments. Indeed, close to a dozen cases have already been ruled on by the ICSID, with awards against the Venezuelan government totalling close to US$5bn. The government has only agreed payment plans on a limited number of these cases, and only under threat of seizures in foreign courts.
We expect the next government to take a friendlier approach towards foreign investment in the hopes of inciting investors to rebuild the decimated domestic productive capacity. The improvement in the score and ranking reflects our expectation that the risk of nationalisation and/or expropriation will be lower under the next government.
We expect the next government to focus its efforts in attracting investment into the oil sector given its importance to the country's economic health. Even under the Maduro administration PDVSA has partnered with private companies, with the majority of joint ventures being related to production or refining of extra-heavy oil from the Orinoco belt. Official data is not available but estimates on production suggest that it is these joint ventures that have kept production from dropping further as output in operations fully controlled by PDVSA have collapsed. Under the new government, these efforts will be expanded. This will almost certainly require a reform of the current legal framework, which caps foreign participation in joint ventures at 40%. However, this will require considerable political capital and, as such, more aggressive measures (such as partly privatising PDVSA or the elimination of the requirement that PDVSA be involved in all oil projects) will be difficult to see through.

Easing currency controls will prove difficult and will progress only slowly
We expect a slight improvement in conditions in this category between 2013-17 and 2018-22, but not enough to alter Venezuela's global ranking. Although official policy towards foreign investors will improve under a new government later in the forecast period, easing capital controls will prove extremely challenging, with the process likely to be gradual. Even by the end of the forecast period, access to foreign currency is likely to be restricted, hampering foreign trade.
As long as Mr Maduro remains in power, he will retain stringent controls on foreign currency, with problems relating to the exchange regime representing a major barrier to foreign trade. Current exchange controls (introduced in 2003) have been progressively tightened amid growing balance-of-payments problems. In practice, the private sector has no access to the official rate. The preferential exchange rate known as Dipro of BsF10:US$1 was eliminated in January 2018 and in theory both private- and public-sector transactions are done through the Dicom, a heavily managed foreign-exchange auction system. However, the government-which monopolises the country's export sector-has not supplied the auction system with foreign-exchange, making the system unsustainable and dollars essentially impossible to find at the official rate. Since the start of the year the Dicom rate has devalued by 94%, and the latest auction, held in early May, set the Dicom rate at BsF69,000:US$1. Even at that rate of depreciation, demand vastly outstrips supply; the black-market exchange rate was over BsF650,000:US$1 in early May. Given the depth of distortions, there is a possibility that the country may be forced to dollarise or adopt a new domestic currency at some point in the forecast period.
Difficulty in remitting profits earned in Venezuela will remain one of the most significant challenges of doing business for foreign companies operating in the country. Capital controls mean that official permission is required to remit profits, but with foreign exchange being scarce, remittances are waitlisted. Many foreign-owned companies have not been able to remit their profits for several years. With the Dicom rate depreciating at such a rapid pace, the waitlisted profit remittances lose value in dollar terms. This will continue to happen the medium term. Reports of foreign companies choosing to mothball operations or wind down their presence in the Venezuelan market are common.
Bilateral trade partners will continue to struggle in their relations with the Maduro government. Restricting foreign exchange to the private sector has resulted in a plummeting of imports. Outside of exchange controls, red tape, corruption and inefficiency also hinder trade, and corruption in the customs service will remain endemic. The acute foreign-exchange shortage has meant that even public-sector imports have been limited or gone without payment. Indeed, public complaints from trade partners about non-payment to suppliers are a regular occurrence and the trend is likely to continue. Even imports from known economic and political allies have dropped drastically since the beginning of the recession. Official data are not available, but IMF data show that between 2014 and 2017 imports from China decreased by 71% and from Russia by 88%.
Under the next administration, we expect some macroeconomic reforms, the return of international credit and a correction in PDVSA. This will aid balance--of-payment dynamics and will facilitate the gradual removal foreign-exchange controls. However, the pace of removals will largely depend on how successful the mixed administration is at restoring international credit and turning PDVSA around. Overall, we expect limited progress, as shown by the discrete increase in score.

Improvements in the tax regime are likely under an opposition government
The tax regime will remain a constraint to investment but will undergo some minor improvements under a new government later in the forecast period. Rates of direct corporate taxation are currently moderate, with a top corporate income tax rate of 34% (excluding oil companies, for which the rate is set at 50%), but tax laws, regulations and procedures are complicated, inconsistent and subject to frequent arbitrary adjustments. A series of new taxes introduced in 2009 in many cases doubled the effective tax rate on earnings. These taxes formed part of wider reforms such as a sports law, a new science and technology law, a worker training law, and a municipal law, but included new fiscal charges on businesses, some of which are levied on gross revenue rather than net earnings. The measures are unlikely to be rolled back under the Maduro government. The new government may reverse some, but the deteriorated state of public finances imposes limits on tax cuts.
The tax base is narrow: according to the latest official data disclosed by Venezuela's tax authority (Seniat), tax income accounted for just 12% of GDP in 2012. The Seniat regularly reports massive increases in tax collection (in March the year-on-year increase was over 900%) but given hyperinflation, tax collection is actually shrinking in real terms. Despite the recent deterioration in the public finances, we do not believe that tax rises are likely under the current administration. Mr Maduro has shown little interest in raising revenue to offset massive increases in public spending and appears content with financing the huge fiscal deficit through public debt issuance, which is monetised, driving hyperinflation. In addition, the president will be reluctant to pass measures that would further alienate his already-dwindling support base.
Based on our assumption that a new government will take over and begin enacting policy adjustments later in the forecast period, we expect efforts will be focused-at least initially-on improving compliance-a difficult task, given the deterioration of state institutions over the course of the past 15 years.

Financing conditions will remain difficult
Venezuela's score for financing deteriorates in the forecast period, given the weak state of the banking sector and on the assumption that improvements in access to medium-term finance for the private sector, and in eliminating distortions, will occur only beyond the forecast period. The government has continued its policy of directed lending, which requires private banks to channel credit to specific sectors at preferential rates (including agriculture, mortgages and tourism).
In nominal terms, bank credit grew by almost 6000% in 2013-2017, reflecting a captive domestic liquidity and spiralling inflation. In real terms, however, we estimate that this represented a 92% contraction. For companies borrowing from local banks, credit remains predominantly short term. As only a small percentage of the population has sufficient funds to purchase investment and savings products, the capital market also remains shallow. Following a political transition, we expect interest rates to be gradually rationalised, but sector-specific measures will also be required and financing will remain a major weakness of the business environment throughout the forecast period.
In early May 2018, the government announced a 90-day intervention in Venezuela's largest bank, Banesco. The intervention may be the start of a nationalisation drive of the banking sector. The impact of such move would be limited both for the public finances and for financing conditions, as the banking sector's deposits and loans have been decimated in real terms, making them irrelevant as a source of potential wealth for the government or credit to the private sector.
The soundness of the financial system and the quality of regulation will remain key concerns. A bout of instability in 2009 prompted the government to take control of a number of small banks and brokerage houses. The government passed new legislation in 2010, but this has not resulted in a tighter regulatory framework. In line with reform legislation passed in other sectors, the government has simply established a new layer of bureaucracy, rather than trying to tackle the patchy enforcement of existing regulations. Weak skills in regulatory agencies and political meddling in oversight decision-making will remain problems and will continue to undermine efforts to identify and support ailing banks at an early stage.
A removal of the many price, export, capital and foreign-exchange controls after an expected political transition would be risky to the stability of the financial system. For instance, normalisation of interest rates would almost surely have an adverse effect on loan performance and credit creation. Careful co-ordination with the country's banks to reduce pressures on the financial system will be required. The gradual lifting of the directed lending system would also allow for better allocation of resources and the medium-term stabilisation of interest rates.

Labour market rigidities will persist under the Maduro regime
Venezuela's labour market will remain among the least flexible in the world in 2018-22. Although a marginal improvement in the underlying score is expected as a new government begins to take steps to ease the highly-regulated labour market, the process will be gradual and come only at the end of the forecast period, meaning that the impact on the overall score in 2018-22 will be very limited. The highly distorted exchange-rate system makes it virtually impossible to assess wage costs in US dollar terms in comparison with the rest of the region. However, a 2012 labour reform increased non-wage costs considerably: obligatory non-wage costs, employers' social security contributions, mandatory profit sharing, and childcare and food allowances added more than 70% to the basic wage costs for large and medium-sized companies, and 30% for smaller companies. Under the assumption of a political transition, we expect some of the most egregiously restrictive regulations to be reformed later in the forecast period.
Wage and non-wage costs come on top of a long-standing firing freeze, under which staffing levels (excluding managers, short-term workers and high-income earners) can be reduced only via collective agreement. Some workers cannot be fired at all, including, for example, pregnant women and their partners, and workers with children with a disability or illness. In practice, companies looking to shed staff are forced to negotiate "voluntary redundancy" agreements with workers; these typically centre on extremely generous severance payments, further adding to employment costs. Employment tribunals are generally hostile to private-sector employers, a factor used by workers and union representatives to their advantage. Moreover, companies that make recourse to voluntary redundancies have at times been targeted for nation-alisation, representing a further disincentive for the private sector.
Finding skilled labour would be likely to remain problematic even under an opposition-led government, as the results of decades of underinvestment in education will take time to reverse, meaning that even basic skills will remain scarce in much of the workforce. Chronic underinvestment in scientific and technical skills, as well as political interference in universities and technical colleges, has damaged the quality of the country's tertiary education system. Massive emigration has also taken its toll. No official data exists, but local estimates put total emigration in the past two decades at close to 3m people, with over 1m having left in the past two years. Anecdotal evidence suggests that among those leaving, a large proportion were middle-class professionals with good employment prospects abroad. This has worsened skill shortages. Although some are more likely to return to the country under our assumption of regime change, this is unlikely to gather substantial pace during the 2018-22 forecast period, as many Venezuelans will wait until the political and economic situation stabilises before returning.

Underinvestment will cause many services to deteriorate
Following years of mismanagement and underinvestment, Venezuela's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and we only expect marginal improvement in 2018-22. Despite repeated pledges by the government to implement ambitious infrastructure projects, state-led investment under Mr Maduro has been and will remain erratic, and most plans are unlikely to advance. A post-transition government will be keen on making up the shortfalls, but progress will be limited owing to fiscal constraints and the difficulties in attracting long-term foreign direct investment into infrastructure. Some multilateral assistance should be forthcoming.
Reliable access to electricity will be one of the main causes for concern for businesses operating in Venezuela in 2018-22. Frozen nominal electricity tariffs have led to rapid growth in demand in recent years. Water levels at the Guri dam-which generates most of the country's hydropower (which, in turn, accounts for over 50% of total electricity generation)-have recovered from critically low levels, but with little new capacity coming on stream, the country will remain highly exposed to drought. In addition, chronic underinvestment in the transmission and distribution network has resulted in repeated and widespread blackouts across the country. Overhauling the entire system will likely take years, meaning that electricity rationing and unscheduled or scheduled blackouts will remain a risk through 2022.
Problems with the water supply service are widespread and mounting. According to the 2011 census, 85% of Venezuelan households received running water. However, the situation has since drastically changed owing to lack of maintenance. There have even been reports of untreated waters reaching the faucets and a well-regarded local non-governmental organisation, Médicos por la Salud, estimates that around 79% of public hospitals do not have a regular supply of water. Although electricity cuts are currently the main concern for producers, irregular supply of water will undoubtedly also affect the business environment.
Government policies complicate air travel. Long delays in authorising the remittance of international air carriers' profits outs of Venezuela have prompted several carriers to reduce or suspend services. Data compiled by ProDavinci, a reputable news and commentary site, reveals that the number of available seats on international flights to and from Venezuela dropped by 63% between 2013 and 2017. The reduced service, coupled with firm demand (as Venezuelans have sought to travel overseas to bring US dollars back into the country, where they can sell them on the black market), has sent airfare prices soaring. Moving freight through the country's ports, which are under military control, has also proven complex; reports of corruption are common

This section, introduced as part of an upgrade to our rankings in 2018, aims to show how future-oriented the business environment is-the extent to which it is digitally connected, open to innovation and prepared for technological disruption.
Venezuela is not well prepared for technological disruption
As in all other categories of the business environment rankings, Venezuela ranks extremely poorly at both the regional and global level. In 2018-22 the score drops slightly, on the expectation that the quality of internet services will continue to deteriorate, reflecting increased demand and lack of investment.
Price and tariff regulations affect the quality of technological infrastructure in Venezuela, because high consumption levels are not matched by capital expenditure. Chronic underinvestment in scientific and technical skills, and massive "brain drain" also limit Venezuela's technological readiness. Moreover, acute skills shortages in technology will not be resolved in the short term, and private investors will wait for the political and economic situation to stabilise before making substantial capital expenditure commitments.
Although the Maduro administration, like the Chávez government before it, has directed state investment towards a variety of high-tech sectors, resources have been allocated inefficiently. For instance, the administration funded the construction of a factory to manufacture mobile telephones, but underinvested in the mobile network infrastructure, leading to poor service. Similarly, the government also built a factory to build educational computers, but school curriculums, educational materials and teaching standards have not been revised to train children in computer programming.
Internet and mobile network services are some of the cheapest in the world. However, lags in price adjustments make it difficult to cover the rising cost of maintaining the level and quality of the services. In addition, theft of equipment from companies' network infrastructure is common. As a result, service is unreliable and internet speeds are low even when compared with neighbouring countries.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
The government remains unable and unwilling to undertake the policy changes needed to address its main challenges, namely declining oil production, spiralling hyperinflation and mounting arrears on external debt. Most sovereign and state-owned firms' bonds (including those of PDVSA) are now in arrears, but the government maintains that it has not defaulted, despite calling for debt restructuring. Restructuring appears impossible, owing to US financial sanctions and, more fundamentally, because the government lacks a credible economic programme. There is no sign yet of lawsuits by bondholders, who so far appear to prefer the promise of late payment to lengthy legal battles. Investors may also be waiting for news of policy changes following May election or a change in country leadership. In the meantime, the both the sovereign and PDVSA are open to legal challenges in the US. This is especially concerning for PDVSA, as it could involve seizure of assets, including Citgo, a US-based PDVSA subsidiary, which could impede exports, the regime's economic lifeline.
In the meantime, the government must grapple with a build-up of inflationary and currency depreciation pressures. Monetisation of large public deficits and dwindling exports has led to foreign currency rationing and hyper-inflation. The government has devalued the official exchange rate, but monetary imbal-ances persist and foreign-exchange continues to be rationed. Economic policy will remain interventionist in the short term, deepening the economic crisis that drives our baseline forecast of a move towards a mixed administration.
Under our baseline scenario, we expect more orthodox economic policies to be implemented. However, the administration will face considerable internal limitations in addressing key policy challenges. For example, wastefulness at state-owned firms and massive corruption and clientelism schemes built around the delivery of subsidised goods and services would be hard to roll back without antagonising government backers, risking political instability. Thus, we would expect a mixed administration to focus on macroeconomic essentials, such as the stabilisation of the currency and local prices, and tackling mismanagement of PDVSA.
Our benign baseline assumption is that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and multilaterals (totalling US$19bn in 2019-22) and the restructuring of the government's debt obligations. Internal cohesiveness in the "mixed administration" will be key, as the PSUV is ideologically opposed to such borrowing and multilateral financing is likely to come with conditions on democratic reforms. Meanwhile, PDVSA must open itself to foreign investment to secure the finance needed to bring output back on track. This will require considerable political capital, as it would imply a wholesale revision of the sector's institutional framework. Pockets of resistance are likely to exist. Internal stability within the PSUV will remain a major risk to our forecast, as the success of a mixed administration would depend on PSUV pragmatists fending off more radical party members, who would oppose accepting international assistance and reforming policy.
Outside of these areas, we do not expect much success in rolling back the PSUV's strong interventionist bent in the economy. As a result, we expect extremely limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will limit economic recovery and fuel continued unrest.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy

Government debt 23.7 17.5 10.2 16.3 22.3 19.2

Authorities have not published data on fiscal accounts since 2011, when the non-financial public-sector (NFPS) deficit was 12% of GDP. We forecast an NFPS deficit of 15.5% of GDP in 2018, which will largely be financed by printing money. High inflation and the overvalued official exchange rate make debt/GDP ratios misleading indicators of fiscal stability. Considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) understates the true size of total public liabilities.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect a restructuring with external creditors in 2020. Owing to the need to maintain political stability, we do not expect the closure of the various handout programmes in operation, nor the removal of utility subsidies or the reformation of inefficient state-owned firms. Therefore, we expect public expenditure to be hard to reduce; we expect the deficit to be substantial throughout the 2018-22 period, ending 2022 at 6.9% GDP.

The government will take three zeroes off the currency on June 4th, but has not announced any change in policy. We expect a new administration to place a much greater emphasis on tackling hyperinflation, and expect a substantial monetary adjustment in the context of a macroeconomic stabilisation plan.

Economic forecast: Economic growth
Amid ongoing disruption to Venezuela's productive base and a collapse in consumer spending, we project further contractions in real GDP in 2018-20, following an estimated contraction of 13.9% in 2017. Our forecast recovery in 2021-22 rests on the assumption of a political transition that, supported by IMF financial and institutional assistance, produces a credible macroeconomic programme with improved management of the country's oil wealth at its centre. However, the reform programme will be limited in scope by a weak government, and we only expect a partial rebound in real GDP, following a decline of over 50% in 2013-20.

Private consumption will continue to contract in 2018, reflecting the effect on real wages of hyperinflation as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will continue to contract as well, reflecting the difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange. Our forecast for a recovery in investment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition and a pick-up in investment in the oil sector. Oil output-already in the midst of a long decline owing to mismanagement and underinvestment-has contracted beyond expectations in recent months; we now expect it to bottom out at 1.2m barrels/day (b/d) in early 2020, down from an average of 1.95m b/d in 2017. Under our baseline forecast of openness to foreign investment under a new government from around 2019, oil production will start a recovery in the second half of 2020, but will remain below 2m b/d even at the end of our forecast period in 2022. Export volumes will only start to recover in 2021, as an increase in domestic demand, which has been artificially constrained, will initially absorb the increase in oil output. For the same reason, import demand will rise sharply.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Oil sector: With proven levels approaching 300bn barrels, Venezuela has the largest reserves in the world, making it a major oil producer and exporter. However, the energy sector has suffered from disinvestment and mis-management owing to political interference. The state is accorded exclusive ownership of PDVSA, the nationalised oil and gas firm, and its subsidiaries. Since 2007 oil exploration, extraction and storage activities have been reserved for state-owned enterprises or companies in which the state holds a stake of at least 60%.
The latest PDVSA data put oil output at an average of 2.6m barrels/day (b/d) in 2016, while OPEC estimates put it at 2.2m, in line with data from the International Energy Agency (IEA). Regardless, in 2017 and the start of 2018 PDVSA's output has fallen dramatically as underinvestment and mis-management take their toll. Latest IEA data estimate output at 1.5m b/d in March, making Venezuela vastly over compliant with the 2.1m b/d ceiling agreed with OPEC. Official data is not available, but production estimates suggest that it is joint ventures with foreign investors that have kept output from dropping further. As the joint ventures deal predominately in heavy and extra-heavy oil, and as production of lighter oil is collapsing, PDVSA has been forced to import more diluents from the US, further damaging its already crippled finances.
PDVSA's main joint-venture partners are Russian firms (Gazprom, Lukoil and Rosneft), CNPC (the Chinese state oil company), Chevron (US) and Eni (Italy). The government has shown a preference for Russian and Chinese firms, but even co-operation with these partners has reportedly been rocky at times given, among other things, pervasive corruption at PDVSA, complex regulatory and planning requirements, difficulties securing foreign exchange to afford production imports, and criminality in areas surrounding at oil production and refining facilities.
Dwindling production and a punishing debt redemption schedule have stretched PDVSA's financing to its limits. Suppliers and oil services firms have denounced delays in payments. Schlumberger, a US-based oil services firm, reportedly scaled back operations in Venezuela in 2016 and in 2017 wrote off at least part of PDVSA's debts. PDVSA has also fallen behind on its external debt obligations, with a majority of its almost US$30bn in outstanding external bonded debt accumulating arrears. One of the bonds that PDVSA remains current on, which matures in 2020, has 50% of Citgo, a PDVSA subsidiary, as a collateral. Another 50% of Citgo is reported collateral on a loan extended by Rosneft. Citgo has been a vital part of PDVSA's operations, as it refines and commercialises Venezuelan oil in the US, PDVSA's largest cash-paying market. As such, losing control of Citgo would be a substantial setback for PDVSA. In November 2017 Mr Maduro dismissed PDVSA's CEO and the country's oil minister in a move ostensibly aimed at improving management and reducing corruption. However, the move seems in reality to have been politically motivated, and improvements in management under the Maduro admin-istration are extremely unlikely.
As such, PDVSA's financial difficulties and perennial mismanagement suggests that the current decline in output is irreversible for as long as the present government remains in power. With PDVSA in debt arrears and unable to articulate a credible restructuring plan to creditors, we expect that a turnaround of the oil sector will only be possible after a new government is in office. We expect that any new government will prioritise the improved management of PDVSA and will attempt to open the company to increased co-operation with international investors (and perhaps even allow outright foreign operations in the country), a necessity given that PDVSA will be unable to afford the required investments. However, this will require a complete overhaul of the sector's current legal framework, which will require considerable political capital, and which remains uncertain.

A decimation of domestic supply, severe limits on imports and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official data have not been published since 2015, but the opposition-led National Assembly has estimated that monthly inflation was 67% in March, bringing year-on-year inflation to over 9,000%. We expect inflation to average over 10,000% in 2018. There is a high risk of a hyperinflationary spiral in coming months that increases inflation to well above our current forecast and necessitates a dramatic adjustment, probably involving a resort to currency substitution.

Since the start of the year the government has devalued the official exchange rate by over 94%. The rate is supposedly determined by an auction system, but the government-which mono-polises the country's exports-has not supplied the system with foreign-exchange, making the system unsustainable and access to foreign exchange practically impossible, even at the current rates. In early May the black-market exchange rate was around BsF650,000:US$1; the official rate stood at BsF69,000:US$1.
Given the existing distortions in the foreign-exchange market and growing hyperinflation, the government may, as part of a stabilisation plan, introduce a new domestic currency or attempt some kind of currency substitution in the future. Under our current political assumptions, similar measures may be undertaken after 2019. The exact nature and implementation of the plan is hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period.

We expect the current-account surplus to reach US$6bn in 2018 (2.6% of GDP at the distorted exchange rate, which overstates the GDP in dollar terms), owing to continued import compression. However, Venezuela's lack of access to foreign finance means that the current-account surplus will not be enough to meet the country's financing needs. Indeed, excluding arrears, we calculate that principal repayments of sovereign and state-owned companies' bonded debt alone will amount to US$3.5bn in 2018. As such, we expect further arrears in 2018 and 2019. By 2020, with a new government in power, we expect that-following a debt renegotiation-external financing will be restored and imports will begin a recovery. We expect the current account to go into a deficit of 4.8% of GDP in 2020 at a less highly distorted exchange rate. Recovering oil production and the re-structured interest payment schedule facilitate a narrowing of the current-account deficit to 3.2% of GDP in 2022.
Assuming that a new administration takes power from around 2019, we expect financial and investment inflows to provide sufficient financing, stabilise balance-of-payments dynamics and help to rebuild reserves coverage. However, there are considerable risks to this rosy outlook. In addition to anticipating a "mixed administration" capable of retaining power, it hinges on a substantial assistance package from the IMF, the quick implementation of a successful macroeconomic stabilisation package, the fast resolution of a debt renegotiation process within 2019-20, substantial inflows of financial and real investment into the economy in 2020-22, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Venezuela
Stocks and flows
According to the IMF (whose figures differ somewhat from local sources), the stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Venezuela stood at US$30.1bn in 2016, the last year in which actual data have been provided. This is around one-third less than a peak of US$48.9bn in 2007 and is primarily the result of significant disinvestment, notwithstanding the government's strict capital controls. Using the overvalued official exchange rate (which overstates GDP in dollar terms) the FDI stock was 5.3% of GDP, a massive drop from the nearly 50% of GDP of 2003. Overall, FDI inflows have been very volatile in the past 20 years, affected by both political and macroeconomic factors. During the oil opening of 1996-98, inward FDI peaked at an annual average of US$4.4bn a year. By historical standards, inward FDI held up well in the first three years of the presidency of Hugo Chávez (1999-2013), averaging US$3.8bn per year in 1999-2001. As political conflict intensified, FDI inflows began to decline in 2002-08 (averaging US$1.8bn per year), and in 2009-a year of great volatility in the world economy and adverse domestic developments in Venezuela-the country registered disinvestment of US$1.1bn (some negative inflows were also the result of compensation for nationalisations). Inward FDI has recovered afterwards, averaging an estimated US$4.3bn per year in 2011-13, because of greater investment from China in energy and housing. It declined considerably afterwards, to US$1.9bn a year in 2014-16, likely as a reflection of both sliding international oil prices and foreign investors increasing disillusionment with the government's inability to comply with investment agreements and manage the economy. Outbound FDI in Venezuela is considerable, reaching a stock of US$32.7bn in 2016. However, this tally is dominated by investments abroad by PDVSA, the state oil company.
Origin and distribution
The energy sector, and oil in particular, remains the main magnet for FDI. US and European oil companies have major investments in the country, even after forced changes to the ownership structure of most contracts. After oil, banking and communications have been the main recipients of FDI. Spanish banks have the largest foreign presence in the financial sector, although the Venezuelan state has bought back some operations. Other notable FDI inflows come from Chile (in forestry activities) and Canada (in the mining industry). In recent years Venezuela has courted new investment partners in Brazil, China, Russia and Iran, with limited success. Domestic economic problems in most of these countries mean that short-term efforts will be focused on seeking investment from China and Russia.
Determinants
Following a period of booming FDI inflows in the 1990s, driven by oil and telecommunications openings, an uncertain political and policy environment-including threats of nationalisation-and a volatile macroeconomic climate have served to keep FDI well below potential, particularly in the non-extractive sectors. In the extractive sector, FDI inflows have been affected by the government's restrictive hydrocarbons investment regime, which mandates that PDVSA must hold a minimum 60% stake in the oil and gas sector and levies high taxes and royalties on private partners. The vast reserves of extra-heavy oil in the Orinico Belt require substantial technical know-how and massive investment to be put to production, an environment where major oil companies would thrive. Many major companies are already present via joint ventures or were already present before nationalisation drives. Venezuela's oil sector will continue to be a major draw to FDI under more sustainable economic and regulatory policies.
Impact
Foreign investment in oil brought accelerated growth in output, from 2.4m barrels/day (b/d) in 1994 to a peak of 3.4m b/d in 1999. Foreign investment in the extractive sector has fallen since then, contributing to a decline in oil output, reinforced by PDVSA's inability to drive production. Foreign involvement has had a less dramatic impact in other sectors, such as domestic manufacturing or services, but this in turn has resulted in high levels of import dependence. As FDI has flowed mostly into capital-intensive industries, its impact on employment and skills levels has been limited.
Potential
Potentially attractive opportunities for FDI exist in an array of sectors, such as oil and gas, petrochemicals, coal, aluminium, gold, forestry, power, tourism and telecoms. There is additional potential in some manufacturing and agricultural niches (for example, leather goods, cocoa and rum). Further comparative attractions are Venezuela's transport infrastructure, which, despite lack of investment and maintenance, is still fairly good by regional standards, and the country's strategic geographic location. However, FDI inflows will be severely curtailed by concerns over the government's policy stance, difficulties in accessing foreign exchange, the weak macroeconomic environment and the fragility of the legal framework. A more noticeable upturn in FDI inflows will have to wait until after a political transition takes place, insofar as the new government undertakes a commitment to improve the business environment, address exchange-rate distortions and controls local prices.

A demographic bonus will be wasted as a result of economic woes
Although population growth will remain weak because of a falling birth rate, Venezuela will enjoy a demographic bonus in 2018-22, but this will be largely squandered as a result of poor economic policies and a resulting deep recession that has left a greater proportion of the population outside the labour force. The annual population growth rate has been steadily decreasing from 2.8% in the 1980s to 2.3% in the 1990s and 1.8% in 2000-10, and reaching 1.2% in 2013-17. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the annual rate of population growth to tick up slightly, averaging 1.3% in 2018-22. Part of the slowdown in population growth has been growing emigration since the 2000s. No official data exist, but local estimates put total emigration in the past two decades at close to 3m people, with over 1m having left in the past two years. The small increase in population growth in 2018-22 assumes a reversal of this trend as political and economic stability improves with the arrival of a new government. This will lead to a rise in the participation rate and a faster growth rate in the labour force compared with that of the working-age population. The total population is expected to reach 33.5m by 2022, with just over one-quarter of the population under the age of 14 and two-thirds of the population between 15 and 64 years of age. Population density is low, at 34 people/sq km as per official estimates from 2017. Distribution between urban and rural areas is highly uneven, with around 90% of the total population living in urban centres. Underdeveloped rural infrastructure, limited job opportunities in the countryside and fixed agricultural prices (in many cases, below the cost of production) will result in a continuing trend of urbanisation in 2018-22, creating problems in the main cities.
The labour participation rate declined in 2004-12 (owing to an increased uptake of education linked to the government's social programmes), but ticked up marginally in 2013 and 2014, before falling again in 2015 as economic conditions worsened as job seekers became discouraged. The government has stopped producing labour data, but we expect that continued economic contraction and diminishing real wages (we estimate that, in real terms, the minimum wage plus food vouchers has lost some 95% of its value since mid-2013) has driven participation down further. Although we are forecasting some improvement later in the forecast period as the economic crisis is reversed, we expect the participation rate to remain below 70% until 2022. A very poor business environment, economic malaise and extremely restrictive labour regulation will continue to limit job creation, forcing more people to seek work in the informal sector, which is already estimated to account for around half of employment. According to the authorities, the official unemployment rate fell from 8.5% in 2010 to 6.8% in 2015. However, given that this coincided with a sharp deterioration in local economic conditions, it is likely that it reflects inflexible labour laws (which make it virtually impossible to lay off workers) rather than any significant job creation. It is also possible that the data are unreliable, as it is highly implausible that unemployment has remained low in the midst of a deep economic recession, with a growing number of companies folding.
Poverty indicators improved during the tenure of Hugo Chávez (1999-2013), but these data are no longer published by the authorities. Independent academic sources estimate that poverty rates have risen sharply in the context of collapsing economic activity and hyperinflation. A study by three well-regarded universities estimated the poverty rate at 87% in 2017. Shortages of medicines and surgical supplies are creating huge problems in the healthcare system, while insufficient vaccines are resulting in the re-emergence of diseases that had previously been practically eradicated.
Public services will remain under strain from a lack of resources
The old-age dependency ratio will remain low by developed-country standards but, in the context of volatile public finances, population ageing will place growing pressure on the heavily burdened social security system. Public hospitals will continue to suffer from crumbling infrastructure, and lack of supplies (including medicines) and equipment. The latter are mainly imported, or assembled from imported parts, and supplies have fallen victim to a lack of US dollars. Hospital building and rebuilding programmes have been a failure, owing to mismanagement of funds and shortages of building materials. Even a parallel welfare system, the Sistema Nacional de Misiones, is struggling to function as the government makes cuts and inflation erodes purchasing power. Overall, the provision and quality of public healthcare and education services is therefore expected to deteriorate further. This will also reflect long-running problems including a pronounced deficit of technical and basic skills, and the continued emigration of professionals, particularly doctors and nurses.

Although Venezuela appears to be a middle-income country, a sharply overvalued exchange rate artificially inflates US dollar income measurements. In dollar terms, and using a weighted average of the country's official exchange rates, we estimate that GDP per head stood at US$16,013 in 2017. Estimates using purchasing power parity (PPP) give a lower figure of US$12,558. Using the black-market exchange rate, at over BsF100,000:US$1 in late 2017, compared with the official weighted average of BsF843:US$1), these calculations would result in a significantly lower GDP per head figures. Given the country's ongoing recession, and a partial closing of the gap within official and black-market exchange rates, we expect GDP per head and disposable incomes to fall in the medium term, before beginning to pick up in PPP terms from 2021. These forecasts are based on the benign assumption that a political transition materialises without severe economic disruption, and that growth recovers thereafter.
Several factors will restrict purchasing power, including hyperinflation, and persistently high levels of poverty and income inequality. Although national statistics show a dramatic improvement in social indicators in recent years, the data have been disputed, and independent studies have suggested that inequality has not fallen as quickly as the government indicates, and that the middle-income class has shrunk. According to the UN Human Development Programme, 6.6% of the population survived on less than US$1.25/day (in purchasing-power terms) in 2012, a higher proportion than in almost any other country in the region.
Investment potential will only be tapped after a political transition
Venezuela is a reasonably sized consumer market and has the potential to become an attractive investment location, although this will have to wait until a more market-friendly administration takes over from the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela. The country has vast reserves of natural resources (including oil, gas, coal and precious metals), an array of spectacular natural tourist attractions, relatively good physical infrastructure and a fairly favourable geographical location given its proximity to the US. However, poor economic policies have contributed to a volatile GDP profile and a deterioration of public services and human capital over the past two decades. The unattractiveness of the business environment is compounded by inadequate contract and property rights. Moreover, continued high poverty levels and a deterioration in health-care and education provision in the past three decades have contributed to an erosion of skills and productivity, which has also been exacerbated by an exodus of talented individuals to work abroad.

A weakened productive base will sustain demand for imported goods
In common with the rest of the Latin American region, spending on food, beverages and tobacco accounts for the largest share of total consumer expenditure, and this will remain the case throughout the forecast period. Sharp growth in mobile-telephone usage and an underdeveloped urban public transport system (which has boosted car ownership) are the main factors behind the relatively heavy weighting of expenditure on transport and communications. Most consumer goods industries will remain underdeveloped, a legacy of "Dutch disease", whereby dependence on energy exports leads to currency appreciation and therefore a lack of competitiveness in manufacturing exports, with a consequent decline of the latter sector. Furthermore, shortages of foreign exchange have led to import controls, resulting in a scarcity of consumer goods that are not produced domestically.
The scale of the country's ongoing recession will lead to major contraction in retail sales volumes throughout most of the forecast period, and only a modest improvement from 2021. Despite recent corrections to the exchange rate (and our forecast of further corrections in 2019), the bolivar will still be overvalued, so sales in US dollar terms are not an accurate indicator of consumer demand.

The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term outlook is based upon a transition to a new government (in 2019) that pursues sounder policies and improves the business environment. However, despite the prospects of a more market-friendly government and the gradual elimination of the country's economic distortions, long-term growth will remain underwhelming, and will continue to be subject to boom and bust cycles linked to the oil market. We therefore project that Venezuela's real GDP per head will contract by an average of 0.2% in 2018-30 (this figure is also influenced by major contractions in 2018-19). Growth will average a healthier 2.4% in 2031-50 but the country's population is unlikely to reach a high standard of living within the forecast period. Indeed, by 2050 we forecast that per head GDP at purchasing power parity will be US$35,157-a low value for a country with Venezuela's endowment of national resources. Although we expect the business environment to improve, the country's weak institutions, dependency on the extractive industry and a weak productive base will remain significant barriers to growth.
Initial conditions: After averaging growth of 10% in 2004-08, real GDP fell sharply in 2009-10. Although the economy recovered in 2011-12 on the back of aggressive fiscal spending, growth slowed sharply again in 2013, with the economy slipping into a deepening recession in late 2014. We estimate that by the time the economy returns to growth in 2021, real GDP will have halved, making the recession the country's most severe since compilation of national statistics data began. The heterodox policy framework that has been in place for over a decade has been a major factor in hampering GDP growth, while an opaque and distorted exchange-rate system has provided opportunities for corruption on a large scale, further undermining the institutional framework and maintaining income inequality. Given the sharp deterioration in conditions in recent years, there is potential for improvement in the policy and political environment in the long term under new administrations, but there is significant risk of an outright economic collapse before then (or afterwards, if the transition is particularly chaotic). In addition, institutional deterioration is very deep-rooted and will prove harder to reverse.
On a more positive note, a higher skills base and reasonably good infrastructure by regional standards provide scope for faster overall growth and a rise in personal incomes. Nevertheless, underinvestment in human capital and infrastructure is eroding these advantages and, given fiscal difficulties, this trend will take time to reverse. Successive governments have failed to take advantage of Venezuela's proximity to developed US and European markets relative to its South American neighbours, as internal geography and a lack of investment in infrastructure in the interior have limited Venezuela's chances of becoming a regional hub for transport and commerce.
Demographic trends: As in most other emerging-market countries, growth in the working-age population will slow in the long term, while rising partici-pation rates will ensure that the labour force will grow at a brisker pace. Venezuela will continue to enjoy supportive population dynamics, with the dependency ratio of old to young low by comparison to OECD levels even in 2050. Even with life expectancy growing steadily, the share of the population aged 65 and over will be only around 16% in 2050 (although rising from an estimated 6.6% in 2017), while the proportion of the population at working age will remain high, at 65%. A particular risk to productivity is the "brain drain" seen in recent years as many experienced professionals have left the country to work abroad with no guarantee of returning, even after economic conditions stabilise following a change in government.
Diversifying away from oil will be one of the key long-term challenges
External conditions: Oil, which we estimate currently accounts for some 95% of export revenue, will continue to dominate the Venezuelan economy. However, there will be an effort to diversify the productive base in the long term, given the severe consequences of the economy's dependency on oil (particularly on the external and fiscal balances). During the Hugo Chávez (1999-2013) and Nicolás Maduro eras Venezuela and its allies have taken a confrontational stance against US policy and US-led efforts at economic integration. This stance will soften once a new government is in power, which will result in an economic rapprochement with some of its faster growing neighbours, such as Colombia and Peru. It will also signal the end of programmes such as PetroCaribe, a scheme in which Venezuela provided subsidised oil to regional economies as a way of gaining international goodwill, which was financially viable only as a result of historically high oil prices. A gradual real devaluation of the exchange rate will be necessary for Venezuela to be competitive in non-commodity sectors, as will be the removal of state control over key productive sectors that have export potential. Capital control, trade restrictions and other barriers currently designed to keep foreign currency from leaking out will gradually be pared down as well, although further liberalisation of trade is unlikely to be a priority for the next government until well into the next decade. In the meantime, links with Asia will be strengthened, and the country's close relationship with China is not likely to be compromised, given that country's significant investment potential.
Institutions and policy trends: Under the assumption of a change in government that gradually ushers in improved policymaking over the long term, our long-term forecast assumes that there will be a gradual improvement to the policy environment. We assume that some of the most distortionary elements of the current policy framework, including price and exchange controls, will be scaled back gradually in the medium term, reducing the large black-market exchange-rate premium and increasing economic openness by the end of the long-term forecast period. However, the prospects for improvements in other aspects of the business environment are less encouraging, given that they will take far longer to address. For example, strengthening of the non-oil public finances will prove unfeasible until the economy is sufficiently diversified. Given that the economy will still be highly vulnerable to the fluctuations of the price of oil, the fiscal position will remain highly pro-cyclical. An overhaul of the overstaffed and inefficient bureaucracy will be difficult to achieve, even with an administration fully composed of the current opposition. This is owing both the political costs of redundancies, and the fact that many current opposition parties are ideologically inclined to have the state play a major role in the economy. Within the context of a deficient administrative framework, progress in reforming social security and labour legislation will be slow at best, as the new government will want to retain some of its powers of patronage in order to avoid a loss of support from the withdrawal of Chávez-era benefits. Endemic corruption and politicisation will be difficult to root out, even assuming other improvements in the policy environment.
The economy will remain vulnerable to external shocks and cycles
Long-term performance: Even once the most distortionary elements of current economic policy are abandoned, the deterioration of the skills base over the past decade will mean that Venezuela's potential GDP growth will have been eroded, although there is still some scope for recovery in 2021-40, when growth will average a respectable 3.5%. It will then slow down to an average of 2.7% in 2041-50. A higher trend rate of GDP growth would be possible if a significant change in the policy direction is coupled with more favourable external conditions (mainly oil prices) than currently forecast, thereby allowing for rapid and thorough implementation of much-needed structural reforms. Under our baseline scenario, however, achieving reforms beyond those necessary for a post-transition adjustment will prove very complicated. As it is, the overall economy will remain vulnerable to continuing cycles of boom and bust, with negative consequences for macroeconomic stability and growth, and constraining the prospects for catch-up with more developed economies, despite some solid projected growth late in the forecast period. The key variables to a successful turnaround will be the degree to which the economy is diversified from oil and whether the business environment improves to the point that domestic and external investment become key drivers of growth.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends
Climate change and sustainability
Venezuela is vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change owing to both geographical limitations and the government's inadequate focus on preparedness. Venezuela is deemed extremely vulnerable to climate change given its population distribution along coastal lines on unstable terrains. 75% of the country's population is estimated to live in the 20% of the territory facing the Caribbean sea. Given low maintenance of infrastructure and little disaster preparedness, the population centres there are exposed to torrential rains, mudslides and flash floods. According to a recent study by a local and internationally recognised expert, Juan Carlos Sanchez, even within established rainfall patterns, variance has resulted in the number of extreme events per year growing in the past decade. Longer-term trends in rainfall will also affect the country. A study performed by the Universidad Simón Bolívar, a well-regarded university, has concluded that rainfall in the northwest of the country could fall by 25% by 2060. This would not only cause internal migration, but also drive the country into further food insecurity (Venezuela is already heavily reliant on imports of foodstuffs). In addition, changing rain patters may disrupt hydroelectricity generation, a major problem given that this represents over 50% of the country's electricity.
The government has done little to address these challenges. Its public works programmes concentrate on traditional infrastructure projects and there is minimal focus in the way of disaster preparedness. In a recent forum with a United Nations delegation, authorities touted their plans to build apartment blocks in place of shantytowns, the logic being that concrete buildings would hold up to flooding better. There is scarce official data on carbon emissions or pollution in the country, but environmental policies are generally deemed poor by specialised observers. PDVSA, the state-owned oil firm, has been routinely accused of poor environmental protection in both its oil and gas operations.
Migration and urbanisation
Venezuela experienced rapid urbanisation through the majority of the second half of the 20th century as the country's oil wealth was developed. According to data from the World Bank, the percentage of urban population grew from 60% in 1960 to almost 90% by the late 1990s-high by global standards but in line with most large southern cone countries. Oil exports, especially at the start of this process, funded large-scale real estate developments and infrastructure works in budding urban centres, attracting prospective workers from the countryside. In addition to a growing middle class fed by spill-over from the country's oil wealth, the rural exodus towards the cities also created sprawling shantytowns across major metropolises, which-public housing programmes have been unable to eradicate. Income inequality in urban centres is especially acute, feeding crime and political tension. This is perhaps best exemplified by Caracas, the capital, where income and wealth disparities have correlated with voter preferences for the ruling PSUV and the opposition parties.
Emigration, previously a limited phenomenon, has become a major issue. No official data exist, but out of a total population of around 31m, local estimates put total emigration in the past two decades at close to 3m people, with over 1m having left in the past two years. These émigrés were initially primarily driven by political reasons, but the exodus is now also driven by criminal violence (Venezuela has one of the world's highest murder rates) and woeful economic conditions. Anecdotal evidence suggests that those leaving have been primarily young, well-trained professionals, which has harmed the economy's prospects further. Under The Economist Intelligence Unit's expectation of a political transition, some of these émigrés are expected to return; how many will and how fast remains unclear.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2013-17) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2018-22). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2013-17. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2018-22 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2013-17 ranges are then used to derive 2018-22 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2018-22, not to the likely situation in 2022 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2015 or 2020). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Argentina--highlights: Political outlook
The ruling centre-right Cambiemos coalition government is under increasing political pressure amid recent currency volatility, but will be hoping to get its policy agenda back on track in time for the presidential election, when the president, Mauricio Macri, will seek a second term. However, the opposition will increasingly obstruct policy. Cambiemos lacks a congressional majority, meaning that the administration has to negotiate support for its legislative agenda on an ad hoc basis with various factions of Argentina's dominant Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party). In this environment, the opposition will begin manoeuvring for position ahead of the presidential election, and the government will now struggle to push its agenda through. On our current assumption that Mr Macri wins a second term in 2019, we expect that the pace of reform will increase, and will start to yield results more clearly late on in our five-year 2018-22 forecast period.

Argentina's position in our business environment ranking improves substantially between the historical and forecast periods. The weak historical ranking reflects the legacy of expansionary and distortionary macroeconomic policies, and a deterioration in the legal and regulatory framework. The Macri administration will continue to iron out distortions, which, although contri-buting to still-high inflation in the short term, will improve the business environ-ment. However, depending on the extent of public opposition and economic volatility, there is a risk that the government may be forced to backpedal, implying that implementation would be less successful than we currently assume.

Fiscal tightening, combined with severe drought, will lead to a deceleration of GDP growth towards 2% in 2018. Thereafter, however, we expect a moderate pick-up in 2019-22 towards 3% on average. There are downside risks to our GDP forecasts, as attempts by the government to engineer a relatively smooth adjustment to a lower-inflation environment could prove extremely challenging, keeping both consumption and investment below potential. There is also some upside risk, however, as investment could take off beyond expectations once the gains from macro-economic adjustment materialise and assuming that efforts to restore confidence in the rule of law make progress. But even in this scenario, in the absence of deeper structural reform than we currently envisage, the potential growth rate will remain closer to 3% than to 4%.

Population growth has slowed in recent decades and is expected to remain below the Latin American average, although it will be outpaced by growth in the labour force in the outlook period. An ageing population will place a heavy demand on healthcare services, which have deteriorated in recent years. The effects of this decline will be lasting, but relatively high skills levels mean that the stock of human capital will, nonetheless, remain a source of compara-tive advantage, although improvements in some other Latin American countries will narrow the gap between Argentina and much of the rest of the region.

Argentina's wealth of natural resources, a large domestic market with high per-head incomes relative to much of the rest of the region, and proximity and preferential access to the large Brazilian market represent attractive long-term opportunities for foreign investors (assuming that the Brazilian economy recovers gradually). However, economic adjustments to rein in inflation will deter investment in the very short term, at least as businesses wait on the sidelines while Mr Macri pushes through the necessary-but politically and socially difficult-adjustments.

Our forecast for annual average GDP growth of 2.8% in 2018-50 assumes that the contribution of capital to growth will be firm in the first part of the forecast period, before tapering off somewhat. We also assume that as growth in the working-age population slows, the increase in the availability of labour will slow, meaning that growth will become more dependent on productivity gains. To the extent that they are achieved, these gains are likely to be made via technology transfer and higher foreign invest-ment. Although Argentina's abundant natural resources and relatively strong skills base represent solid economic potential, the country will struggle to achieve the productivity gains needed to converge with developed-market income levels.

Background: Democracy was restored to Argentina in 1983, after 50 years of instability and military regimes. Economic liberalisation in the 1990s drove firm growth, but an inflexible exchange-rate mechanism and fail-ure to deepen structural reform left the economy vulnerable to shocks, contributing to the collapse in 2001 of Fernando de la Rúa's centre-left government. An interim government took power until Néstor Kirchner of the Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party) began a term in 2003. He presided over an economic rebound, which enabled his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, to win the presidency in 2007 and secure re-election in 2011. Economic policy mismanage-ment drove a change of government in 2015, with a centre-right candidate, Mauricio Macri, taking office in December 2015.
Political structure: A strong presidential system is in theory checked by a bicameral Congress, comprising a 257-member Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and a 72-member Senate (the upper house); in practice, however, the presidency dominates. The presidential term is four years. There are 23 provinces and the Buenos Aires federal district, each with its own government.
Policy issues: Pro-cyclical expansionary policies and the commodity supercycle contributed to GDP growth of an annual average of 6.6% in 2005-11. But expansionary policy also produced significant imbalances in the economy in the form of double-digit inflation, real peso appreciation and a deterioration of the balance of payments. Amid currency pressures, the Fernández government resorted to controls and ad hoc interventionism, to the detriment of the business environment. These policies did not reduce devaluation speculation, and left the economy extremely vulnerable to currency crisis. Macroeconomic adjustments to reduce economic distortions and set the economy on a more solid long-term footing are taking place under Mr Macri; these include peso devaluation in 2015, fiscal and monetary tightening, and, more recently, reforms to boost domestic supply.
Taxation: The value-added tax (VAT) rate is 21%, although VAT on some goods and services is charged at a lower rate of 10.5%, and some services are taxed at a higher rate of 27%. Corporate income tax is levied at 35%, and personal income tax at progressive rates between 9% and 35%. Under a tax reform approved at end-2017, the corporate income tax rate will fall to 30% in 2019 and 25% in 2021. There is a 0.6% tax on financial transactions (deposits and withdrawals).
Foreign trade: The current account moved from surplus to deficit in 2010. By 2016 the deficit had widened to 2.7% of GDP.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
Present government: The president, Mauricio Macri, took office on December 10th 2015 for a four-year term ending in December 2019. Mr Macri was elected on the ticket of the Cambiemos electoral alliance. This alliance includes Mr Macri's own party, the centre-right Propuesta Repúblicana (Pro), along with the centrist Unión Cívica Radical and the smaller left-wing Coalición Cívica. Mr Macri's party is in a minority both in the Senate (the upper house of Congress) and the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house). Following a good performance in mid-term elections in October 2017, Cambiemos has a plurality of seats in the lower house. In the Senate, various moderate factions of the Partido Justicialista (the Peronist party) hold the largest number of seats, followed by Cambiemos. The government relies on support from moderate Peronists to pass legislation.

Political outlook: Political stability
Argentina has been hit hard by an emerging market sell-off in recent weeks, and although market turbulence is likely to subside, recent developments will have lasting political consequences for the government, which has been obliged to seek an IMF lending agreement to help ease market concerns and end a damaging peso run. The Fund is likely to be supportive of Argentina, and The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect dramatic changes in the course of economic policy, which is already geared towards macroeconomic and microeconomic reforms to restore stability and promote more solid, stable economic growth. The problem for the president, Mauricio Macri, and his ruling centre-right Cambiemos coalition, is that the Fund has a very poor reputation in Argentina, reflecting its role before and after the country's deep economic crisis of 2001-02. Argentina's return to the Fund will, therefore, weigh on the government's approval ratings, and will embolden the opposition, with less than 18 months to go until the presidential election.
The government will be hoping to get its policy agenda back on track in time for the presidential election, when Mr Macri will seek a second term. However, the opposition will be smelling blood and will increasingly obstruct policy. Cambiemos lacks a congressional majority, meaning that the administration has to negotiate support for its legislative agenda on an ad hoc basis with various factions of the Partido Justicialista (PJ, the Peronist party). The PJ, which dominated politics for decades before Mr Macri's election victory in 2015, is struggling to regroup from that defeat and is beset by internal divisions. The party is currently split between a left-wing, populist faction and a centrist faction that, as yet, has no single, clear leader. The PJ's divisions have until now worked in the government's favour, allowing the government to press on with its legislative agenda with the support of moderate Peronists. Moreover, until now Mr Macri has remained relatively popular, with voters giving him the benefit of the doubt on the need for economic adjustment. But patience is wearing thin.
In this environment, the opposition will begin manoeuvring for position ahead of the presidential election, and the government will now struggle to push its agenda through. In the aftermath of its strong performance in the October 2017 mid-terms, the government moved quickly to pass reforms to the tax system, pensions and competition policy (and in May it managed to pass capital market reforms). But in coming months, major reforms will be on hold, and opposition challenges to policy initiatives that are presented will increase. All this means that much-needed reforms to increase the flexibility of labour markets, improve the effective-ness of the judiciary, and enhance investor confidence in institutions and contract rights will be on the back burner. On our current assumption that Mr Macri wins a second term in 2019, we expect that improvements in these areas will start to yield results more clearly late on in our five-year forecast period.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
A concentration of power in the executive helps to speed progress on the government agenda, but results in a lack of transparency in decision making. The trend towards a concentration of power in the executive has occurred ever since the 2001-02 economic crisis, at which point extraordinary powers were given to the president to expedite policymaking. Mr Macri has periodically used decree powers to push through policy measures and political appointments, particularly when Congress is in recess. Like his predecessors, the president also relies on transfers to the provinces to secure the support of powerful regional governors for his agenda. To a significant extent, governors control the voting positions of senators in their provinces.
Although Mr Macri may be more likely to pursue them than his predecessor, reforms that would successfully address longstanding institutional weaknesses and strengthen the bureaucracy will prove politically difficult. The permanent state bureaucracy is made up mainly of low-paid clerical jobs. The professionals responsible for designing and implementing policy are appointed on short-term contracts, which are renewed with each change of government (or even minister).
Reforms to improve the legal system are required
Reforms are required to improve the legal system, which has for decades been plagued by corruption and inefficiency. Under the presidency of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-15), the courts resisted pressure to side with the government; the Supreme Court ultimately declared that a legal reform threatening judicial independence was unconstitutional, ensuring that the law (which had been passed by a razor-thin margin in Congress) did not come into effect. The presence of a non-Peronist executive provides some opportunity for a new judicial reform proposal that addresses the problems of corruption and inefficiency in the judiciary (there has been a historic tendency for executive-branch overreach among Peronists). Significantly, upon taking office Mr Macri quickly filled two vacant seats on the Supreme Court with candidates viewed as highly qualified and unbiased. However, we are not optimistic about significant reform measures being taken in the short term, given Mr Macri's minority position in Congress. Without a strengthening of the legal system, it will be difficult to address the problem of corruption in government. A number of investigations into members of the Fernández government are under way, but voters have complained of a lack of convictions.
Political outlook: Election watch
The next presidential election is due in October 2019. Notwithstanding his current difficulties, we still currently assume that Mr Macri will win a second four-year term, based on our assumption of moderate GDP growth and substantial reduction of inflation by then. There are large, and growing, risks to this forecast. Reflecting the difficulties faced by minority governments in Argentina, no non-Peronist government has won a second consecutive term since the end of the military dictatorship in the 1980s. The emergence of a strong challenger from the Peronist party is therefore likely (though it is as yet unclear who this will be), and the election will be closely fought.
Political outlook: International relations
Reflecting efforts by the Macri government to repair relations with trade and investment partners in the region and elsewhere, and we expect relations with key partners to remain strong. The country took over the rotating presidency of the G20 in December 2017, and is pursuing an agenda centred on the future of jobs, infrastructure and food security. The government is keen to seek trade deals under the auspices of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union). The problem for Argentina and its Mercosur partners is that, just as the grouping has started to reverse its own protectionist tendencies, anti-globalisation sentiment has grown in the OECD. However, Mr Macri is continuing to seek support for an EU-Mercosur trade deal from his counterparts in Europe, and negotiations are continuing. Our forecasts do not currently assume a successful conclusion of free-trade talks with the EU, but there is some upside risk to this forecast.

The Economist Intelligence Unit's global business rankings measure the quality and attractiveness of the investment environment in 82 of the world's largest economies, including 12 in Latin America. Argentina makes a large improve-ment in the overall rankings between the historical (2013-17) and forecast (2018-22) periods. Partly, Argentina's improvement is a legacy of a change of govern-ment at the end of 2015, which saw a change in the policy mix away from expansionary and distortionary macro-economic policies, along with efforts to improve a weak legal and regulatory framework, and promote trade and invest-ment. The president, Mauricio Macri, has made significant strides in rolling back the distortions that characterised the previous administration's tenure, resulting in a noticeable improvement in the investment climate and prompting an improvement in the component scores across virtually every area of the business environment.
Improvement of investment environment under new government
Our forecasts currently assume that there will continue to be improvements in a number of key areas of the business environment, including policy towards private enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, and financing. To Argentina's benefit, it already scores highly in a number of categories in which improvements are generally difficult and take longer to bear fruit, such as infrastructure and market opportunities. The only area in which we expect to see a deterioration (albeit marginal) is the labour market, as it will prove politically very difficult to advance controversial reforms in this area, and labour costs will remain high. We currently expect an improvement in the macroeconomic environment, but acknowledge downside risks to this forecast related to recent volatility.

Business environment outlook: Argentina's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: The administration of Mauricio Macri works to address key weaknesses, including weak competition policy, the heavy burden of red tape and restrictive price controls.
2020-22: Continued work to build faith in legal and regulatory frameworks. State participation in key sectors continues.
Policy toward foreign investment
2018-19: Proactive, welcoming approach to foreign investment. Attempts to resolve outstanding disputes with creditors.
2020-22: Foreign direct investment is welcome. Improvement made in investment dispute settlement and availability of investment-protection schemes.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Any remaining foreign-exchange controls are likely to be removed. Continued efforts to improve the workings of Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union) and develop closer relations with the Pacific Alliance, comprising Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.
2020-22: Possibility that new free-trade agreements are signed.
Taxes
2018-19: Further gradual reductions of export taxes to encourage domestic supply. Tax reforms to promote investment and reduce tax pressure.
2020-22: Comprehensive tax reform to improve federal-provincial revenue sharing a possibility, but obstacles to reform persist. System remains complex, despite recent reforms.
Financing
2018-19: Banking penetration remains weak and long-term credit restricted, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, owing to weak long-term deposit base.
2020-22: Non-bank financing grows, but is constrained by a relatively small pool of institutional investors.
The labour market
2018-19: Tension with unions, owing to inflation. Political and bargaining power of unions remains strong.
2020-22: Limited progress on labour reform. Continued potential for conflicts with unions. Some skills shortages.
Infrastructure
2018-19: The Macri administration continues to improve contract rights and deficient regulatory regimes.
2020-22: Some public and private investment set to improve energy supply and upgrade export infrastructure, but the risk of energy shortages will persist as demand grows.
Technological readiness
2018-19: Quality of e-commerce business environment good. Upgrade of 4G capabilities.
2020-22: More progress on increasing scope of e-government as part of process to reduce red tape. Increase in research and development spending as percentage of GDP, but still relatively low compared with more developed markets.

Macroeconomic environment will improve sharply during the forecast period
Despite a forecast improvement in the score for Argentina's macroeconomic environment between the historical and forecast period, the country's global ranking only registers a relatively small improvement (remaining one of the weakest among the 82 countries covered in the business environment ranking-BER-model), while the regional ranking remains unchanged (Argentina places 11th, ahead of only Venezuela). The macro-economic environ-ment is forecast to improve during 2018-22, but, by regional and economic comparison, distortions, in the form of high inflation, relatively low reserves coverage ratios, and a large current-account deficit, will remain high. Indeed, of all of the areas covered by our BER model, Argentina's ranking in this category is the worst.
The main area of the macroeconomic environment that registers a notable improvement in the forecast period is the quality of policymaking, as Mr Macri's policy stance is much more investor-friendly than that of his predecessor, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-15). However, progress in addressing the distortions put in place by Ms Fernández is proving gradual, with the consequences of still-high levels of inflation and a still-large fiscal deficit taking their toll on the macroeconomy (as well as on the business environment more broadly). Although we do expect progress over the course of 2018-22, with fiscal tightening helping to reduce the deficit, disinflation taking hold and the external position becoming more sustainable, the pace of improvement will be relatively gradual. This will not only hamper medium-term growth potential, but will also sustain the economy's vulnerability to a deterioration in external or domestic conditions.

The economy will benefit from the return to a market-friendly policy stance
Argentina's score and ranking for private enterprise and competition improves substantially for the 2018-22 forecast period under our assumption that the Macri government will continue to introduce measures that actively encourage private investment and promote competition. The Fernández government had a track record of arbitrary decision-making that was often detrimental to the private sector, eroding confidence in the legal framework, hampering the freedom of businesses to compete and giving rise to allegations of crony capitalism. During the forecast period, we expect a revamped competition commission to focus on more rapid and thorough enforcement of antitrust violations. Across the public sector, a reduction in red tape is likely; legislation reducing red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) was approved in 2017. The government will also remain committed to scaling back price controls and subsidies, although it may be forced to make significant concessions to cushion the impact on consumers of what are significant adjustments. Although these efforts will be hampered by lobbying by special interest groups in the context of Argentina's long tradition of political clientelism, we expect significant improvements in all of these areas. That said, state participation in key sectors, including energy, utilities and banking, is expected to continue.
Under Ms Fernández, the Comisión Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia (CNDC, the competition authority) was a weak and ineffective body, doing little to prevent monopolistic practices or protect consumer rights. This is changing under Mr Macri. He appointed a new head of the CNDC in February 2016, Esteban Greco, who focused immediately on crafting a reform to the existing competition legislation. The reform, which was passed in December 2017, transforms the CNDC into an independent body (the Autoridad Nacional de la Competencia), tightens penalties for companies found guilty of competition-related offences, improves controls on mergers and acquisitions, and creates an under-secretariat responsible for investigation, training and education. Closer co-operation with US competition authorities to train staff on mergers and acquisitions will also raise standards in this area.
Agricultural export taxes and quotas are continuing to be scaled back. Immediately upon taking office, Mr Macri eliminated export taxes on wheat, beef and corn. He also reduced the tax on soybeans-the most important export crop-from 35% to 30% in early 2016. From January 2018 the tax has been cut by half a percentage point per month, a process that will continue until December 2019, when the tax will have fallen to 18%. There has been local pressure for the government to accelerate this process, in order to help producers who are struggling with the effects of a recent severe drought, but we expect the cuts to continue as scheduled.
The process of scaling back price controls on consumer goods will progress very slowly in the short term. Upon taking office, the government kept a price control programme, Precios Cuidados, in place, as it sought to curb the pass-through effect on inflation of currency devaluation, but it reduced the number of basic consumer items covered from 500 to 317. But since then a number of new products has been added to the list, with 436 products now covered, in response to rising inflation. Renewed efforts to reduce price controls on consumer goods are unlikely until inflation begins to subside.
There has been more progress on efforts to scale back government energy subsidies by raising electricity and natural gas tariffs. After taking office, the government introduced hefty price increases for end-users, with gas bills quadrupling for most consumers and electricity bills rising by around six-fold, despite considerable domestic opposition. In January 2017 the government announced new increases to utility rates in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area of 60-148%. This was followed by further hefty increases in December 2017, with electricity bills rising by an average 44% and natural gas tariffs by an average of 45% nationwide; similar increases were also introduced in April 2018. In total, utility rates have risen around fivefold since 2015 (from an extremely low base). Even with the increases, the government will still be shouldering a sizeable fiscal burden in terms of gas and utility subsidies. The authorities are aiming to scale back subsidies during the remainder of 2018 and 2019, with the aim of aligning domestic rates with market rates by the end of 2019. However, the continued rise in rates is generating significant public opposition, and there is a risk that this timetable may slip if inflation continues to rise in the short term. However, we believe that the government will remain committed to realigning utility tariffs. Measures to cushion the impact on low-income households are more likely than an abandonment or delay in the planned increase in rates.

Foreign investment to pick up
Argentina's score and ranking for policy towards foreign investment improve significantly between the historical and forecast period. This reflects Mr Macri's much more welcoming stance towards foreign capital and his efforts to make government policy towards foreign investment more transparent, clear and predictable. Progress on lifting energy tariffs will make foreign participation more attractive, while the sovereign's exit from default in April 2017 lifts a major constraint on foreign investment by reopening access to investment protection schemes (a key factor driving the increase in Argentina's score in this category for 2018-22). The government's more market-friendly approach means that the risk of expropriations is much lower, and government favouritism of domestic firms will be less marked. However, aside from occasional sales of some state-owned assets, we expect outright privatisation to remain off the agenda. The public still places much of the blame for the 2001-02 crisis on the privatisation process of the 1990s, in which foreign firms featured heavily.
Argentina's exit from default has facilitated access to capital markets, but the government's ambitious plans for infrastructure and housing development will still necessitate foreign participation in the context of fiscal expenditure constraints. With this in mind, a bill establishing a public-private partnership (PPP) framework for investment was signed into law in December 2016. Official estimates that it could raise potential capital inflows by US$90bn are likely to prove extremely optimistic, but the legislation will boost foreign participation in the country's infrastructure drive. Since the PPP investment framework became law, around 60 projects have been identified, with more realistic assessments of the additional investment standing at around 1% of GDP per year (around US$6.5bn) over 2018-21.
Energy policy reforms to liberalise tariffs and promote investment are likely to boost multinational interest in deals to commercialise Argentina's vast shale oil and gas reserves (the world's second-largest), particularly now that international energy prices have risen moderately from the 2015-16 lows. The Fernández government expropriated oil producer YPF in 2012 and paid heavy subsidies to suppress domestic petrol prices, with investment falling sharply as a result. Since then, the official policy stance has changed and YPF has signed a series of exploration and production (E&P) contracts with private-sector companies to develop the Vaca Muerta shale deposits in Neuquén province. The development of Vaca Muerta has been progressing slowly, because of the vast scale of the investment needed and the lack of local infrastructure, so the government is seeking to boost investment in the energy sector by developing other areas, offering significant deepwater exploration contracts in the Austral (5,000 sq km), Western Malvinas (90,000 sq km) and North Argentina (130,000 sq km) basins. The last two are generally unexplored, while the Austral Basin is known largely as an offshore gas play. It is expected that there will be at least two licensing rounds. For the first, bids will be submitted in November, with the results announced in December.

An easing of controls is well under way
Mr Macri's rapid moves to dismantle currency controls upon taking office are the main factor driving the improvement in Argentina's score and ranking in this area. Rather than a steady and gradual process, the government opted for an immediate lifting of controls and simultaneous devaluation of the peso, on the basis that this would provide clarity, transparency and a strong signal of the government's commitment to change. Most export duties were removed and the requirement for official authorisation from the tax bureau for all US dollar purchases and profit remittances was lifted. The peso has weakened considerably since then, and although the pace of depreciation has been relatively steady, there have been several periods of rapid depreciation (most recently in December 2017 and again in May 2018). However, the monetary authorities have responded with conventional tools (including sharp interest rate rises) rather than the re-imposition of new controls, which we believe is highly unlikely under the current government.
After 19 years of on-off negotiations, the prospect of a free trade agreement (FTA) between the EU and Mercosur (the Southern Cone customs union, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay-Venezuela is suspended) is growing. There have been three negotiating rounds between the EU and Mercosur so far in 2018 (in February, March and April), with officials hinting that the two sides are close to reaching a deal. There now seems to be a greater consensus on several significant obstacles that have long hampered talks-including treatment of agricultural products-and the Brazilian president, Michel Temer, has implied that the only remaining major issue to be resolved between the two sides is the treatment of trade in automobiles. Our economic forecasts do not currently assume that the FTA will be signed and implemented within the forecast period, but there is some upside risk to this assumption. Meanwhile, Mr Macri is also likely to continue to focus on expanding relations with the Pacific Alliance, a trade bloc comprising Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.

Tax reform is likely to fundamentally address long-running deficiencies
The tax system is one of the areas of the business environment in which Argentina registers the most significant improvements between the historical and forecast periods, shifting from the worst-ranked in the Latin America region to among the best. The approval of a comprehensive tax reform bill in December 2017 is the main factor explaining the improvement. During the historical period, Argentina's score in this area was dragged down by a high level of corporate tax (35%-one of the highest in the region), significant complexity (over 35 different types of tax were collected), as well as a series of distortionary taxes (including agricultural export taxes, a financial transactions tax and a gross turnover tax). The tax reform addresses many of these long-running weaknesses; we expect that it will help to create a more equitable and efficient tax system that supports investment and encourages formal employment.
The tax reform was designed to boost investment. The corporate income tax rate will be reduced from 35% to 25% over a five-year period, as long as profits are reinvested (if they are not, a 10% tax on distribution of dividends will be applied). The reform has also set a tax-free threshold for payroll tax in order to encourage formal-sector employment, also introduced gradually over the course of 2018-22. The counterpart of these tax cuts is an increase in some consumption taxes (including adjustments to excise taxes to make them more progressive) and the introduction of a new capital gains tax. The latter is set at a rate of 15% for dollar-denominated financial assets and inflation-linked assets, and falls to 5% for non-inflation-linked, peso-denominated financial assets. Financial assets include corporate and public bonds, central bank notes (Lebacs), and banks' long-term deposits. There will be a tax-free threshold of Ps52,000 (US$3,000). The government has opted to maintain the financial transactions tax (which it had initially wanted to phase out) until 2022, partly to compensate for lost revenue.
Improvements to the system of revenue-sharing with the provinces are also expected in 2018-22. Along with tax reform and the budget, Congress also passed a provincial fiscal responsibility law and so-called provincial "fiscal pact". Together, the measures will secure the commitment of the provinces to restraint in spending and tax pressure, and to the reduction of distortionary taxes. It will also put an end to lawsuits by the provinces related to the transfers of federal government revenue and lays out a series of changes to this system of transfers, called "co-participation", a reform that was attractive to provincial governors and the legislators that are influenced by them.
The Macri government has passed several tax measures to improve conditions for SMEs that have been particularly badly hit by deteriorating economic conditions. Since the start of 2017, SMEs have been exempt from the minimum notional income tax levied on companies' assets. This tax accounts for a very small share of total tax revenue (well under 1%), but is burdensome for SMEs (particularly for manufacturing companies who generally have more assets in the form of equipment than service providers), as it must be paid even in the event of losses. In addition, SMEs are now able to offset bank debit and credit tax against income tax. SMEs are also able to pay value-added tax (VAT) on sales every three months rather than monthly, which will assist with cashflow. Finally, to encourage investment, the law offsets up to 10% of new investment in capital goods and infrastructure against income tax.

Argentina's score and ranking for financing improve the most significantly of all the areas of the business environment between the historical and the forecast period. For the most part, this reflects the huge constraints to finance in place in much of the historical period, which resulted from continued sovereign default. Argentina's deal with holdout creditors and exit from default in 2016 has paved the way for much-improved access to external credit for corporate borrowers. At the same time, a combination of financial sector reforms and a gradual move towards macroeconomic stability should help to develop the availability of long-term finance domestically. That said, large foreign companies will meet much of their financing needs through external sources. Banking sector regulation and supervision are expected to improve, while financial soundness and profitability indicators will remain solid. However, some weaknesses in the system will persist: notwithstanding an improvement, financial markets will remain relatively shallow by comparison with similarly ranked peers, as will levels of banking penetration.
Argentina's particularly weak score and ranking in the historical period is explained by several factors. Apart from the fact that the sovereign remained in default, these included the nationalisation of private pension funds in 2008, which was a serious blow to the funds' growth and had a lasting impact in the following years. Argentina's private pension-fund administrators were the country's most important institutional investors and were a growing source of finance in the local capital markets. The Administración Nacional de Seguridad Social (Anses, the social security agency, which took over the nationalised pension fund assets) was able to allocate up to 50% of assets in local private companies' shares and up to 10% of assets in foreign government securities.
A capital markets reform passed in May 2018 is likely to improve financing conditions in two main ways: by facilitating access to credit for SMEs and by boosting the mortgage market. A new electronic credit invoice system will improve access to credit and also improve the risk rating of SMEs that supply big companies. The reform also establishes the conditions for the creation of a market to securitise mortgage loans, a development that will require increased supervision, particularly of inflation-indexed mortgages.

Labour market reforms are unlikely
The labour market is the only area of the business environment in which we expect a deterioration (albeit marginal) between the historical and forecast periods, with Argentina's regional ranking also slipping by two places and the global ranking falling by 13 places. The labour force is well-educated, productive and flexible. But labour costs are high by international comparison, and this issue will be resolved only slowly over the forecast period as the peso appreciation of the past decade (in real terms) is gradually unwound. At the same time, we do not expect substantial progress on labour market reform or in addressing a highly unionised labour market that produces a high incidence of strikes. In the short term, difficult economic adjustments that are contributing to a decline in real wages and a cut in purchasing power will translate into a continued high level of strikes, particularly as the government continues to rein in wage increases against the backdrop of still-high levels of inflation.
The passage of comprehensive labour reform is unlikely during 2018-22, given the recent deterioration in relations between the government and organised labour. Mr Macri has effectively shelved plans for a broad-based reform bill, instead choosing to focus on only one aspect-an amnesty for employers who register informal workers. The government is likely to submit a bill to encourage labour formalisation by forgiving fines due by employers for having informal workers, as long as they have formalised the employees' contracts. However, even by the government's estimates, the measure would be likely to lead to the incorporation of only around 200,000 of the country's 4.5m informal workers into formal labour markets (and potentially far fewer). As such, these measures are unlikely to boost Argentina's score in this area over the course of the forecast period.
Skills shortages and mismatches have become more of a problem for business in the past decade, compounded by a lack of effective training pro-grammes in both the public and private sectors. Secondary and tertiary enrolment are very high by regional standards, but educational outcomes are not as strong as would be expected given high enrolment rates, and vary widely by province. At the same time, access to job training tends to be unequal and informal. We do not expect any significant improvement in these areas during the forecast period.

More private investment will help to upgrade infrastructure
Argentina's score for infrastructure remains relatively unchanged between the historical and forecast periods, as does the country's global ranking, although its regional ranking improves markedly as other Latin American countries register notable deteriorations. The country boasts a well-developed telecommuni-cations network, as well as relatively low property rental costs. However, physical infrastructure has suffered over the past decade from a lack of investment. We currently assume that Argentina's exit from default, the passage of PPP legislation and improvements in contract rights will help to boost investment both in transport infrastructure and energy. However, such projects will take time to come on stream, explaining the fact that Argentina's score improves only modestly in 2018-22, and raising the risk that infrastructure bottlenecks will continue to hamper growth in the meantime.
The risk of energy shortages will persist in the short term at least, given long project completion times. Demand for electricity and gas has soared in the past decade, but as tariffs for residential and business consumers are lifted, demand growth is expected to slow. Argentina reached a final agreement with China in October 2017 to construct a fourth and fifth nuclear reactor in Argentina, with construction expected to begin in the second half of 2018. Aside from this, prospects are less certain. Despite Argentina's vast hydroelectric potential, no further large projects are under way. The government has undertaken auctions in the renewable sector since early 2017, under its RenovAR project, and is preparing an offshore energy auction in the conventional sector (scheduled for November 2018), but successful bids are unlikely to translate into new capacity until late in the forecast period (or even after). In the short term at least, the lack of new energy capacity coming on stream will maintain dependence on imports, and increase exposure to weather-related problems at existing hydropower facilities.
Although the mobile telecoms market has matured in recent years, there remains significant room for development in the quality and scope of mobile-telecoms services. Although substantial investments have been announced by telecoms companies, whether these materialise (thus resulting in noticeable improvements during the forecast period) will partly depend on the ability of the government to draft and pass a new communications law to improve competition and operating conditions. Despite the fact that the government is likely to encounter resistance to some of its reform proposals in other areas, telecoms reform is less controversial, and we expect progress on this issue during the forecast period. Broadband penetration is the highest in Latin America, owing to high per-head income and strong competition, which has kept subscription fees low and the quality of service high. 4G coverage, at just over 70%, is among the highest in the region.

This section, introduced as part of an upgrade to our rankings in 2018, aims to show how future-oriented the business environment is-the extent to which it is digitally connected, open to innovation and prepared for technological disruption.
Argentina registers one of its highest scores in this area of the business environment, and although it is only mid-ranked by global comparison, it is the strongest ranked in Latin America during the forecast period. High levels of mobile subscriptions and broadband penetration underpin the score, given that they are critical to driving broader technological developments including mobile apps and cloud computing, which in turn helps to drive economic growth across a variety of sectors and facilitate an increase in productivity. However, regulation and governance remain relative weak points (and are what distinguishes Argentina from higher-ranked global peers), while the backdrop of a highly distorted macroeconomic policy environment has prevented signifi-cant private investment, which has hampered research and development and the number of patent applications.
The process for applying for a patent in Argentina has traditionally been a long one, with complex procedures and administrative deficiencies contributing to large backlogs in the Instituto Nacional de la Propiedad Industrial (INPI, the national institute of industrial property). However, an agreement signed between the European Patent Office (EPO) and the INPI in February 2018 is likely to facilitate the granting of patents during the forecast period. Similar agreements that already exist between the EPO and Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Brazil have made the application process simpler and quicker, resulting in an increase in successful patent applications. Alongside collaboration with the EPO, Argentina has agreed a "Patent Prosecution Highway" with the US Patent and Trademark Office that similarly aims to expedite the review of patent applications. Argentina is also focusing on other measures, including fast-tracking applications that have already received approval in other countries, taking on more specialist staff at INPI and digitalising internal processes, in an attempt to boost efficiency.
The e-commerce environment is expected to remain strong. Online retail was quicker to develop in Argentina than in many other countries in the region, supported by an early and rapid take-up of mobile broadband. According to the Cámara Argentina de Comercio Electrónico, the e-commerce chamber, purchases via the internet grew by 52% in value terms in 2017 (a similar growth rate to 2016), reaching Ps156.3bn (US$7.8bn). Online and mobile banking is already popular and is used to conduct routine transactions, aided by well-developed mobile banking services and a modern payments system that meets international standards. Logistics is somewhat weaker, with most delivery companies failing to deliver as rapidly as in similarly ranked countries. This reflects a legacy of weak investment in physical infrastructure, which has hampered the quality of the road network and led to some port delays.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
Currency depreciation pressure amid an emerging market sell-off has intro-duced substantial political uncertainty, but we assume that major changes to economic policymaking will not take place under an IMF lending arrangement, barring a more rapid tightening of fiscal policy. The govern-ment has made progress since it came to office at the end of 2015 and began grappling with the task of restoring macroeconomic stability while improving conditions for busi-ness. But macroeconomic adjustment is clearly incomplete: inflation came in at 25.4% in March, amid continued utilities tariff rises (intended to reduce the fiscal burden of subsidies and promote investment by bringing utilities prices towards market rates), and the fiscal deficit remains substantial, at 6% of GDP in 2017.
Still-high inflation has contributed to currency over-valuation, which has in turn produced a large and growing current-account deficit. These imbalances have contributed to the sharp peso adjustment of recent weeks, and to the government's decision to seek an IMF lending deal (which the government asserts that it will treat as precautionary) to restore market confidence. An IMF stand-by arrangement (SBA) will come with conditionality, but in public comments and in its executive board assessment undertaken during Article IV consultations, the Fund has been supportive of the Macri government's policy framework, and The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect dramatic changes, although tougher, frontloaded fiscal targets do seem likely.
As under our previous assumptions, we expect that fiscal tightening, combined with a winding-down of utilities tariff adjustments and relatively tight control of nominal wage rises, will gradually reduce inflation and engender macro-economic stability over time. This will have positive implications for the external sector and growth. The biggest risks to this outlook are political, and reflect the possibility that voter (as well as business) confidence in the Macri admin-istration and the economic outlook feeds into further market volatility and economic activity. This would not only complicate the adjustment process, but also threaten our assumption of that Mr Macri will secure a second term in power, raising questions as to the future direction of economic policy under a new government.

Government debt 56.5 56.6 56.3 55.5 54.8 53.8
The government has pursued gradual fiscal tightening (so as not to thwart economic growth) but is under increasing pressure to accelerate the pace of the adjustment. In early May, amid a peso rout, the Treasury revised its primary deficit target for 2018 to 2.7% of GDP, down from 3.2% previously. Bearing in mind that the government beat its fiscal target for the first quarter of 2018 by a substantial margin, this target should not be difficult to meet, although it will require cuts to planned capital spending, which will have a knock-on impact on economic growth. Apart from capital spending, expenditure restraint will come via a phasing out of costly energy subsidies and the recent approval of a social security reform that will produce substantial savings (0.4% of GDP per year from 2018). The biggest risks to meeting the fiscal target this year centre on the government's ability to maintain public-sector wage restraint amid above-target inflation and strong public-sector union power, as well as below-target revenue, reflecting an expected deceleration of economic activity this year.

With negotiations on a formal lending arrangement with the IMF ongoing, we have made a tentative, moderate revision to our forecasts for the reduction of the primary deficit in coming years. We now expect a move back into fiscal surplus to happen slightly quicker than under the government's current plans. Capital spending is already very low as a percentage of GDP, providing increas-ingly limited room for cuts. As such, further savings will need to be made from current spending, including wages and transfers; these will be politically diffi-cult-and potentially unsustainable. On this basis, we do not expect an IMF deal to include any sharp fiscal shock; however, there is some risk to the assumption that the IMF will endorse the government's gradual adjustment policies.
The government is facing a problem with liquidity rather than solvency. Bearing in mind that a majority of the sovereign's financing needs for this year are already met, and assuming that market access improves after the latest sell-off, financing the moderate public debt ratio (which we expect to come in at 58% of GDP this year) should still be manageable. That said, unless Argentina receives and decides to draw down on IMF funds, financing costs will rise, with knock-on implications for debt interest payments and the overall fiscal deficit, which will narrow more slowly than the primary deficit.

Deposit rate (av) 19.0 21.6 12.6 6.7 4.7 4.2
The Banco Central de la República Argentina (BCRA, the central bank) has tight-ened monetary policy sharply to help stem a peso rout in early May, and will unwind its rate rises only slowly. In the space of little over a week, the bank raised the policy rate by 1,275 basis points, to 40% on May 3rd. Further currency depreciation is possible in coming days, and further rate rises remain a risk (although for now we expect rates to stay on hold). Recent sharp policy tightening will eventually restore some calm, allowing the central bank to begin to unwind its dramatic rate rise over the next few months. This process will be complicated, however, by weak confidence in the nascent inflation-targeting regime, which means that inflation expectations are not well anchored and pass through from currency depreciation into consumer prices is relatively high.
Weak confidence in the inflation target reflects several factors, but important among them is the government's own strategic error of relaxing the 2018 inflation target at the end of 2017. The government states that this change was geared at making the inflation target more realistic. It may also have been keen to address peso overvaluation by encouraging an interest-rate cut. But efforts to engineer currency depreciation this way have been anything but smooth, partly because resultant perceptions of discord between the government and the central bank have damaged domestic confidence in the government's commitment to fighting inflation.
The BCRA has been clear in its view that current price pressures are temporary, and we share this view. But in the meantime, the latest rapid slide in the currency will feed through to a spike in prices in May-June that will leave the year-end inflation target of 15% well out of reach (inflation was 25.4% in March). We do still expect monthly inflation to start to ease towards 1% on a con-sistent basis later in 2018, once the effects of currency depreciation and tariff adjustment start to fade. This should allow for gradual monetary easing, taking the nominal policy rate to slightly above 25% by year-end. Our forecasts thereafter assume moderately positive real interest rates in the medium term.

A spike in interest rates and a tightening of fiscal policy (to include real cuts in capital spending) amid currency pressures will weigh on economic activity. We have revised our forecast for real GDP growth in 2018 to 2.3%, down from 2.7% previously. Although the latest data suggest that growth remained firm in the first quarter of the year, activity will be dampened later this year, not just by tighter macroeconomic policy, but also by the effects of a severe drought, which will hit the harvest of two key crops, soya and maize. Agriculture accounts for a fairly hefty 11% of GDP, and agro-industry is also important to the economy.
For now, our view of GDP growth beyond 2018 remains broadly unchanged, although the risks to our forecasts have risen substantially. Under our benign baseline forecast, we expect growth to fluctuate around 3% 2019-22, dipping in 2020 amid a projected cyclical downturn in the US, before accelerating back above 3% in 2021-22. This projected acceleration rests on the assumption that that implementation of recently passed and ongoing structural reforms will gradually boost economic activity. There is increasing downside risk to this assumption, in the form of a weakening of consumer and business confidence, and the potential for a much more tense presidential election period in 2019.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
A severe drought will hit the soybean crop badly this year and lead to a contraction in agricultural production. But notwithstanding the poor 2018 outturn, agriculture will continue to be a key contributor to the Argentinian economy. Although it has accounted for around 10% of GDP over the past decade, and for around 20% of private employment, these figures underesti-mate its contribution, as they do not include agro-industry. Weak soft commodity prices relative to the boom years of the commodities supercycle will have some dampening impact on agriculture; however, we believe that a more important factor in the sector's growth prospects will be the easing of export taxes and quotas by the Macri administration. This follows a period of ever-tightening controls implemented by the administration of the former president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-15), to keep domestic prices low, which ultimately restricted profitability and hence output. A more stable, clear and attractive environment for agriculture producers will boost output. It will also support agro-industry (including the processing of Argentina's key crop, soybean) and bolster a manufacturing sector that is currently struggling amid still-weak demand both at home and in Brazil. We expect a mild economic recovery in Brazil in 2018-22, which will also help to produce a moderate pick-up in Argentinian manufacturing in 2018-22.
Better incentives should boost key sectors
Mining and energy are two sectors with great potential. Argentina has vast shale and gas resources, but, to date, commercialising them has proven difficult, particularly in the wake of the nationalisation of the country's largest energy company, YPF, in 2012. The Macri administration has started to tackle some of the main problems constraining investment, which, apart from a lack of confidence in the rule of law, include price controls that keep gas prices well below the international market price. In 2017 the government announced a series of measures to boost investment and domestic production, thereby reducing reliance on imports. The measures include the "flexibilisation" of labour conditions in Vaca Muerta, a 30,000-sq-km oil field located in southern Argentina that is the world's second-largest shale gas reservoir and fourth-largest shale oil reservoir. The government is also hoping to eliminate price distortions gradually, but will retain high gas prices as an incentive to investment in the medium term. In exchange, oil companies including YPF, Total (France), Pan American Energy (Argentina), Chevron (US), Shell (UK/Netherlands) and Dow (US) have agreed to invest US$5bn in Vaca Muerta in 2017. These increases in investment should see exploration and production activity in the sector rise steadily this year and in the remainder of the forecast period.
The mining sector also has substantial potential. It shares the mineral-rich southern Andes mountains with Chile, long recognised as one of the world's mining powerhouses. But mining has been slow to develop in Argentina relative to its potential, partly because international companies are put off by a patchwork of different provincial taxes and regulations, some of them restrictive; for example, various provinces ban open-cast mining. In an effort to boost investment in the sector, the federal government persuaded most provinces to agree in June 2017 to harmonise regulations, with provincial mining royalties capped at 3%. Under the deal, there will be a separate 1.5% levy for provincial infrastructure funds. At the signing ceremony Mr Macri said that mining was a "pillar of job creation" capable of creating 125,000 new jobs, and made clear that the government's position that it is possible to develop the industry and employment while protecting the environment. The government's aim is to more than double total mining investment to US$25bn over the next eight years, up from US$10bn in 2007-15.
There are reasons for optimism-not least because of growing interest in Argentina's lithium deposits at a time when global demand for the metal is rising, owing to its use in a new generation of batteries. But both mining companies and environmental groups have approached the new code with some caution, saying that there has been little consultation on it, and noting that it will need legislative approval at both federal and provincial level, a potentially lengthy process.
While noting the benefit of harmonised regulations, mining companies are particularly wary of the tax burden, on the basis that provinces currently charging lower royalties may use the new code as an excuse to raise them up to the 3% ceiling (although government officials have claimed that there will be no changes in royalties on existing mines). Mining companies have also complained that a change in the taxable base from the total "pithead" value (before transport or transformation) to total gross sales would imply an increase in the tax burden. Despite these reservations, we believe that the new code is a positive signal for a neglected industry, and, along with rising metals prices, it will help to attract additional investment inflows and boost the sector's growth in the medium term.

The reduction of inflation will continue to be complicated in the short term by gradual increases in utilities tariffs as these are brought closer in line with market prices. On top of this, rapid recent peso depreciation, in a context of unanchored inflation expectations, will produce substantial pass-through effects, keeping inflation high in the very short term. However, assuming that macroeconomic policy remains tight (particularly under the auspices of an IMF deal), domestic demand remains subdued relative to the boom years of 2004-11, and domestic supply strengthens on the back of an improved regulatory environment for agricultural and other producers, we continue to expect gradual disinflation in the medium term. It will take quite some time, however, for inflation to fall to single-digit levels. According to our baseline forecast, this will happen towards the end of 2020.

The peso has been badly hit by a sell-off in recent weeks as investors that had previously given the administration the benefit of the doubt over its ability to reverse macroeconomic imbalances zeroed in on the country's large fiscal and current-account deficits. The latter reflects the fact that the peso is clearly overvalued, a problem that worsened last year as huge inflows of portfolio capital produced real currency appreciation. As a result, at end-2017 the real effective exchange rate was 14% stronger than the average of the previous 20 years. We believe that co-ordinated efforts by the government and the central bank to regain the confidence of investors-by tightening monetary policy sharply, revising the fiscal target and seeking the formal backing of the IMF-will be successful in preventing an uncontrolled devaluation of the peso in coming weeks. However, volatility will remain likely at least in the short term. We expect the peso to continue to depreciate in both nominal and real terms, in a development that will begin to address the problem of currency overvaluation. Under our baseline forecast, the currency will depreciate to Ps26.99:US$1 at end-2018 and Ps35.9:US$1 at end-2022. There remains a high risk, however, of much sharper currency weakening in coming months.

More front-loaded currency weakening than previously projected will provide some boost to external competitiveness, but even so, in 2018 the current-account deficit will remain large, with most of the boost to net exports of goods and services becoming evident from 2019. Even in 2022 we expect the current-account deficit to remain substantial, at 3.2% of GDP. After a period of huge inflows of portfolio capital in 2016-17, access to finance will be trickier and more costly in 2018-19; meanwhile, inflows of foreign direct investment will average an unspectacular 2.1% of GDP in 2018-22. This will be reflected in import cover, which recovered from a low of just four months to 7.6 months in 2017, but will dip back to seven months in 2018-22, even assuming that reserves recover slightly in the rest of 2018 from their current lows of around US$54bn in mid-May. Reserves are now almost US$10bn below the record high of US$64bn registered in January this year (this followed a large global bond issue).

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Argentina
Stocks and flows
The inward foreign direct investment (FDI) stock was US$77bn (12% of GDP) in 2017 and the outward stock of FDI was US$41bn (6% of GDP). Inflows of FDI to Argentina have been volatile in recent decades and have followed economic cycles of boom and bust. In the 1990s inflows to Argentina increased substantially, reaching 3.7% of GDP in the second half of the decade, reflecting a privatisation programme and acquisitions of domestic private firms. This was followed by a collapse in inward FDI to 1.4% of GDP in 2001-03, reflecting Argentina's default on its foreign debt in 2001 and a subsequent deep recession. Devaluation stimulated a rapid recovery of inward FDI in subsequent years, with inflows averaging 3.7% of GDP in 2003-08. Since then, however, FDI inflows have weakened, from 3% of GDP in 2008 to an annual average 1.8% of GDP in 2009-15. Since Mauricio Macri became president in December 2015, the government has worked to address concerns about the strength and predictability of the legal and regulatory environment. For now, however, inward FDI remains subdued (at 1.9% of GDP in 2017), amid investor concerns over the long-term sustainability of recent improvements to contract rights and rule of law.
Origin and distribution
US firms account for a quarter of the stock of FDI, followed by Spanish firms (16%), and Dutch firms (11%). Chilean, Brazilian and Uruguayan companies account for around 5% each. Spanish firms have invested in privatised utilities, banking and energy. European firms in the utilities and banking sectors were hit hard by the 2001-02 crisis. As many companies disinvested after the crisis, firms from Brazil, Mexico and Chile bought up cheap assets. In 2015 the largest foreign direct investor in Argentina, by some distance, was the US, followed by Spain. The potential for an influx of Chinese FDI, focused in particular in agri-business, is substantial. However, the latest local-source data on FDI inflows into Argentina by country show that, in 2016, only 2% of FDI flows came from China (with the main flows of FDI coming again from the US and the EU, particularly Spain).
Determinants
FDI into Argentina is quite broadly spread; oil accounts for 20% of the stock, followed by chemicals, the automotive sector, metal minerals, the financial sector and telecommunications, although in the past decade almost half of FDI inflows have gone into manufacturing. Historically, Argentina has attracted investors hoping to take advantage of a relatively affluent and protected domestic market. During the 1990s, and as a result of rapid trade liberalisation, domestic market-seeking investment focused on sectors that showed comparative (or even absolute) advantages or were naturally protected from foreign competition (non-tradeable services, such as utilities). Efficiency-seeking investments have been less common, and have been mainly limited to the automotive industry, where government incentives have been in place for over a decade. Recent FDI in services (including information technology-IT) has been attracted by Argentina's skilled workforce and relatively low wages.
Impact
The presence of foreign subsidiaries has brought positive spillovers (both within and across industries) in manufacturing, but only in sectors where domestic firms have proven sufficiently adaptable. In other cases, increased competition from foreign investors, or a preference on the part of the latter for foreign suppliers, has damaged local firms. Telecoms is one example of a sector where the quality of service and technology has been transformed by foreign investment. Foreign investors own most of the privatised utilities. After the 2001-02 maxi-devaluation, which in effect broke the terms of foreign investors' contracts (and after the government declined to renegotiate), investment declined. The contribution of foreign firms to local research and development activities has been limited, as technical progress has been mainly embodied by imported capital goods and turnkey plants. Foreign firms account for a large share of Argentina's exports.
Potential
The major attractions for FDI will be a growing and relatively high-income domestic market, strong natural-resource endowments and, to a lesser extent, Argentina's potential as a manufacturing base. A relatively large pool of skilled human capital and a large stock of natural resources constitute Argentina's long-term advantages. Argentina's exit from default in 2016 will also act as a spur to FDI inflows, by facilitating investor access to investment guarantees and trade finance, which has until recently been lacking.

Population growth will remain slow
Population growth has slowed in recent decades and is expected to remain below the Latin American average. Owing to a relatively low birth rate, the percentage of the population aged 14 or under is low by Latin American standards, and is falling. A declining gross birth rate and longer life expectancy also account for the high and rising share of the population aged 65 years and over, although, at just over 11%, this is still below that of OECD countries, where shares above 15% are the norm. Even so, the ageing population places increasing demand on Argentina's healthcare services, which have deteriorated signifi-cantly in recent years.
The forecast rise in the economically active portion of the population is chiefly the result of an expected increase in the female participation rate. The latter was 55% of the working-age female population in 2017, up from 51% in 1990 but still below a total labour force participation rate of 68% (and below the OECD average female participation rate of 63%), and can be expected to rise in the forecast period. Although the gross birth rate is forecast to fall over the next decade, the gross mortality rate is expected to stay broadly constant as the ageing of the population offsets improvements in healthcare conditions. Argentina has in the past been the recipient of much inward migration (an estimated 85% of the population is of European descent) and has established quite a flexible approach to immigration. Although outward migration from countries such as Venezuela and Haiti in recent years has caused some political tension in other countries in Latin America, such as neighbouring Chile, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Argentina's policy in this area to remain relatively flexible in the forecast period, enabling economic sectors such as agriculture and construction to continue to benefit from immigrant labour. Our positive medium-term economic forecasts for Argentina suggest that inward migration could pick up in the forecast period, following a period of substantial outward migration in recent decades. Partly owing to strong ties to Europe, 600,000 Argentinians are estimated to live abroad. Around one-third of these emigrated in the years immediately follow-ing the 2001-02 economic crisis. These newer emigrants are mainly middle-class young people who have moved to Spain, Italy and the US, many of whom benefit from dual Italian or Spanish citizenship.
An urban population with marked regional disparities
The population is highly urbanised. More than 90% of the country's population is concentrated in urban centres-one of the highest ratios in the world. The Buenos Aires metropolitan area contains almost one-third of the national population; when the hinterland of Buenos Aires (the pampas) is included, the proportion rises to two-thirds. Overall, population density is low, at 13 inhabitants per sq km (around one-third of the Latin American average), although this aggregate figure masks wide regional disparities: in the capital there are 13,679 inhabitants per sq km, whereas in the southern provinces of Santa Cruz and Chubut population density is just 0.8 and 1.8 inhabitants per sq km respectively. Most measures of social and economic development show marked disparities between rural and urban areas, with per-head incomes and healthcare and education indicators much better in the Buenos Aires area than elsewhere.
Argentina's lead in regional healthcare and education standards will erode
Although Argentina's healthcare indicators still compare favourably with those of most of its neighbours, social conditions worsened markedly during the 1998-2002 recession, and in many areas problems have persisted ever since, suggesting that expenditure has become inefficient. The healthcare and education systems are in urgent need of reform. Even so, a high level of educational attainment by regional standards means that the stock of human capital will remain a source of comparative strength, although improvements in some other Latin American countries will close the gap within the region.

Argentina's wealth of natural resources, large domestic market (with high per-head incomes relative to much of the rest of the region), and proximity and preferential access to the large Brazilian market represent attractive long-term opportunities for foreign investors. On top of this, The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecast of a shift to moderate GDP growth rates of an annual average 2.9% in 2018-22, and an improvement in the environment for business, suggests an increase in domestic market opportunities in the medium term.
Some improvement in purchasing power expected
Argentina is a middle-income country with one of the highest levels of GDP per head in the region-US$22,167 at purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates in 2017. Demographics are generally supportive of growth: the population is estimated at around 44m (the fourth-largest in Latin America), and is reasonably young, albeit not as young as that of most other countries in the region. Moreover, urbanisation is high, at more than 90% of the population. However, as in much of the region, income inequality and poverty remain high. According to recently released data from INDEC, the national statistics institute, the poverty rate came in at 25.7% in the second half of 2017. The extreme poverty rate was 4.8%. Although this represents a clear improvement on 2016, when the economy was in recession, the poverty rate is clearly still high. There are significant geographical disparities, with poverty rates highest outside of the capital, Buenos Aires. By national comparison, the poverty rate was highest in the north-east region, at 33.2% in the second half of 2017. In Greater Buenos Aires province, which encircles but does not include the capital city, the poverty rate was also high, at 25.5%, probably reflecting the impact of a steep decline in manufacturing in the province, which has only recently begun to ease. By contrast, the poverty rate was just 9% in the capital itself.
A full analysis of the poverty data over time is complicated by a lack of historical data. A deterioration of statistical quality during the previous administration led to unreliable poverty statistics; in the latter years of the previous administration, INDEC stopped publishing poverty statistics altogether. Under new leadership, INDEC began publishing poverty data in mid-2016, using new methodology that is not comparable with the discredited historical data. However, the mid-2016 INDEC data are similar to figures published by the Centro de Estudios Distributivos Laborales y Sociales (Cedlas), a social policy research institute at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata. According to Cedlas, the poverty rate is roughly similar to data from the first half of 2011, implying that there was no progress on poverty reduction between 2011 and 2016. In the medium term, lower inflation rates and steady economic growth should help to reduce poverty through spillover effects. In the meantime, however, poor social conditions will contribute to insecurity and social unrest.

A long-term shift in consumer attitudes was brought about by the economic crisis of 2001-02, which changed patterns of goods consumption markedly. A shift towards cheaper brands and lower-cost, high-volume outlets was not reversed even during the boom years of 2004-07. However, we expect the proportion of income spent on food, beverages and tobacco to fall gradually in the forecast period, and for the proportion of consumer spending on hotels and restaurants, healthcare, leisure and education to grow. This assumes growth in purchasing power as real disposable incomes rise over the course of the forecast period, driven by growth in employment, income redistribution via Argentina's relatively new conditional cash transfer schemes, and greater efforts at financial inclusion, which suggest a steady increase in access to bank credit during the forecast period. One difference between Argentina and the rest of the region will be the age of the population. Argentina's population will remain markedly older; just over 11% were aged 65 years and over in 2017. This will affect consumption patterns, notably pushing up overall expenditure on healthcare.

Abundant natural resources and a skilled labour force underpin potential
Argentina has historically been susceptible to cycles of boom and bust, reflecting both a vulnerability to external conditions and domestic policy challenges. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecast rests on the assumption that Argentina will adopt a more sustainable economic model that reduces fiscal and external imbalances, allowing the economy to grow by an average of 2.8% in 2017-50.
Initial conditions: Argentina's GDP per head of US$14,398 in 2017 (US$22,167 at purchasing power parity) is one of the highest in the region. However, as it is still only one-third of the US figure, there is clearly potential for Argentina to catch up to developed-country levels. The internal market is relatively large and, although the territory is extensive, there are few internal geographical obstacles, although Argentina is distant from developed-country markets and high transport costs will place an extra burden on exporters. For a decade after the 2001 maxi-devaluation, labour was cheaper than during the 1990s, but the gains from devaluation had been eliminated by 2012 amid high inflation and sustained real wage growth. Despite two decades of gradual de-industrial-isation, Argentina retains a solid skilled labour base, and the capacity to carry out high-level research and development. It will attract manufacturing invest-ment, but its competitiveness as a global manufacturing centre will lag behind Asian rivals. Argentina has strong comparative advantages in agriculture, although, as a commodity producer, it will face more volatile terms of trade than Asian competitors. This means that growth is likely to be uneven.
Demographic trends: Argentina shares demographic as well as cultural features with Europe. The average age of the population is higher than in most of the rest of the region and population growth both in percentage and absolute terms is expected to be slightly lower. We expect population growth of 0.6% per year in 2017-50, less than half the average recorded in 1980-2000. At present, the working-age population is still growing faster than the overall population, but we expect this trend to change from around 2030. Although labour force participation rates will continue to rise gradually towards OECD levels, from an estimated 64% in 2020, growth in the labour force will slow as a result. Particularly towards the end of the long-term forecast period, the contribution of labour to GDP will therefore be weaker.
The population is more urbanised and better provided with healthcare than in other Latin American countries, leading to a life expectancy of around 76 years, similar to that of many developed countries. Given the existence of the welfare state and the severe weakening of the finances of the state and private pensions systems in the past two decades, the growing elderly population will increasingly generate strains on the public finances.
External conditions: Growth-determining factors exogenous to Argentina will include the level of developed-country interest rates (in the past this has been strongly correlated with the volume of capital flows into Latin America and has had a major impact on growth) and commodity prices. Argentina will remain highly dependent on income from exports of agricultural commodities to provide an investible surplus for deployment elsewhere in the economy. Restricted access to finance since the 2001 default has raised the cost of capital in the past decade by forcing reliance on financing from the shallow, more expensive domestic market. However, Argentina's exit from default in April 2016 implies improved access to international capital markets to facilitate stronger growth in investment, particularly in agriculture, energy and infrastructure.
Institutional weaknesses will constrain growth
Institutions and policy trends: Disappointing economic outcomes have been the indirect result of shortcomings in policymaking and institutions. Argentina scores moderately to poorly on measures of corruption, security and the rule of law. Our analysis suggests that an improvement in the overall institutional climate would have a significant impact on long-term growth, but institutional reforms will take a long time to bear fruit. The quality of policymaking is likely to improve more rapidly. The government of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-15) clashed with foreign investors over the terms of contracts, and oversaw a phase of ad hoc intervention in the economy. A more market-friendly administration, led by Mauricio Macri, is seeking to address these problems, and we assume that the government will succeed early on in the long-term forecast period in establishing a new framework for foreign investors in sectors such as utilities.
GDP will grow by an annual average of 2.8% in 2018-50
Long-term performance: We forecast that average annual GDP will grow by 2.8% in 2018-50, with the growth rate peaking at 3% in 2018-30, before slowing to 2.6% by 2041-50. Our forecasts assume that the contribution of capital to growth will be firm in the first part of the 2018-50 forecast period, before tapering off somewhat over the latter part of the period. We also assume that as growth in the working-age population slows, the increase in the availability of labour will slow, meaning that growth will become more dependent on productivity gains. To the extent that they are achieved, these gains are likely to be made via technology transfer and higher foreign invest-ment. Firms will increasingly look beyond national borders in order to achieve economies of scale, and this will stimulate efficiency gains. Having said this, and although Argentina's abundant natural resources and relatively strong skills base represent solid economic potential, the country will struggle to achieve the productivity gains needed to converge with developed-market income levels. This is particularly the case in the light of low levels of domestic investment in research and development, and we expect limited progress in catching up with developed country incomes, even in the long-term forecast period.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends
Climate change and sustainability
Climate change represents a risk to Argentina's long-term growth rate, most obviously through its impact on the important agriculture sector. This vulnerability has been evident this year, with severe drought expected to lead to a sharp drop in output of key crops such as soybeans and maize, with knock-on impacts on real GDP. Since it came to office in late 2015, the Macri administration has worked to develop a comprehensive climate change plan; one element of this is the increased use of renewable energy, including hydroelectric, wind and solar power. Despite having some of Latin America's most abundant natural energy resources, less than 2% of the country's electricity currently comes from renewable energy. Under the "RenovAr" programme, Argentina is now targeting a total of 20% of electricity from renewable sources by 2025. As part of its climate change mitigation efforts, Argentina is aiming to overachieve its nationally determined contribution (NDC) originally submitted under the Paris Agreement.
The Macri administration is also in the process of developing sectoral mitigation and adaptation plans for agriculture, transport, infrastructure, forests, industry and energy, with a view to unveiling a new national climate change plan in 2019. The central government is also working on the development of a climate change map, to work with local and provincial authorities to determine geographical vulnerabilities and develop adaptation and mitigation plans, and financing, accordingly. In the Uruguay River area on the border between Argentina and Uruguay, a joint initiative between the two countries is in progress to try to increase the resilience of vulnerable coastal populations in this area. Continued progress in all these areas, both in the planning and implementation stages, will be necessary to reduce the long-term impact on growth as a result of climate change.
Technological developments
Argentina's high skills base by regional comparison will be a key factor supporting the country's ability to adapt to technological disruption in the long term. Combined with high per-head incomes, this helps to explain the country's leading position in Latin America with regard to mobile and broadband penetration, e-commerce and m-commerce, and the strength of sectors such as software development and financial technology (fintech). The capital city, Buenos Aires, is a hub for both these industries in Latin America. It is the largest exporter of software in the region, and is a large and rapidly growing centre for fintech centred on payment systems, corporate financial management, consumer and business lending, and new technologies for existing financial institutions
The e-commerce environment is expected to remain strong, and m-commerce will grow, supported by high penetration of mobile broadband. Online retail has been quicker to develop than in many other countries in the region, and is still growing rapidly (by over 52% in 2017). Online and mobile banking is already popular, and is used by customers to conduct routine transactions, aided by well-developed mobile banking services and a modern payments system that meets international standards.
Regulation and governance remain relative weak points, while a backdrop of still-high inflation and macroeconomic distortions will in the short term continue to deter significant private (including foreign investment), to the detriment of research and development, and the number of patent applications. Recent reforms to simplify patent applications should, however, produce improvements going forward.
A continuing weakness that shows fewer sign of progress as yet is logistics, with most delivery companies failing to deliver as rapidly as is the case in similarly ranked countries. This reflects a legacy of weak investment in physical infrastructure, which has hampered the quality of the road network and led to some port delays. We assume better progress in this area in the long term, which will be necessary to insert Argentina into global value chains, and allow for "leapfrogging" to tilt industrial production more rapidly towards high-tech, high-value-added products.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2013-17) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2018-22). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2013-17. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2018-22 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2013-17 ranges are then used to derive 2018-22 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2018-22, not to the likely situation in 2022 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2015 or 2020). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: Germany--highlights: Political outlook
Germany will be governed by a grand coalition comprising the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) until the next election in 2021. The government will have a smaller majority than in its previous term and will be significantly more fractious. The SPD will be more vocal in order to differentiate itself from the CDU, and possible successors to Angela Merkel, who has held the position of chancellor since 2005, will jockey for position within the CDU. The inclusion of a far-right populist party in the Bundestag (the lower house of parliament), the Alternative for Germany (AfD), for the first time in decades will also increase political instability.

Germany's score in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environ-ment rankings improves slightly between the historical period and the forecast period, mainly owing to the better macroeconomic environment. However, faster improvements elsewhere mean that the country slips in the global and regional rankings. The main strengths of the business environment are political stability, a highly skilled labour force, openness to trade and investment, and well-developed (if ageing) infrastructure. A strong research and innovation fram-ework is another advantage. Weaknesses include a high tax burden on labour income and on companies, alongside high administrative costs. Germany's open economy is also exposed to a slowdown in global trade flows. The economy is relatively well-prepared to deal with technological changes.
Germany--highlights: Economic outlook

Real GDP growth (%) 2.5 2.3 2.0 1.7 1.7 1.6
Consumer price inflation (av, %) 1.7 1.5 1.8 1.7 1.8 1.9

We forecast average annual GDP growth of 1.9% in 2018-22, driven in large part by consumer spending, in the light of a tightening labour market, solid wage growth and low borrowing costs. Fiscal policy is likely to become slightly less restrictive (although still highly prudent) and public investment will support robust business investment. We expect substantial (if gradually declining) current-account surpluses, against a backdrop of continuing recovery across the euro zone, despite external pressure for Germany to do more to boost domestic demand. In the longer term the weak demographic outlook will weigh more heavily on economic growth. The main risks to the outlook are external, with a more protectionist global trade environment, driven mainly by tariff impositions by the US, being the most pronounced.

Working-age population growth   0.4 -0.4
Labour force growth   0.7 0.5
Germany's demographic outlook is challenging, even in a European context. Long-standing natural decline, as deaths outnumber births, combined with political constraints on net immigration mean that the population will grow only marginally over the forecast period. The working-age population will start to decline, and the average age will rise, putting pressure on the pensions and healthcare systems, and exacerbating labour shortages. The influx of migrants from the Middle East and North Africa in 2015 will have only a small influence on the demographic outlook, and successfully integrating these newcomers into the labour market will require significant policy efforts.

Household consumption per head (US$) 23,690 26,420 26,990 28,090 29,000 30,520
Germany will remain the world's fourth-largest economy at market exchange rates in 2022. Germany is the largest consumer market in Europe by population, and market opportunities will be supported by the tight labour market and solid wage growth over the forecast period. The country's changing age profile will do much to shape demand, particularly in the area of leisure services for the large retired population. The consumer market will continue to be characterised by a preference for inexpensive goods for most day-to-day needs and high-quality purchases in special circumstances.

Growth of real GDP 1.6 1.2 1.4

Over the long-term forecast period the economy's growth will be constrained by markedly poor demographics. Real GDP growth will ease from an average of 1.6% in 2018-30 to 1.2% in 2031-50, although on a per-head basis the rate of growth will remain broadly steady. Notwithstanding the demographic headwinds, Germany has many attributes that are conducive to sustainable long-term growth, including a highly skilled workforce, stable institutions and openness to innovation. It needs more reform, including of the pension system, progress on which we expect to be slow. We expect this to weigh slightly on long-term economic performance.

Background: The modern German state was founded in 1870. After the second world war (1939-45) Germany was divided into two parts: a liberal parliamentary democracy in the west and a totalitarian communist regime in the east. On October 3rd 1990, after the end of the Soviet Union's hegemony in central and eastern Europe, Germany was reunified.
Political structure: Germany is a federation of 16 states, or Länder, each of which has its own constitution, government and parliament. The states are primarily responsible for policing and education. The federal parliament comprises the directly elected Bundestag (the lower house) and the Bundesrat (the upper house) of representatives of the state governments. The federal chancellor, the head of the executive, is elected by the Bundestag and can be brought down only by the election of a successor. A grand coalition comprising the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) governed from 2013 to 2017. Coalition talks following the 2017 election were lengthy, but eventually resulted in another grand coalition, which took office in March 2018.
Policy issues: Internationally, the government's agenda will include the Brexit negotiations between the EU and the UK; EU reform efforts, in collaboration with the French president, Emmanuel Macron; managing relations with the US president, Donald Trump, especially over trade issues; and shaping the EU's response to Russia, in the wake of the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Domestically, the government aims to ensure a sustainable medium-term budget surplus, increase investment spending, ensure continued progress on its Industry 4.0 agenda and shift away from nuclear energy.
Taxation: The federal corporation tax rate was cut from 25% to 15% in 2008. The effective corporate tax rate, including a municipal trade tax and a solidarity tax, is about 30-33%. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45%. Social security contributions are shared equally between employers and employees. The main value-added tax (VAT) rate is 19%.
Foreign trade: Export earnings picked up to US$1.4trn in 2017, from US$1.3trn in 2016. Import costs also picked up, to US$1.1trn, from US$1trn. This resulted in a rise in the goods trade surplus to US$300bn; the services deficit narrowed to US$18.4bn. The EU is still the largest single goods export market for Germany, but it has been more successful than most in diversifying its markets and selling into fast-growing emerging markets over the past decade.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance
Germany is a federal democracy, with major powers delegated to the 16 states (Länder). In March 2018 the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) reformed their grand coalition following a difficult and protracted coalition-building process. The bicameral parlia-ment comprises the Bundestag (the lower house of parliament), whose members are elected on a system of modified proportional representation, and the Bundesrat (the upper house), which consists of representatives of the 16 state govern-ments. The coalition has a majority in the Bundestag but not in the Bundesrat.

a Before the 2005 election, the Party of Democratic Socialist (PDS) merged with a new group, the Election Alliance for Jobs and Social Justice (WASG). The joint party was named the Left Party. Before 2005 the results relate to the PDS alone.
Political outlook: Political stability
In the federal election in September 2017 the centre-right CDU and its smaller Bavarian sister party, the CSU, won the largest share of the vote. The centre-left SPD had its worst election result in the post-war period, after governing with the CDU in 2013-17. Following a failed attempt by the CDU to form a coalition without the SPD, another grand coalition was formed in early 2018 and installed on March 14th. Although German politics will remain over-whelmingly centrist and consensus-driven in The Economist Intelligence Unit's 2018-22 forecast period, there will be a greater divergence of views both in the Bundestag and in the cabinet, resulting in more robust debate and a less predictable outlook.
The SPD's previous experiences in coalition under Angela Merkel, the leader of the CDU and chancellor since 2005, have been woeful, and the party's public support has collapsed from 41% in 1998 to about 18% in current opinion polls. The SPD is suffering the same fate as many other European social democratic parties at present-including those in France and the Netherlands-and is losing its status as one of the two "big tent" parties, in part as a result of the political fragmentation of its traditional working-class electorate. A change in the party's leadership-with Andrea Nahles, the labour and social affairs minister in the outgoing government, taking over-offers the prospect of a change in the party's fortunes. The SPD controls the ministries responsible for finance, foreign affairs, and labour and social affairs in the incoming government, and will attempt to use these positions to differentiate the party from Ms Merkel's CDU in the coming years. This will lead to further tensions between the coalition partners and contribute to a more volatile political scene.
The CDU is not in as precarious a position as the SPD, but it will also find this term more challenging and unstable than the previous one. The fall in the CDU's vote share in the 2017 election, the lengthy coalition negotiations and the party's generosity to the SPD in the negotiations have all weakened Ms Merkel at the start of what will almost certainly be her last term. Strong pressure both from within the CDU and from the CSU to move to the right on issues such as immigration and integration will hamper government effectiveness. This will also play into the contest to succeed Ms Merkel as the dominant figure on the centre right, which will create political instability, especially in the latter part of the government's three-and-a-half-year term.
The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) entered the Bundestag for the first time in the October election. Not only is this the first time that a far-right party has been represented in the Bundestag in more than 50 years, but with another grand coalition taking office, it has become the largest opposition party. The AfD is now the second-largest political force in much of the former East Germany, where voters' dissatisfaction with the govern-ment's handling of the 2015-16 migration crisis fed into deeper frustrations about the lack of convergence between east and west Germany since reunification. It is already proving to be a loud and fractious presence in the Bundestag, but it will also be subject to in-fighting, given divisions between radicals and less extreme members.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness
The quality of administration is high, and the implementation of policies that have been passed by the federal parliament is sound. The federal structure of the government means that considerable responsibility falls on the 16 states that constitute the federal republic. An advantage of this is that many issues are decided with the closer democratic involvement of the electorate. States have a strong incentive to improve their own quality of governance, as comparisons with other states are easy to make, although one drawback is that the quality of public services such as education can vary significantly between states. Another disadvantage is that co-ordination can be troublesome in policy areas where the states have a large role. This has been the case in recent years. For instance, although the federal government had allocated additional funds for infrastructure investment, lower governments were often unable to use these for additional investment owing to capacity constraints.
The design of the system also means that the constitutional powers enjoyed by the Bundesrat may on occasion limit the ability of the federal government to push through reforms in the face of opposition at state level. However, the upper house does not have the right of veto on all aspects of legislation, and the proportion of laws requiring its approval was reduced in 2006. The last of these changes aimed to reduce the share of legislation requiring Bundesrat approval from about 60% to 35-40%, but the actual impact has been less dramatic. In exchange for this loss of influence over federal legislation, the states now have greater influence over the implementation of federal laws and have gained some additional powers, particularly in education.
Majority governments are the norm in Germany, at both the federal and the state levels. This generally ensures smooth policymaking, as the coalition agreement usually sets out in advance what the government will be working on throughout its term. In the coming years we expect increased pressure on policymaking at the federal level, as the coalition is likely to be more fractured than in its previous term. The SPD's wish to differentiate itself more clearly from the CDU will hamper effective policymaking, and jockeying for position within the CDU to replace Ms Merkel as leader of the party will weigh on government effectiveness.
Political outlook: Election watch
The next federal election is scheduled for 2021. A state election is due to be held in Bavaria in October 2018, and in the run-up to this date tensions within the coalition are likely. The CSU may decide to go against the coalition line on issues such as migration in order to ward off the electoral threat from the AfD.
Political outlook: International relations
The external environment has become a source of uncertainty in recent years. The UK's vote to leave the EU, strains over the migrant relocation agreement, and the challenges to the bloc posed by the governments in Hungary and Poland have put pressure on the European community. Meanwhile, further afield, the actions of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan-the presidents of the US, Russia and Turkey respectively-are serving to undermine the global rules-based order that Germany has always held as the gold standard. The election of Emmanuel Macron as president of France was welcomed in Germany as enabling a more balanced Franco-German partner-ship at the heart of the bloc. Nevertheless, Germany is likely to remain the most influential player in the EU owing to the structural elements supporting German power within the bloc, most importantly its dominant economy.
Mr Macron's proposed European reforms, especially those regarding the euro zone, have met with mixed reactions. There is a broad consensus in Germany against fiscal transfers within the bloc, and despite some positive notes on euro zone reform in the coalition agreement, Germany will-together with several other north European countries-refuse to agree to any reforms that might in-crease fiscal risk sharing. More likely to find German support are proposals such as greater defence integration and European border control. So far Ms Merkel has been cautiously open to the process of reform kick-started by Mr Macron, and she is likely to support the idea of further integration among "coalitions of the willing" within the EU.
The US is, and will remain, Germany's most important non-EU partner on the global stage, but the relationship between Mr Trump and Ms Merkel has been rocky so far. Mr Trump has been critical of Germany's trade surplus with the US and its below-target spending on defence. We expect tensions to continue in the coming years, with the US's decision in March to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports possibly a harbinger of similar conflicts to come, even though the EU was granted a temporary waiver, which was extended for another 30 days at the end of April. Efforts will also be made to lessen German dependence on the US for defence-although spending is unlikely to be raised to a level sufficient to break this dependency. In the meantime Ms Merkel will continue to manage the relationship to avoid confrontations with Mr Trump.
Following the annexation of Crimea in 2014 Germany took a decisive line against Russia, breaking with decades of relatively good relations and pushing against the reluctance of many south and central European nations to impose far-reaching EU sanctions-a position that it has maintained ever since. This was highlighted by its decision, in line with a large number of other EU countries, to expel four Russian diplomats in the wake of an attack in the UK on a former Russian military intelligence officer on March 4th. We expect the EU sanctions to remain in place over the medium term, although pragmatic co-operation between Germany and Russia will continue, especially on energy.

Germany's score in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings increases slightly from 8.19 in the historical period (2013-17) to 8.24 in the forecast period (2018-22). However, owing to larger gains elsewhere, the country falls in the global and regional rankings. Germany was the eighth most attractive business location in the world in 2013-17, but it drops to tenth position in 2018-22, and the country's regional ranking declines from fourth to sixth place among its 17 peers. Strong fundamentals underpin Germany's high score and ranking for the macroeconomic environment, supporting a small improvement in financing conditions. Modest declines in the foreign trade and market opportunities categories reflect the uncertainty for business caused by the Brexit process and the broader push-back against global trade liberalisation. Overall, most of the scores in our business environment categories are expected to remain broadly stable-an indictment of the previous coalition government's unadventurous policy agenda and our expectation that "reform fatigue" will endure over the coming years. This is disappointing given the fiscal space in Germany's public finances, the weaknesses that persist in the tax system and network infrastructure, and the country's demographic challenges.
Political stability will mainly be tested by region-wide issues
Germany's main strengths are its political stability, skilled labour force, openness to external trade and investment, and strong research and innovation framework. The political environment is reasonably robust, with a mature democratic system and efficient public administration, but stability will be tested by internal coalition pressures and region-wide issues related to immigration, Brexit, Russia and reform of euro zone structures. The tax regime places a substantial burden on labour income and on companies, alongside high administrative costs. The phase-out of nuclear power raises questions about the cost of renewables and energy supply security.

Business environment outlook: Germany's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: The state maintains its involvement in the financial sector, railways and telecommunications. Firms' administrative burden is reasonable, but some areas of weakness remain. Protective regulation across the services sector persists.
2020-22: Limited prospects for reforming regulated services professions. State ownership levels remain broadly unchanged.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: The government generally welcomes foreign direct investment, but takeovers of major media, infrastructure and finance companies could run into political resistance. Investment from China is increasingly unwelcome.
2020-22: Possible erosion of barriers against foreign takeovers as a result of commercial pressures and EU law.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Risk of worsening EU-Russia relations and US-sparked trade tensions leading to a global trade war.
2020-22: Informal UK-EU trade arrangement and ongoing formal talks expected, but risk of no deal and disruption to trade.
Taxes
2018-19: Some fiscal loosening begins, including some targeted tax cuts via phased abolition of "solidarity surcharge", but a comparatively high tax burden persists.
2020-22: Incremental income tax relief is likely amid pressure to strengthen work incentives for lower-income earners. Possible phased abolition or reduction of "solidarity surcharge". Modest reform of corporate tax regime.
Financing
2018-19: European Central Bank (ECB) policy stance and unprecedented liquidity hold down banks' funding costs, but pressure on margins persists amid weak profitability and tighter regulation. Moves to attract financial services firms from UK.
2020-22: Banks face further calls to boost equity bases. Possible US-led rollback of some global financial sector regulation.
The labour market
2018-19: Unemployment remains low. Restrictions on temporary employment. Skilled labour shortages start to emerge.
2020-22: Limited prospects for reform to address structural challenges arising from ageing demographics and rising share of migrant workers. Increased provision of childcare facilities leads to moderate rise in female participation.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Modest rise in public infrastructure investment. Focus on maintenance of existing road and rail networks. Further delays in opening of flagship airport in Berlin. Continued calls from energy sector for improvement of power grid.
2020-22: New sources of finance are sought through public-private partnerships, but investment remains limited.
Technological readiness
2018-19: The government prioritises upgrading the country's digital infrastructure, starting with an optical fibre network.
2020-22: Efforts continue on Industry 4.0, which focuses on upgrading the country's manufacturing prowess through increased use of automation and connected systems. Increasing threat from cyber-crime and cyber-espionage.

A robust economic upswing in recent years has been supported by a resilient labour market, modest inflation, solid household finances, external stimulus from relatively low oil prices and accommodative European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy, and a synchronised expansion of global demand. We expect the euro zone economy to lose some momentum as pent-up demand fades, but macroeconomic fundamentals in Germany will remain broadly favourable, with healthy public finances, low unemployment, a competitive export sector and helpful financing conditions, backed by a strong institutional framework.
However, a number of structural supply-side challenges will become more apparent. Relatively weak business investment and public infrastructure spending over the past decade, viewed alongside the government's limited reform plans, does not augur well for medium-term productivity and potential growth. Policy will also be tested by ageing demographics and a gradual decline in the working-age population (raising the risk of skilled labour shortages), emerging strains in parts of the housing market and the disruptive impact of new technologies on the dominant automotive sector.
Germany's large current-account surplus has long implied an inefficient allocation of resources, domestically and within the euro zone. It reflects an unusually large volume of savings in Germany (that are largely invested abroad), driven in part by fiscal conservatism, low investment and population ageing. It also underlines the significant exposure of the economy to world trade flows and to shifts in external demand. An increase in global trade protectionism represents the most serious near-term risk to growth, with businesses also facing uncertainty over the UK's Brexit process, the prospect of a downturn in the US economy in 2019-20 and weakening Chinese demand.

Policy towards private enterprise and competition is generally liberal and will remain so over the forecast period. Particular strengths include a well-developed framework for research and innovation, a stable legal code and integrated supply chains across the EU. The competition authority, the Federal Cartel Office, has a solid reputation for being unbiased and efficient. However, Germany fares less well in other areas of the business environment. Weaknesses include inefficiencies in the corporate tax regime, restricted competition in parts of the services sector and subdued entrepreneurial activity. The country's regulatory framework for companies is reasonable, but lags some of its regional peers. According to the World Bank's 2018 Doing Business report, the administrative processes involved in obtaining utilities and credit, enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency are fairly low. In contrast, the number of procedures and time taken to set up a new business are well above the average for high-income OECD countries, tax administration is often complex and costly, and registration of property can be protracted.
Protective regulations across the business services sector will persist
Liberalisation of product markets has progressed gradually, but regulations remain comparatively restrictive in some utilities and transport sectors, retail and business services. There has been negligible domestic reform in these areas and successive governments have resisted efforts to open up the EU services market to greater competition. EU-wide access to the German public procurement market is more restricted than in the UK and France.
Across the wider economy, state involvement is fairly modest. Most domestic post-crisis emergency measures in the financial sector have been rolled back, although the state retains holdings in three recapitalised banks and will continue to oversee the run-off of substantial legacy assets in a Special Fund for Financial Market Stabilisation (SoFFin). The framework of state-owned regional and savings banks carries political clout. The federal government wholly owns the state railway, Deutsche Bahn; holds a 32% share in the former national telecommunications monopolist, Deutsche Telekom; and has a 21% stake in the former postal monopoly, Deutsche Post.
Recent reforms to reduce firms' administrative burdens have been modest and no major changes are anticipated in 2018-22. A 2016 "bureaucracy relief" act introduced a "one-in, one-out" rule for new regulations likely to impose costs on companies, and eased record-keeping requirements for start-ups.
Studies by the European Commission have showed Germany to have some of the most restrictive regulation in business services among all EU member states, with around a third of the labour force estimated to be employed in regulated professions (these include lawyers, accountants, architects and engineers). Strong vested interests point to limited prospects for reform, with the government showing little inclination to enact liberalising measures.

FDI policy is fairly liberal, but greenfield investment is preferred
Policy towards foreign investment is fairly liberal-as in most EU countries-but subsidies or financial incentives aimed directly at attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) are limited and focused mainly on research and development (R&D) support. Germany Trade and Invest (GTAI) is the federal body responsible for FDI relations, with a state-owned development bank, KfW, the main provider of financial subsidies. Investor programmes do not discriminate between foreign and local investment. As in most countries, green-field FDI is viewed as preferable to foreign acquisitions of domestic companies. Restrictions on hostile takeovers are considerable, whether the acquirer is foreign or domestic. Notice of strategic goals and "acting in concert" is mandatory for large investments. Constraints are more pronounced with respect to acquisitions of major utility companies, reflecting security of energy supply issues. According to data from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), in 2016 Germany was home to the eighth-largest stock of FDI in the world, and the fourth largest in the EU after the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands.
The government has the right to veto acquisitions of equity stakes above 25% in German companies by non-EU investors if these are deemed not to be in the national interest. The veto has yet to be applied, but could be tested in the coming years amid gradual signs of an increasing pushback (at both domestic and EU level) against FDI inflows from Asia, and particularly China. A recent rise in these inflows has prompted concerns over the potential loss of technological know-how and the sale of strategic assets, especially in the case of investment by Chinese state-owned firms. In 2017 the European Commission announced plans to establish a regional framework for screening FDI into the EU on grounds of national security. Some member states have criticised the plans as being clearly protectionist in nature, although the Commission argues that similar initiatives exist in other major trading partners such as China and the US.
A recent trend in many countries has been an increasing share of FDI activity reflecting "corporate reconfiguration"-changes in complex multinational ownership structures-which often has a minimal impact on output and employment in the host economy. This is expected to continue over the forecast period as firms' tax-planning practices continue to evolve.

Trade talks will focus on bilateral deals, amid global trade tensions
Germany's foreign trade regime is defined by its EU membership. Free movement of goods, services, capital and persons exists within the EU and we do not expect any exchange controls. No tariffs or quotas are permitted within the bloc and the EU has abolished most other non-tariff restrictions. The EU trades with Norway and Iceland under the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), has a range of bilateral agreements with Switzerland and a customs union with Turkey. Only agriculture is excluded from all these arrangements.
Trade between EU member states and third countries has been largely governed by multilateral agreements administered by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), but there has been minimal progress in world trade talks over the past decade. Growing opposition in many countries (notably the US) to further trade liberalisation implies no prospect of headway over the forecast period. The EU's focus will be on bilateral deals and we expect further gradual progress to be made in this area. The backdrop will be challenging, however, given a rise in protectionist measures implemented by governments around the world and the recent transition in US trade policy from protectionist rhetoric to more concrete action. These actions are likely to inhibit global trade flows and there is a notable risk that an escalating chain reaction of measures could occur, threatening a more dramatic fraying of the multilateral trade system.
The EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) will gradually come into force in 2018-22. CETA will eliminate most trade tariffs, ease border procedures and increase regulatory co-operation. In December 2017 the EU finalised an economic partnership agreement with Japan that will create the world's largest free-trade area. The deal will come into effect from early 2019, although there will be a lengthy transition phase for most measures over the next decade. In April 2018 the EU and Mexico agreed in principle to a trade deal that would include a significant reduction of tariffs.
Germany will play a leading role in the complex Brexit negotiations ahead of (and following) the UK's scheduled withdrawal from the EU in March 2019. The UK accounts for about 6.6% of German exports and is the country's fifth most important trading partner. The wider political context (and the EU's strong negotiating position) will, however, drive a resolute German approach in the talks. There is a clear risk that a breakdown in talks could lead to a "hard Brexit" without any form of trade accord in prospect.

Tax burden will remain high on labour income and companies
The tax/GDP ratio in Germany has remained broadly stable over the past decade and stood at 40% in 2016 (latest available data), in line with the EU average and slightly below that for the euro zone (41%). Direct taxes on personal income and net social security contributions account for a higher than average share of overall tax receipts, and a lower proportion of revenue is derived from taxes on corporate income, goods and services (such as value-added tax, VAT), and property. There are three personal income tax rates, ranging from 14% to 45%, with the top rate levied on annual incomes over EUR260,500. There is also a "solidarity surcharge"-a 5.5% levy on income that has been in effect since 1991 to finance reunification costs. The standard VAT rate is 19%, slightly below the EU average, with a reduced rate of 7% on certain goods and services.
Despite robust jobs growth in Germany over recent years, the tax system is not that supportive of employment or private investment, with a relatively high tax burden on labour income and on companies. In 2017 the average single worker faced a tax wedge-the difference between workers' take-home pay and what it costs to employ them-of 49.7%, the second highest in the OECD, after Belgium. This high burden, including on low-income workers, acts as a disincentive for second earners and partly accounts for the modest full-time employment rate among women. The tax burden on firms is also elevated, even though the headline federal corporation tax rate is just 15%. After including the impact of a local trade tax (Gewerbesteuer) and the solidarity surcharge, the effective average corporation tax rate is around 28%, compared with an EU average of about 21%. In addition, the country's tax system for firms is quite complex, with fairly high administration costs. Tax treatment favours debt over equity, which could hinder private investment and might partly account for Germany's underdeveloped venture capital market.
The public finances are robust by advanced economy standards, with the general government budget recording a fourth consecutive annual surplus in 2017. This implies more room for manoeuvre than in most peer economies, but with both major parties broadly supportive of a cautious fiscal stance, no significant overhaul of tax policy is expected.
The one agreed change by the new coalition government is a gradual phased abolition of the solidarity surcharge for lower- and middle-income earners, which will provide some modest tax relief. There are also likely to be some targeted measures to incentivise business investment, building on recent reforms to the tax framework for start-ups and investment funds.

Support for the financial sector will continue, amid slow reforms
Germany's financial sector was badly affected by the 2008-09 global slump. Officials and regulators were slow to acknowledge the failings in the banking system, which had invested heavily in exotic asset-backed securities. The underlying resilience of the sector has since improved, in response to significant balance sheet restructuring and consolidation, and as banks have bolstered their capital bases, asset quality and liquidity positions in line with tighter regulation and stronger economic conditions. At end-2017 estimates of Tier 1 capital adequacy were around the regional average and the share of non-performing loans was modest. Huge monetary support from the ECB has reduced banks' funding costs and supported a pick-up in credit growth, but the protracted low-interest-rate environment has weighed heavily on bank profitability in Germany, which is among the weakest in the EU. Despite a moderate shift towards commission- and fee-based revenue generation, the business model of most German banks remains geared towards interest income, which has resulted in low returns on equity. Comparatively high operating costs and rising pressure on margins from regulatory requirements and the adoption of digitisation have spurred major cost-cutting programmes and job losses across the sector, including at the two largest financial institutions, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank. More structural adjustments will be required over the forecast period to avert a potential loss of investor confidence, and doubts will persist about the underlying strength of some state-owned regional lenders (Landesbanken), which faced huge losses during the crisis and remain in a weakened condition. Germany has a tradition of small local credit co-operatives and public-sector savings banks (owned by local authorities) that aim to service the Mittelstand. These account for the majority of credit institutions, and strong competition among them is one reason why retail banking in Germany is less profitable than in other European countries.
The credit cycle in Germany and across the euro zone has firmed over recent years amid improved economic conditions. According to ECB figures, total lending by financial institutions to the German private sector (including to other financial intermediaries) rose by 4.6% in 2017, a modest acceleration from growth of 4.2% in 2016 and 3.1% in 2015. This followed three successive years of decline. Demand for mortgage borrowing has risen by a steady 4% per year since 2015. Recently there has been faster growth in unsecured consumer credit and in lending to corporates, but sentiment showed signs of weakening in early 2018.
Internally generated funds account for an above-average share of corporate financing in Germany, reflecting firms' lower reliance on capital markets than in most large advanced economies. Equity capital accounts for the largest share of funding, but is below the EU average. Bank credit was traditionally the preferred financing channel, being comparatively cheap and available at long maturities, but demand has weakened over the past decade amid a steady process of deleveraging. The private-equity and venture capital markets are growing, but remain small in an international comparison. Securitisation and use of credit derivatives are quite common, but the market is not as developed as in some other high-income countries.
Brexit-related market volatility and regulatory changes could lead to additional costs and capital needs for parts of Germany's financial sector. The UK's exit from the EU will also create more opportunities for the expansion of the country's financial services hub of Frankfurt, as regulatory requirements will mean that London's relative appeal as a financial centre partly diminishes. A specific objective of the new coalition programme is to make Germany a more attractive location for financial institutions.

A well-performing labour market, but demographic challenges lie ahead
Germany has a robust labour market, with a high rate of employment, solid employer-employee relations, a well-respected apprenticeship system, a statutory nationwide minimum wage and a record-low jobless rate (3.4% of the labour force in March 2018, the third-lowest level in the EU and far below an EU average of 7.1%). Unemployment has fallen steadily over the past decade (from a peak of 11.2% in 2005) and the employment rate has trended higher, to almost 80% at end-2017 (among those aged 20-64). Recent labour demand has been bolstered by the economic upswing, but the impressive headline labour market indicators can also be traced back to the impact of contentious reforms implemented by previous governments. Liberalising measures, tighter welfare eligibility and decentralisation of wage bargaining were accompanied by a long period of earnings restraint that strengthened productivity, jobs growth and competitiveness during the 2000s, when most EU countries experienced a steady increase in labour costs. This approach was unpopular with workers in Germany at the time-and constrained household spending-but has since underpinned the country's consistently high employment rate. Recent evidence would suggest that it has also lowered the rate at which unemployment would generate wage inflation. Despite a record-low jobless rate and growing labour shortages, average whole-economy earnings growth has remained very subdued, although collective wage agreements signed in early 2018 point to a modest acceleration over the next couple of years.
Alongside modest wage growth, there are some other less positive features of the labour market. Although the overall female employment rate is comparatively high (75% at end-2017), participation of women in full-time equivalent work is modest, partly owing to limited childcare availability and tax system disincentives for second earners. About 5m Germans (mainly female) were employed in part-time, low-wage "mini-jobs" at end-2017. Across the economy as a whole, the share of low-skill, low-wage employment has risen steadily over the past decade. There is also a significant gap between the employment and inactivity rates of female EU and non-EU nationals (more so than for men), implying transition issues for those with a migrant background into the labour market, and underuse of potential labour. Although the employment prospects of older workers have improved, the challenges posed by Germany's ageing population mean that reforms will be needed to strengthen incentives for later retirement (in contrast to a 2014 pension bill that expanded early retirement options) and improve lifelong learning policies.
Skilled labour shortages have been a topic of debate in Germany for some time, but the problem appears to have become more acute over the past year, with surveys regularly highlighting firms' concerns over a lack of skilled labour and its impact on business operations. Germany's negative demographic trends mean that the situation is only likely to get worse. Inflows of migrant labour will help to some extent and Brexit could be beneficial, by attracting more financial services staff to Germany and re-routing some immigrants who would otherwise have gone to the UK. However, vacancy rates suggest that these arrivals will not be sufficient to meet labour demand. As the political mood is not conducive to greater immigration, the focus may need to shift to removing incentives for early retirement or encouraging female full-time employment.

Infrastructure is decent, but greater capital investment is needed
The quality of network infrastructure has traditionally been one of the strengths of Germany's business environment, but a period of subdued capital investment has resulted in a modest deterioration of standards and raised concerns that capacity issues could hamper progress in digitisation and the medium-term energy transition policy (Energiewende) towards renewables. We expect some improvement over the forecast period in response to an upturn in public investment, targeted primarily at digital infrastructure and social housing, although some weaknesses will persist.
Transport infrastructure is well developed, but spending restraint has contributed to rising congestion and a backlog of repairs. The previous government announced a new Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan (FTIP) in 2016, proposing expenditure of EUR270bn on about 1,000 projects up to 2030. About 70% of the intended funds will be allocated to maintaining existing road and rail networks. The FTIP is more of a basic framework for policy than a specific funding plan. Its broad focus is welcome, but implementation will depend on attracting private investment, and overcoming regulatory hurdles and weak co-ordination between federal and local government. Airport investment will be underpinned by robust passenger demand, but construction of a new flagship airport, Berlin-Brandenburg, has been beset with problems and budget overruns. Opening has been repeatedly delayed from 2011 to 2020. The mobile telecoms and broadband markets are competitive, but Germany lags many of its peers in provision of high-speed broadband services.
The post-Fukushima decision by the government in 2011 to phase out domestic nuclear power by 2022 has driven a steady shift towards other forms of renewable energy, subsidies for which have contributed to high household energy bills. Expansion of renewables' capacity is ahead of target, but its share of the energy mix has been constrained by the sluggish pace of power grid development and dependence on heavily polluting coal. Carbon emissions are declining only slowly, undermining Germany's green credentials.
Since 2015 the government has allocated EUR4.5bn to a national broad-band programme that aims to provide network speeds of at least 50 megabits per second (mbps) across Germany by end-2018. This objective is unlikely to be met, mainly because of still limited fast broadband availability in rural and remote areas, but steady improvements in the network are expected in the coming years, as this has become one of the new government's main policy objectives.

This category, introduced in 2018, aims to show the extent to which the business environment is open to innovation, digitally connected and prepared for technological disruption. Germany scores highly on a regional and global basis, reflecting the scope of its existing digital infrastructure; strong e-commerce and e-business penetration; above-average digital skill levels; a national Industry 4.0 initiative aimed at supporting digital manufacturing; and a well-developed framework for research and innovation. A weaker aspect is the fairly limited scope of e-government services. Total investment in R&D was 2.9% of GDP in 2016, one of the highest ratios in the EU. R&D intensity has trended steadily higher over the past decade, driven primarily by larger firms in the medium- and high-tech manufacturing sectors. Germany ranked among seven "innovation leaders" in the European Commission's European Innovation Scoreboard 2017, scoring particularly well in terms of business investment and small and medium-sized enterprise innovation activity, but lagging its peers in the areas of financing support and entrepreneurship. There are pockets of entrepreneurial dynamism, such as Berlin, but measures of innovative high-growth firms and start-up activity have weakened slightly in recent years. Germany has established a National Cyber Response Centre and has updated its official cybersecurity strategy on several occasions since 2011. According to the Global Cybersecurity Index, published by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in 2017, Germany was ranked 24th globally in terms of its commitment and capacity to deal with the rapidly increasing threat from cyber-crime and cyber-espionage.
In late 2016 the government unveiled its Digital Strategy 2025, setting objectives for the deployment of fifth-generation (5G) mobile services by end-2020 and a nationwide gigabit-capable infrastructure network by 2025. The EUR100bn project will be driven by a public-private consortium comprising the government and telecoms operators.
Economic forecast: Policy trends
The presence of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in the previous government enabled progress on some typically social democratic policy goals, including the introduction of a lower retirement age for some workers and a statutory minimum wage. The coalition agreement suggests that a slight loosening of fiscal policy can be expected, to be implemented through increased public invest-ment in infrastructure and digital technologies, greater spending on childcare, and by lowering income tax. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any large-scale structural reform efforts.
We expect significant structural challenges to have emerged by the 2020s. The poor demographic outlook is a particular problem, with the working-age population heading into decline and the population structure ageing. The dominant automotive sector also faces rising uncertainty following the Dieselgate emissions-rigging scandal and allegations of cartel behaviour, and given disruptive technological trends in the industry. The government's Industry 4.0 initiative is intended to ensure that the dominant German manufacturing sector remains at the fore-front of advances in robotics, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, but the country will face strong competition from China, South Korea and Japan in these areas in the coming decades. Social changes will also require policymakers' attention, with crucial questions including how best to integrate large numbers of refugees and whether the need to combat terrorism should supersede the country's long-standing aversion to surveillance.

Steady consolidation of the public finances was a focus of the outgoing government, which in 2017 met its schwarze Null target-a balanced federal budget on the national measure-for the fourth consecutive year, at 1.3% of GDP. Public spending will be nudged upwards and the surplus downwards during the forecast period by increased health and long-term care expenditure, and by a degree of fiscal loosening. Nonetheless, with revenue growth remaining solid, and given the deep-seated commitment across the political spectrum to the schwarze Null target, we expect the public finances to stay in surplus throughout our forecast period, even if the government decides to increase spending and lower income taxes. As a result, the public debt/GDP ratio will continue to fall, from a peak of 81.1% in 2010 to less than the EU mandated limit of 60% from 2019.

The European Central Bank (ECB) is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a quantitative easing (QE) programme that ran at EUR60bn per month until the end of 2017, and is running at EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018. However, the ECB's view of the outlook improved markedly during 2017 and, although it remains dovish, we expect a more upbeat tone to emerge this year, and an end to monthly asset purchases under the QE programme at the end of 2018. Rising commodity prices and evidence of building domestic price pressure in some parts of the euro zone should mean that sufficient inflationary pressures will begin to emerge on the policy horizon in 2019-20. In response, we expect the ECB to take steps towards normalising its policy stance with an increase of 25 basis points in the main refinancing rate, to 0.25%, in early 2020, followed by five more rises that lift the main refinancing rate to 1.5% by end-2022. An increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019, easing the pressure on banks' lending margins and supporting profitability.

Real GDP growth averaged 2.5% in 2017, the strongest annual expansion since 2011, in line with a cyclical upturn across the euro zone. Private consumption provided the largest contribution to growth, followed by investment spending. Industrial output and trade volumes picked up significantly.
We expect private consumption to remain the main driver of 2.3% GDP growth in 2018 as employment continues to rise and nominal wage growth strengthens. Increases in state pensions and low borrowing costs will further support household spending. The tight labour market is starting to feed through into significant wage increases, with the union for metalworkers, IG Metall, achieving a wage rise of about 5% for almost 4m workers, and public-sector workers getting wage increases of over 3% in 2018 and 2019. However, just below half of German workers are covered by collective wage agreements, meaning that headline wage growth will remain below these figures.
External demand will remain robust, with growth in the US picking up and growth in the euro zone easing only marginally. We expect external trade to contribute positively to German GDP again in 2018, supported by continued momentum in industry. Given intensifying capacity constraints in manufacturing, and the emergence of skills shortages in the light of the tight labour market, we expect gross fixed capital formation to provide a further spur to headline GDP growth this year.
Domestic conditions will continue to be supportive in the remainder of the forecast period and private consumption will remain the largest contributor to growth. Investment spending will receive a boost from increased public investment; greater business investment, driven by capacity constraints and investment in new technologies; and moderate additional residential construction. Although this will push up imports, the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector will keep the external balance's contribution to headline growth positive. Nevertheless, we expect growth to slow from an annual average of 2.3% in 2017-19 to just above its potential rate in 2020-22, at 1.7%.
Downside risks to the economic outlook include a more protectionist US trade policy and a disorderly UK exit from the EU, although neither of these forms part of our core scenario. A further challenge is that the country's flagship industry, the automotive sector, risks being disrupted by technological change after a long-term emphasis on diesel technology. Over the longer term, Germany's poor demographic outlook will increasingly constrain potential growth, with the working-age population declining.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends
Services account for about 69% of GDP, industry (including construction) for 30% and agriculture the remainder. Manufacturing accounts for about 23% of gross value added-a considerably higher proportion than in most other industrialised economies. Moreover, in contrast with many of Germany's peers, manu-facturing's share of gross value added has remained broadly stable over the past two decades. Nevertheless, we expect industry's share of gross value added to edge down slightly in our 2018-22 forecast period, to just under 30% in 2022. A fall in the relative importance of manufacturing is the inevitable result of rising living standards: as people get wealthier they spend a higher proportion of their income on services and a lower pro-portion on manufactured goods. However, it also reflects the changing nature of manufacturing, as even Germany's industrial champions increasingly provide value added through services supplied in conjunction with manufactured products.
Strong industrial sector faces medium-term threats from new technology
Germany's most important manufacturing sectors are automotive, electrical and mechanical engineering, chemicals, and food, drink and tobacco. Germany is the global leader in the production of premium cars, an industry that has benefited from robust competition between several domestic companies, ownership structures that have enabled firms to make long-term investment, and a host of innovative supplier companies in the mechanical and electrical engineering sectors. Although many of the industry's main European markets experienced a weak recovery following the 2008-09 global financial crisis, sales in emerging markets such as China and India have been strong. As major producers of capital goods, German firms were able to weather the years following the global financial crisis by profiting from rapid industrialisation in emerging markets. Capital goods demand from within the euro zone has now started to recover, offsetting slower growth in many emerging markets.
Most industries derive competitive advantages from Germany's well-developed system of vocational training, good physical infrastructure and research base, and a tax system that encourages capital investment. German manufacturers will continue to profit from emerging-market demand, and the outlook for demand from other European countries should gradually improve further. Low interest rates will continue to stimulate residential construction, ensuring relatively strong growth in overall construction activity. However, from 2022 onwards we expect larger threats to the dominance of German industry to emerge, particularly to the automotive industry. New technologies, such as electric cars and self-driving cars, could pose challenges the industry's position, especially as it is still dealing with the fallout of the diesel-emissions scandal and the move away from diesel technology, in which it had invested heavily in recent decades.
The services sector is the largest component of GDP and comprises a broad range of activities, from retailing to financial services, logistics and healthcare. Services sector growth in Germany was relatively weak in the years following the global financial crisis, held back by subdued growth in household income. However, with the recent strong improvements in the labour market and the concurrent improving outlook for private consumption, services sector activity expanded relatively strongly in 2016-17 and we expect it to continue to do so in the coming years. One source of uncertainty is the financial services industry. In common with the rest of Europe, German financial services were hit hard by the economic downturn. Although solvency indicators have improved, many German banks remain vulnerable to the effects of any renewed shock. Furthermore, the sector has seen relatively little reform in recent years compared with regional peers. The weakness of the banking sector has the potential to restrict growth prospects over the forecast period. A possible upside risk is that some financial services activity may move from London to Frankfurt following the UK's departure from the EU. Although some relocations have already been announced, we expect these moves to remain relatively limited, and do not expect Frankfurt to take over London's role as Europe's main financial hub.
Agriculture contributes less than 1% of GDP, one of the lowest proportions in the EU. We expect this share to remain broadly unchanged throughout the forecast period as public- and private-sector investment continues to focus on other sectors of the economy.

Price growth rose to 1.7% in 2017, driven primarily by energy price base effects. Underlying inflationary pressures remain weak, but we expect wage growth to pick up soon, in part driven by a number of recently struck collective bargaining agreements that included significant pay rises for, among others, workers in the public and metals sectors. This will start feeding through into inflation in the course of this year. With only a modest further recovery in energy prices over 2018-22, we expect price growth to remain slightly below the ECB's target of "below, but close to, 2%", although relative economic out-performance will keep inflation above the euro zone average. We forecast average annual inflation in Germany of 1.7% in 2018-22.

For most of 2015-16 the euro moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1, before a sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following the presidential election in the US led to a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1. However, in 2017 the euro rallied as the region's economic recovery strengthened and expectations of QE tapering increased, and as political risk waned in Europe but rose in the US. The exchange rate peaked at almost US$1.25:EUR1 at the beginning of February 2018 and has stabilised just below this level in March-April. The value of the euro could yet come under pressure from political risk-especially in the wake of the March 2018 general election in Italy-and monetary tightening in the US. Nevertheless, we expect a gradual appreciation on average, to US$1.21:EUR1 by 2020-21, as the euro is supported by an ongoing recovery in the region and receives structural support from a large current-account surplus, while the business cycle downturn in the US will weigh on the value of the dollar in 2020. Thereafter we expect the euro to appreciate to US$1.24:EUR1 on average in 2022.

Germany's sizeable current-account surplus declined slightly in 2017, to 8.1% of GDP, from a historical high of 8.9% in 2015, in part driven by a widening secondary income deficit as remittance outflows increased following several years of high immigration. Germany will continue to post huge trade surpluses, reflecting the competitiveness of its manufacturing sector and comparatively low levels of domestic consumption and investment. This will continue to generate large domestic savings that are mainly invested abroad, leading to a solid primary income surplus. Trade and primary income surpluses will comfortably outweigh small structural deficits on the services and secondary income accounts. We expect the current-account surplus to remain substantial, declining gradually to just above 6% of GDP by 2022. These large surpluses will continue to provoke criticism, within Europe and globally, about Germany's role in prolonging demand shortfalls in much of the rest of the euro zone.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Germany
Stocks and flows
Germany is an attractive destination for foreign investment, but on balance the country is a net exporter of long-term capital. The skills of its workforce, the availability of supplier companies, the quality of the research and innovation framework, and a reliable administrative and legal environment make Germany one of the most attractive destinations in the world for inward foreign direct investment (FDI). However, relative to GDP the stock of such investment is lower than in some other comparatively sized economies. Following a significant increase in inflows during the 1990s, the rate of growth of FDI then slowed, falling below the world average. The global financial crisis then reduced inflows to around a tenth of previous years' levels at the lowest point, in 2008. Inward foreign investment has since recovered, but outflows have continued to be larger than inflows. At end-2017 the inward FDI stock was equivalent to just under 45% of GDP, compared with around 90% for the EU as a whole.
Origin and distribution
As is the case in other developed countries, the FDI stock in Germany is increasingly dominated by service providers rather than by manufacturers, although manufacturers remain important, in line with the relatively large size of the manufacturing sector. Around three-quarters of Germany's inward FDI stock originates from other EU member states-although this sometimes includes investment from outside the EU that is transferred through countries such as the Netherlands and Luxembourg (the largest and second-largest foreign direct investors in Germany respectively), often for tax reasons. The most important investor from outside the EU is the US. Authorities and companies have become increasingly hesitant about increasing investment from China, which often targets mid-sized companies with significant technological knowhow. This is likely to weigh on investment from China in the coming years, as Germany has put its weight behind new investment screening measures at the EU level. Most outward investment is to other EU countries, but investment in Switzerland, the US, Russia and China is also significant.
Determinants
German labour costs are among the highest in the world, but have been made more competitive by a period of falling or stagnant growth in real wages over the past decade. A minimum wage was introduced in 2015, but has not had a significant effect on employment levels, reflecting at least in part the healthy state of the labour market. Regulations such as the right of worker representatives to sit on company boards (up to half of board members) have deterred some foreign investors, but in practice the system of workforce representation in companies often helps company management bodies to communicate their strategies and, where necessary, explain the need for changes in working practice-or even reduced pay in difficult circumstances. The tax environment remains, on balance, a downside. Foreign investors, including a rising number of private equity firms, are attracted by the large number of profitable medium-sized companies specialising in niche markets. Additional strengths are the country's good infrastructure, the generally high quality of the workforce, and strong research and innovation activity.
Impact
Foreign-owned companies employ about 2.5m people in Germany. Many FDI inflows take the form of acquisitions rather than greenfield investment, so that the immediate impact on employment is not clear (and in some cases has initially been negative). In industry, especially manufacturing, the dominance of German firms means that FDI has had only a limited impact. Although manufacturing made up 23% of gross value added in 2016, it represented just under 10% of the inward FDI stock. Foreign investment in Germany's services sector is likely to have had a larger impact on the domestic economy, boosting productivity via the introduction of new technology and less hierarchical organisational structures. Investment by private equity groups has also helped to inject capital and managerial expertise into slow-growing family-owned businesses.
Potential
Germany's skilled workforce and sound infrastructure make it a good location for specialised manufacturing. More generally, the structure of German industry is still relatively fragmented, providing foreign investors with the opportunity to participate in sectoral consolidation and to reap economies of scale through acquisitions. The generational changeover at the helm of many small and medium-sized companies provides opportunities for foreign investors, although in many cases foreign involvement is not appreciated. The still moderate level of property prices-by west European standards-and increasing demand for housing, especially in urban areas, may attract investors into this sector. A poor demographic outlook, with the population expected to go into decline by 2022, will constrain Germany's potential as a consumer market. Regulatory barriers to inward investment are likely to increase in the coming years, as political pressure to protect sensitive industries has increased in recent years and broadened from traditional strategic industries, such as defence, to high-tech industries, driven by the desire not to sell technology to future competitors. This is likely to happen both at the European and the domestic levels, and will increasingly lead to delays in approving projects, and larger numbers of rejections of takeovers.

Germany's population fell in every year between 2002 and 2011, but high levels of net immigration underpinned population growth in subsequent years. The population reached 82.8m in 2017, up from 80.5m in 2012, boosted in particular by the impact of the migrant crisis in 2015. The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that the rise in the population will moderate in 2018-22, with the total stabilising at around 82.9m in 2022, before starting to decline.
The population has seen negative natural change ever since reunification
The population has recorded a natural decline in every year since German reunification, with the death rate higher than the birth rate, and this will continue to be the case in 2018-22. The birth rate plummeted after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, especially in East Germany. In 1991 830,019 births were recorded in Germany, but by 2011 this number had fallen to 662,685. More recently, this trend has reversed, with the fertility rate rising to 1.59 children per woman in 2016-the highest figure since 1973-reflecting both policy efforts, such as an expansion in childcare provision and parental benefits, and a higher fertility rate among immigrant communities. Nonetheless, this was still below the EU average of 1.6, and well below the replacement rate of 2.1.
The decline in the population in the early 2000s was caused not just by a fall in the birth rate, but also by negative net immigration. In total, the population contracted by 1%, or about 800,000 people, between 2002 and 2012. However, this trend has now also reversed, with population growth in 2012-17 coming from positive net immigration. This peaked in 2015 during the migrant crisis, when a sharp rise in inflows of migrants and refugees from conflict zones in the Middle East and North Africa were attracted to Germany in particular because of its strong economy and initially welcoming policy stance. However, the sheer volume of arrivals soon proved politically unsustainable, prompting a hardening of the government's position. The influx of migrants slowed in 2016, reflecting the closing of the Balkan route into the EU and an agreement between the EU and Turkey to halt migrants crossing illegally to the bloc from Turkey, brokered by Germany. We expect further deals to be agreed with other countries as needed to ensure that the experience of 2015 is not repeated.
The working-age population will continue to decline
This means that the demographic outlook will remain poor. As in the region more broadly, the population is ageing, with the old-age dependency ratio expected to rise over the forecast period and the working-age population already in decline. We expect the share of the population aged 15-64 to fall from 65.5% in 2017 to 63.9% in 2022. Although these shares remain higher than those in France, the UK or Italy, the rate of decline is faster. This is likely to lead to greater pressure on the pensions and healthcare systems. It will also exacerbate labour shortages, given robust economic activity at present in Germany and an increasingly tight labour market-Germany has the second-lowest unemployment rate in the EU. Efforts have already been made to attract more women and older workers into employment, but there will be diminishing returns from these over the forecast period. Policy innovation will also be needed to attract immigrants into the labour market, and in particular to integrate the recent arrivals from the Middle East and North Africa. Although the current economic upswing and a range of integration programmes are helping with this, full labour market integration is likely to be a long process.
Germany has the second-highest number of immigrants in the world, after the US, with more than 16m first- and second-generation immigrants. The largest groups in 2016 were from Turkey (which is double the size of any other group), Poland, Syria, Italy, Romania and Greece. Aside from a large inflow of migrants from the Middle East and the Balkans in 2015-16, the turnaround in net immigration since 2011 reflects a rise in the number of people migrating to Germany from Poland, Romania and Bulgaria, and to a lesser extent from crisis-hit members of the euro zone, such as Italy and Greece. The economic recovery currently under way across the bloc means that these inflows are now easing, but Brexit may result in some financial services staff moving to Germany, while other immigrations who would otherwise have gone to the UK may start to consider Germany as an alternative option.

Germany will remain the fourth-largest economy in the world in 2022
As measured by GDP at current exchange rates, Germany is the fourth-largest economy in the world, behind the US, China and Japan. According to The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecasts, this will still be the case in 2022, with German GDP standing at US$4.8trn. This is still significantly bigger than the fifth-largest economy in the world on this measure, the UK, which we forecast at US$3.3trn in 2022 (we expect the French economy to be worth US$3.2trn). Germany is the largest economy in Europe, and accounts for just over a fifth of total EU GDP. On a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis, which adjusts for differences in price levels between countries that are not always captured by market exchange rates, the German economy is the fifth largest in the world, behind India, the US, China and Japan.

Consumer demand will rise moderately over the forecast period
Germany is the largest consumer market in the EU in terms of population size. However, GDP per head is only the sixth highest in the EU, and the market for consumer goods is further reduced by an elevated savings rate, a cultural reluctance to buy on credit, the second-highest tax wedge as a percentage of labour costs in the OECD in 2017 (after Belgium) and a low proportion of national income accounted for by wages and salaries. Consumer spending played a relatively modest role in Germany's post-crisis recovery, with private consumption accounting for an average of only 0.1 percentage point of GDP growth in 2007-10, and 0.6 percentage points in 2011-14. However, it has become a more important driver of GDP growth more recently, in line with a strengthening of employment growth, as well as a temporary boost to real incomes from lower oil prices, increases to state pensions and the introduction of a minimum wage in 2015. Collective bargaining arrangements to increase wages in specific industries are now being agreed, and will feed into real earnings growth in 2018-22. This will support consumer spending; but with real personal disposable income forecast to rise by 1.3% per year in 2018-22 compared with 1.6% in 2013-17, demand is likely to moderate over the course of our forecast period.
The shift towards domestic-demand-driven growth in recent years is lending support to housing-related areas of the German economy, with a significant pick-up in house price growth since 2010. We expect this firmer trend in housing market activity to continue, and, combined with the rise in the number of single and two-person households-which now comprise three-quarters of the total-this will support sales of white goods. As in many countries, the profile of bricks-and-mortar retailing is changing owing to the strong growth of online shopping and consumers' increasing demand for convenience. E-commerce sales totalled an estimated EUR48.7bn in 2017, up by 10% from 2016, according to the German Retail Federation (HDE). Meanwhile, traditional mainstays such as bookshops, consumer electronics stores and household appliance chains are disappearing, and department stores are struggling to remain profitable. Reflecting the high market share of discounters, consumers will retain a strong price focus for staples, including food and clothing, but high-end income gains will also sustain demand for luxury goods.
Population ageing will influence spending patterns
Germany is a mature consumer market, but demographic trends will have an important influence on spending patterns over the next few years. The population is ageing, and, according to Germany Trade and Invest, people older than 50 years now account for over half of purchasing power. This brings with it a rising demand for age-related services, particularly in the health sector, and for products-for example, in the tourism industry-that cater specifically for the needs of the elderly. Meanwhile, the increasing awareness in the working-age population that the public pension system will not remain as generous as it is at present will boost demand for retirement savings products in the financial services industry.

Initial conditions: Germany has many attributes that are conducive to sustainable long-term growth, including a highly skilled workforce, good infra-structure and stable institutions. Its economic underperformance prior to the 2008-09 global financial slump was largely the result of deficient con-sumer demand, but also reflected supply-side rigidities in services. The situation in the labour market and wage dynamics indicate that the rebalancing towards consumption-driven growth is set to continue over a multi-year time horizon. The structural shift towards a more services-oriented economy still has further to go in Germany than in many other OECD members, owing to the relatively high share of the manufacturing industry in overall GDP. Growth in services is likely to come from areas connected with the manufacturing sector.
Demographic trends: The Economist Intelligence Unit expects negative demographic trends in the coming decades, with the total population set to shrink by 0.12% per year on average in 2018-50, and the working-age population set to decline at an even more rapid rate of 0.56% per year. The tightening of conditions for long-term unemployment benefits has increased the incentive to search for employment, and additional measures in the same direction are likely in the long term. The partial reversal of previous plans to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 between 2012 and 2029 will add to demographic challenges, although we expect some relief to come from increased participation of older workers. Immigration from central and eastern Europe could make a modest contribution to alleviating labour shortages, and further liberalisation of immigration rules for highly skilled workers from non-EU countries is possible. The large-scale immigration from the Middle East and Africa seen in 2015 has provided a temporary boost for the demographic outlook, but integrating a significant percentage of the newcomers into productive parts of the economy is likely to be a process that spans decades.
External conditions: As an export-oriented country, Germany benefits from the broadly liberal world trade order. Generally, it suffers less than other developed countries (for example, Italy) from competition from emerging markets, such as China and India, owing to its specialisation in high-technology capital goods. This specialisation will also allow Germany to benefit from strong demand from these countries as they upgrade their capital stock. However, over the longer term German output will come under more pressure as manufacturers in emerging markets become more sophisticated and challenge German producers head on in high-end merchandise goods. Within the EU the liberalisation of trade in services should continue (albeit slowly). A worsening of the global trading environment and increased protectionism represent a significant risk to Germany, given its open economy.
Institutions and policy trends: Germany's low growth in the early 2000s focused the minds of politicians and policymakers on the need for economic reforms, many of which were implemented, along with more flexible bargaining about wages and other working conditions. Our expectation is that national and EU initiatives will continue to strengthen competition, but there is a risk that the recent loss of faith in market-based solutions will persist. Under the previous government there were already signs that the reforms that have underpinned strong growth in recent years were being partly reversed. Although the public finances are currently in a healthy state, further reform is needed to make them sustainable in the long term. Little movement in this direction, for instance via reform of the pension system, is currently in sight, and we expect policymaking to continue to be slow. This will start posing a drag on growth in the first half of our long-term forecast period.
Long-term performance: Our forecast of the economy's long-term average annual growth rate is 1.4%, with a slowdown from 1.6% in the first half of the forecast period (to 2030) to 1.2% in the second half. A contraction of the working-age population is a major driver of this weakening overall growth rate. Accordingly, the picture looks slightly more favourable on a per-head basis, with growth of real GDP per head averaging 1.5% throughout the forecast period, broadly in line with growth since reunification in 1990. GDP per head in 2050 will therefore be around US$141,380, marginally behind Norway and the Netherlands but ahead of Denmark and Finland. GDP per head in the UK and France will remain smaller, at US$112,250 and US$110,900 respectively. In terms of the size of the German economy overall, we expect it to be overtaken by India in the 2030s, making it the fifth largest in the world by 2050. Although productivity growth in Germany will be almost as strong as in the US, the less favourable demographic outlook means that the real economy will go from 22% the size of its US counterpart in 2017 to 18% in 2050.
Long-term outlook: Long-term trends
Climate change and sustainability
Germany claims to be a global leader in tackling climate change, and its Energiewende, or energy transition, focuses on expanding renewables generation. This effort has been comparatively successful, with renewables accounting for 38% of the country's power supply in 2017, and rising to 42% in January-April 2018. However, Germany is still dependent on coal, one of the most polluting fossil fuels, which accounted for just over 40% of total power generation in 2017.
Germany is seeking to cut emissions by 40% from 1990 levels by 2020, 55% by 2030 and by at least 80% by 2050. These ambitious targets have been made more difficult by the 2011 decision to phase out nuclear power, a low-carbon source of energy that at the time accounted for over 20% of generation. Germany's emissions have fallen over the past decade, but only incrementally, with very modest cuts in emissions in the power sector largely negated by slight increases in other sectors, such as transport and manufacturing, and more recently by stronger economic growth.
Efforts to mitigate climate change, including by increasing the share of renewables in the country's energy mix, will remain a government priority over the medium to long term, and we expect public support to be maintained-even in the face of rising electricity prices. Germany's high technological level and self-perception as a global leader in this area will support progress in reducing emissions, and The Economist Intelligence Unit is cautiously optimistic about the long-term outlook, even if the 2020 target is likely to be missed.
The country's exposure to the impact of climate change, meanwhile, will remain comparatively low, given its geographical position-with limited coastal areas-and temperate climate. We expect the government to remain willing and able to provide the infrastructure upgrades necessary in the face of more extreme weather patterns in the future. However, the country's heavy reliance on exports-which we expect to reach 50% of GDP by 2020-and on imports means that supply-chain risk may increase as other countries on which it depends are affected.
Technological developments
Technological advancements will have a significant effect on Germany over the long term for a number of reasons. First, the share of manufacturing in GDP is much higher in Germany than in most other developed European countries, with industry accounting for just over 30% of the economy. According to the OECD, along with agriculture, manufacturing is the industry most exposed to automation globally. In general, the OECD found that jobs in Germany (as in central and eastern Europe, and Japan) were easier to automate than those in the UK, US, Nordic countries and the Netherlands.
Second, Germany is typically strong at research and development (R&D), and innovation, which could make a transition to higher automation rates both more likely and quicker. In 2016 Germany spent EUR1,125 per head on R&D, according to Eurostat, the fourth-highest level in the EU, and almost double the average for the bloc. In 2017 33,425 patents were filed in Germany, the fourth-highest level in the world after the US, Japan and China, according to the European Patent Office.
Third, Germany is already starting from a strong position. Of the countries looked at in a recent report by the International Federation of Robotics, Germany had the highest density of industrial robots in the manufacturing industry in Europe, and the third highest in the world after South Korea and Singapore. Germany's ratio of 309 industrial robots per 10,000 workers was more than double that of France (132). Its stock of industrial robots was 41% of the European total in 2016.
Germany is already working to increase automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies as part of its Industry 4.0 strategy, and efforts to embed new technologies across the industrial sector will continue over the long term. This is likely to be disruptive for the automotive sector in particular, as e-mobility gains pace and autonomous vehicles are further developed, and as diesel technologies are gradually phased out. It is also likely to prove difficult for the Mittelstand, the often family-owned small and medium-sized enterprises found across the country that are central to Germany's manufacturing prowess, as they may struggle to acquire the digital skills needed to compete with new challengers. Efforts to make these firms more resilient to digital disruption will gain pace in 2018-50. Although the country will not supplant the US as a leader in innovation, adoption of new technology will be consistently strong.

Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts
The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections
The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables
The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include:
LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings
As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth
The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model
Outline of the model
The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines ten separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, and infrastructure. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2013-17) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2018-22). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2013-17. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2018-22 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings
The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2013-17 ranges are then used to derive 2018-22 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues
The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2018-22, not to the likely situation in 2022 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2015 or 2020). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Abstract: [...]he led the ÖVP to a plurality of the vote in the early election on October 15th, winning a 31.5% share-up by 7.5 percentage points on its result in 2013.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
An early election in October 2017 was won by the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), led by the young minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, who has since become chancellor at the head of a majority coalition government of the ÖVP and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to last a full term.
The inclusion of the FPÖ in the government will not lead to significant tensions with other EU member states, as it did in 2000, when the party was last part of a coalition. This is largely because of the normalisation of the far right in Europe since then.
We expect the new government to focus on integration and immigration policy, and to attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and introduce some additional flexibility in labour and product markets. Significant structural reforms are unlikely due to low government cohesion.
We forecast that the government budget will remain in deficit, albeit well within the EU-mandated limit of 3% of GDP, throughout the 2018-22 forecast period, as the fiscal consolidation process is likely to be restrained by limited government cohesion and effectiveness. The public debt/GDP ratio will fall gradually, to just above 67% by 2022, from an estimated 78.4% in 2017.
After several years of underperformance compared with its regional peers, the economy has performed relatively strongly since the start of 2016, growing by 3.1% in 2017. We forecast a continuation of strong growth this year, at 2.5%, and for growth to moderate to 1.7% on average in 2019-22.
Consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) will continue to exceed the euro zone average in 2018-22, driven by structural domestic factors including higher unit wage costs and more regulated markets. We expect annual average EU harmonised inflation of 2% in 2018-22.
The current-account surplus has been relatively stable in recent years, at about 2%. Although we expect small changes in the composition of the surplus, we expect it to remain stable overall, at 2% of GDP on average in 2018-22, driven mainly by a strong surplus on the services balance, supported by tourism inflows.

Austria's business environment score rises between the historical period (2013-17) and the forecast period (2018-22), mainly owing to the improving economy. Austria's strengths as a business location include good infrastructure, stable institutions and co-operative labour relations, but high taxes, limited market opportunities and restrictive regulations will persist.
Country forecast overview: Austria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government works on reducing red tape, but progress is likely to be limited.
2020-22: Modest strengthening of competition authority's powers. Administrative reform reduces red tape. More transparency in antitrust proceedings. Risk of political interference in private firms in which state owns substantial stakes.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Foreign investment is generally welcome, but underlying opposition to takeovers of "national champions" persists.
2020-22: Possible erosion of barriers against foreign takeovers as a result of commercial pressure and EU legislation.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: No exchange controls. Foreign trade, governed by EU rules, should remain liberal.
2020-22: EU maintains focus on bilateral free-trade agreements as multilateral trade negotiations stagnate.
Taxes
2018-19: Limited changes to the tax system aimed at reducing the sizeable income tax wedge.
2020-22: Vested interests will continue to hamper large-scale reform, and the high tax burden will remain.
Financing
2018-19: Financial stability to improve amid tighter regulatory requirements and a reduction in risk from exposure to central and eastern Europe.
2020-22: Further uptake in corporate bond issuance. Credit conditions continue to ease as banks' profitability recovers, in part supported by a gradual uptick in interest rates.
The labour market
2018-19: Economy-wide minimum wage introduced. More stringent requirements for early retirement and invalidity pensions. Labour market slowly improves as increase in labour supply moderates and unemployment continues to fall.
2020-22: Continued modest expansion of labour supply, primarily via net immigration, but concerns about shortage of skilled employees in certain sectors are likely to persist. Early retirement phased out.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Further take-up of broadband services. Gradual improvement of transport links with eastern Europe.
2020-22: Improved transport network connecting main urban centres and providing better access to the country's interior. Gradual transition to low-carbon economy entails significant changes to electricity transmission infrastructure
Technological readiness
2018-19: Internet use remains slightly below regional peers, but research and development remains relatively high.
2020-22: Further progress is made on upgrading the large manufacturing sector to take advantage of new technologies.

Background: Austria became an important force in central Europe with the formation of the Habsburg empire in the 15th century and remained so until the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the first world war. The Republic of Austria emerged in 1918. In 1938 Austria was incorporated into the German Third Reich. With the departure of the victorious Allied forces in 1955, it regained independence as a neutral country. In the post-war period Austria took great strides to catch up economically with the rest of the developed world and is now one of the most advanced nations. It is a member of the EU and a participant in the economic and monetary union (EMU).
Political structure: Austria is a federal republic and the head of state is the federal president. The government is led by the federal chancellor. The national parliament has two houses: the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house), of 62 members appointed by state parliaments, and the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house), which has 183 members elected by proportional representation. An early general election was held on October 15th 2017.
Policy issues: The government will focus on migration and integration issues, including in the EU context. It will also attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and implement other measures to improve the business environment, including through enabling more flexibility in the labour market.
Taxation: Austrian labour tax as a percentage of GDP is among the highest in the EU. A 2016 tax reform lowered the tax burden for low- and middle-income earners, but raised the top personal income tax rate from 50% to 55%. Social security contributions, shared between employers and employees, are high. Corporation tax is levied at a rate of 25%. Dividend and investment income is subject to a withholding tax of 27.5%. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a standard rate of 20%, and a reduced rate of 13% (raised from 10% in 2016) applies for certain goods and services.
Foreign trade: Trade relations are dominated by Germany, which accounts for about a third of total imports and exports. The current-account surplus is driven by strong tourism exports boosting the services surplus. We expect modest current-account surpluses throughout the forecast period.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
In May 2017, after several years of little progress on reforms, and coalition-as well as party-in-fighting, the grand coalition of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) fell apart. The popular 31-year-old minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, took over the leadership of the ÖVP, reformed the party around himself and moved it closer to the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) on issues such as immigration and integration. As a result, he led the ÖVP to a plurality of the vote in the early election on October 15th, winning a 31.5% share-up by 7.5 percentage points on its result in 2013. The SPÖ's vote share was unchanged, at 26.9%. The FPÖ increased its share of the vote by 5.5 percentage points, to 26%. The liberal NEOS returned to parliament with just over 5% of the vote, and the Greens failed to cross the 4% electoral threshold for the first time in 31 years, in part because List Pilz, led by a former leader of the Greens, narrowly managed to cross it.
In mid-December, after just over a month and a half of negotiations, the ÖVP and the FPÖ formed a coalition. Under Mr Kurz the ÖVP has moved closer to the FPÖ in many policy areas, and the negotiations thus went relatively smoothly. In order to assuage concerns from Mr Kurz and the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, about the FPÖ's previous Euroscepticism, the party has agreed not to push for a referendum on EU membership. Moreover, EU policy is handled by the chancellery instead of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is headed by an FPÖ appointee.
Although the chancellor is from the ÖVP, the election should still be seen as a further step in the fraying of the decades-long dominance of the political scene by the SPÖ and the ÖVP, as the ÖVP has, to a large extent, been replaced by Mr Kurz's new movement. The two parties had together ruled the country almost continuously since 1945, but a renewed grand coalition had become almost impossible following the breakdown of relations between them and the reform gridlock in recent years. The FPÖ has profited both from this and from concerns about immigration, although Mr Kurz also owes much of his popularity to his strong stance on this issue and his plans to curtail migration into Europe and Austria.
Despite the overlap between the ÖVP's and the FPÖ's programmes, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect the government to implement significant structural reforms, as the coalition partners are likely to disagree on economic matters, on which they are significantly less well aligned than they are on social and cultural matters. In addition, the FPÖ could struggle to translate its opposition stance on topics such as immigration and integration into concrete policy proposals, owing in part to internal party upheaval. The initial phase of the government's term is likely to be relatively smooth, owing in part to the country's role as president of the Council of the European Union in the second half of 2018. Later in the term the FPÖ might struggle to distinguish itself from the ÖVP, which could lead to tensions between the parties, creating a moderate risk of an early election.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
The last general election was held on October 15th 2017. Unless the government falls before then, it will sit in the Nationalrat (the lower house of parliament) until the end of its term in late 2022. The next election for the primarily ceremonial post of federal president will be in 2022.
Three elections for state parliaments have already been held so far in 2018, with one more planned, in Salzburg. These tend to be fought on local issues and give only a limited view of national political developments. Nevertheless, the FPÖ's recent underperformance in Carinthia could push it to take stronger stances at the national level.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Austria was severely affected by the European migrant crisis, and this has been the dominant issue in its domestic politics and international relations since 2015. The country has been at the centre of many of the intra-EU spats regarding the bloc's response to the large influx of migrants, owing in part to its unilateral actions, including the leading role that it played in closing the migration route through the Balkans. Domestic pressure on the government to be seen as acting against this inflow, and thus often against other EU member states, will remain high. The new government plans to cut child benefit payments flowing abroad, potentially leading to tensions with eastern member states in particular.
Nevertheless, Mr Kurz has been at pains to point out that his government will be pro-EU, and that Austria's EU membership will not be questioned in the coming years. The government plans for Austria to be a leading voice in the bloc in the coming years, especially on migration reform, which should be facilitated by the country's role as president of the Council of the European Union. We expect the government to find broad support for proposals such as tighter controls of the EU's outer borders and processing asylum applications outside the EU.
Although the previous inclusion of the FPÖ in government following the 1999 election led to sanctions being imposed by other EU nations in 2000, the reception has been more muted this time. At that time a far-right nationalist party entering government was an unusual development, but since then sister parties to the FPÖ have either entered government or supported minority governments in several EU countries, including some Nordic countries and the Netherlands. However, this will at times lead to tensions with fellow EU members, as shown by decreased intelligence sharing with Austria by a number of countries owing to the FPÖ heading the relevant ministries.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
The new govern-ment plans to move integration and immigration policy further to the right, including through curtailing benefits for asylum-seekers and cutting child benefits sent abroad. It has also presented plans that focus on improving the business environment, including by reducing corporate tax rates and introducing more flexibility for working hours. Furthermore, it plans to cut a number of labour market programmes aimed at the long-term unemployed and integrating migrants into the labour market. However, it does not plan to reform the country's so-called Proporz system, under which the ÖVP and the SPÖ had apportioned public life-state companies, public services, subsidies, regulatory responsibilities-despite suggestions from both coalition parties in the past, especially from the FPÖ, that they would want to do this. We therefore expect reform momentum to be limited and for the government to struggle to implement significant structural reforms rapidly.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Driven by both a lacklustre recovery in the wake of the financial and euro zone crises, and by a lack of fiscal consolidation, the fiscal accounts have remained in modest deficit in recent years and within the 3% of GDP limit set by the EU. Strong growth contributed to a narrowing of the deficit to an estimated 0.7% of GDP in 2017.
The government plans to reach a small budget surplus in 2019 by cutting spending and at the same time reducing income taxes and the country's sizeable tax wedge. However, it has not yet clearly outlined the spending cuts that it intends to make, barring a number of smaller measures including cutting spending on asylum-seekers, and we therefore do not share the government's optimism that a surplus can be reached in 2019. Nevertheless, continued robust economic growth will contribute to a further narrowing of the deficit in the coming years; we expect it to average only 0.3% of GDP in 2018-22.
The public debt stock as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline gradually, from an estimated 78.4% in 2017 to just above 67% in 2022. Although the public finances will remain worse than in peers such as Germany or the Netherlands, the low-interest-rate environment and Austria's relatively strong fundamentals mean that funding risks are extremely low, in our view.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The European Central Bank (ECB) is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a quantitative easing (QE) programme that ran at EUR60bn per month until the end of 2017, and is running at EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018. However, the ECB's view of the outlook improved markedly during 2017 and, although it remains dovish, we expect a more upbeat tone to emerge this year, and an end to monthly asset purchases under the QE programme at the end of 2018. Rising commodity prices and evidence of building domestic price pressure in some parts of the euro zone should mean that sufficient inflationary pressures will begin to emerge on the policy horizon in 2019-20. In response, we expect the ECB to take steps towards normalising its policy stance with an increase of 25 basis points in the main refinancing rate, to 0.25%, in early 2020, followed by five more rises that lift the main refinancing rate to 1.5% by end-2022. An increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019, easing the pressure on banks' lending margins and supporting profitability.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Austria's initial recovery from the global financial crisis was respectable in the euro zone context, but subsequently the economy largely stalled and under-performed in comparison with regional peers, notably Germany. This was particularly striking given the traditionally high level of synchronisation between the two countries' business cycles. A faltering reform process in recent years contributed to higher inflation compared with regional peers and weakened productivity growth, admittedly from fairly high levels. However, the economic recovery gained significant momentum from the second half of 2016. Although in previous years the labour market had struggled to integrate the significant increase in the labour force, it seemed to have turned a corner in late 2016 and early 2017, owing in part to a surge in employment in the manufacturing sector. We expect a continued gradual improvement in labour market indicators in the coming years. This is supporting private consumption, which we expect to grow by 1.8% this year. Export and investment growth have also picked up. As a result, real GDP growth was 3.1% in 2017-above growth in Germany for the first time since 2005 and Austria's fastest growth rate since 2007.
We expect the current phase of catch-up growth-following an under-performance even compared with fundamentals in recent years-to continue this year, although we forecast slower growth, at 2.5%, as we expect the impulse from the manufacturing sector in 2017 to have largely been a one-off. In the following years we expect a further moderation of growth, to around its potential growth rate. Driven by the improvement of the labour market, domestic demand will be the main driver of growth. We expect average real GDP growth of 1.7% in 2019-22. Government policy is likely to be supportive of growth in the coming years, and the main risks are external. As a highly open economy, Austria is vulnerable to global economic developments, including any shocks to global trade in the case of a potential trade war between the US and the EU.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Annual consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) has been subdued in recent years, but higher than in most other euro zone countries. Inflation averaged 0.9% in 2015-16-well above average inflation in Germany and the euro zone. This largely reflects structural domestic factors such as higher unit wage costs, more regulated markets, and a period of faster increases in taxes and duties. Rising services prices and energy price base effects fostered a gradual increase in inflation in 2017, leading to a full-year average of 2.2%. The recent strengthening of the euro will weigh slightly on inflation, but we expect price growth to stay above the euro zone average in 2018-22, at 2% on average, as similar structural factors seen in previous years persist.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
For most of 2015-16 the euro moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1, before a sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following the presidential election in the US led to a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1. However, in 2017 the euro rallied as the region's economic recovery strengthened and expectations of QE tapering increased, and as political risk waned in Europe but rose in the US. The exchange rate peaked at almost US$1.25:EUR1 at the beginning of February 2018 and has stabilised just below this level in March-April. The value of the euro could yet come under pressure from political risk-especially in the wake of the March 2018 general election in Italy-and monetary tightening in the US. Nevertheless, we expect a gradual appreciation on average, to US$1.21:EUR1 by 2020-21, as the euro is supported by an ongoing recovery in the region and receives structural support from a large current-account surplus, while the business cycle downturn in the US will weigh on the value of the dollar in 2020. Thereafter we expect the euro to appreciate to US$1.24:EUR1 on average in 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
Low oil prices and subdued domestic demand compressing import values helped the trade balance to move into surplus in recent years, from a deficit in 2009-13. However, the increase in oil prices in 2017 pushed it back into modest deficit. We expect the trade account to remain around balance, but in deficit, throughout the forecast period. The main driver of the current-account surplus will therefore be the healthy surplus on the services balance, driven in large part by robust tourist inflows. This will ensure that the current-account surplus remains broadly flat throughout 2018-22, at 2% of GDP on average.

Abstract: [...]neither path is likely to lend the regime international legitimacy and unlock the foreign financing needed to stabilise both the economy and PDVSA. [...]we believe that the most likely outcome is a "mixed administration", in which pragmatically minded military and PSUV leaders allow opposition participation as a way of gaining international legitimacy. [...]to gain international and local legitimacy, a mixed administration would have to restore civic freedoms and release political prisoners, something that the PSUV side may not abide; furthermore, if such steps are taken, they may increase instability. [...]wastefulness at state-owned firms and massive corruption and clientelism schemes built around the delivery of subsidised goods and services would be hard to roll back without antagonising administration backers, risking political instability. [...]we would expect a mixed administration to focus on macroeconomic essentials, such as the stabilisation of the currency and local prices, and tackling mismanagement of PDVSA. [...]we expect extremely limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will limit economic recovery and fuel continued unrest.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
The regime of the president, Nicolás Maduro, will strengthen its grip on power following the installation of a Constituent Assembly in 2017 and presidential elections, widely expected to be rigged, this coming May. However, economic collapse and the erosion of the patronage scheme supporting the government will put the regime's internal cohesion in jeopardy. We expect a traumatic rift that will end in regime pragmatists allowing opposition participation in a "mixed administration" as a way to remain in power from 2019 onwards. There is a risk that the regime will retain cohesion and cling to power beyond 2019 if it finds financing to meet its debt obligations and boost dwindling oil production.
We estimate that inflation exceeded 2,000% at the end of 2017 and will average over 10,000% in 2018. GDP will continue to contract in 2018-20. High inflation has led to a collapse in private consumption, and difficult operating conditions have hurt investment. Following a change in policy under a new government, we expect economic growth to resume in 2021.
The business environment is among the weakest in the world, reflecting outright hostility from the government towards the private sector as well as critical shortages of inputs needed to maintain productive capacity. From 2019 a new government will stabilise the economy, but the wholesale rethink of the institutional framework needed to restore investment and confidence is unlikely.
Worsening shortages of consumer goods and quadruple-digit inflation will hit private consumption, and an increasingly difficult operating environment will accentuate the fall in fixed investment. The recession that began in 2014 will continue to deepen despite a partial recovery in oil prices, and the economy will not return to growth until 2021-assuming that a new government takes power and implements reforms. However, these reforms will take time to bear fruit, reinforcing our forecasts of only a weak recovery.
US dollar measurements of Venezuela's market size provide an overly positive picture of the economy, given the marked overvaluation of the fixed exchange rate. In reality, recession and extremely high inflation (driven by shortages of foreign exchange and basic goods) will continue to restrict purchasing power. After 2020, under a new government, we expect purchasing power and the business environment to improve.

Venezuela is in 80th position globally in The Economist Intelligence Unit business environment rankings for 2018-22, out of 82 countries covered, making it one of the least attractive investment locations in the world. This reflects the highly heterodox macroeconomic policies of an authoritarian government, a lack of legal security and weak institutions.
Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government persists with bias against free markets and ad hoc recourse to heterodox measures. Nationalisation poses a diminished threat, given fiscal weaknesses. Property rights remain weak. Price fixing undermines profitability.
2020-22: Gradual improvement in contract rights and the burden of red tape under a new government, as well as a decline in ad hoc interventionism.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Access to project financing is difficult and uncertainty over contractual rights persists.
2020-22: Efforts to attract foreign investment gather pace under a new government, although actual investment flows remain fairly low amid probable economic instability. Intellectual property protection and private property rights improve.
Foreign trade and exchange control
2018-19: Unorthodox exchange-rate policy framework adds to uncertainty. The state continues to exercise tight control over access to official-rate US dollars. New government in 2019 removes exchange controls.
2020-22: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, owing to the risk of economic dislocation. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves only very slowly.
Taxes
2018-19: Risk of further unrest and political stability reduces the probability of tax increases, despite the huge fiscal deficit. Severity of economic crisis precludes major public spending increases.
2020-22: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but the risk of discriminatory ad hoc tax measures falls.
Financing
2018-19: Banks remain profitable, but monetary distortions and a weak regulatory framework heighten instability.
2020-22: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid sustainable growth in credit to the private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market
2018-19: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage labour costs. An ongoing freeze on redundancies, combined with a large informal sector and skill shortages, makes the labour market exceptionally rigid.
2020-22: Labour market rigidities persist, despite some increase in the flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Access to water and electricity supplies remains precarious. Underinvestment in power transmission ensures that rationing and unpredictable blackouts remain a cause for concern.
2020-22: Private-sector investment starts to pick up, but there is a risk of continued electricity rationing.
Technological readiness
2018-19: E-government services remain almost non-existent and deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies.
2020-22: Limited regulator capacity and years of underinvestment continue to limit internet and mobile coverage.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties, Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente, alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in their support, culminating in the election in 1998 of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but he survived several attempts to remove him from power. Mr Chávez was diagnosed with cancer in 2011 but, after declaring in July 2012 that he had fully recovered, won a fourth presidential term in October 2012. However, his health quickly deteriorated and he died in March 2013. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, won a presidential election in April 2013, but his popularity has since plummeted.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is a federal republic, successive administrations have proven reluctant to devolve political authority, with the transfer of financial resources from federal to local level highly dependent on the central government. The legislature is unicameral, and elections for the National Assembly take place every five years. In December 2015 the opposition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática won control of the legislature. In August 2017 the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) installed a Constituent Assembly with powers over all branches of government and a remit to rewrite the 1999 Constitution-apparently a ploy to entrench the PSUV in power.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is how to stabilise an economy mired in a years-long economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. At the same time, mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign-exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 60% for oil firms. Since 2011 a maximum royalty of 95% has applied to oil extraction. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: Using IMF data, we estimate that the merchandise trade surplus rose to US$21.1bn in 2017 amid massive import compression and acute foreign-exchange shortages. We estimate the current-account surplus at 1.3% of GDP that year.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
Despite a decimated economy and spiralling hyperinflation, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) and the president, Nicolás Maduro, retain their hold on power. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects worsening economic conditions to result in a chaotic political transition, most likely ushering in a government with nominal opposition participation-a "mixed administration"-in 2019.
The opposition, of which the Mesa de la Unidad Democrática (MUD) is the biggest grouping, remains in disarray. Apart from infighting, this reflects the PSUV's systematic campaign to disfranchise opposition parties and sideline them from state institutions. After years of ineffectual leadership, most citizens, even those opposing the PSUV, distrust opposition parties. This has left them incapable of channelling the anti-government sentiment brewing in response to the country's dire economic situation.
In this context of unrest and repression, the PSUV is increasingly dependent on the military for support. In effect, a civic-military alliance runs the country. In addition to ideological sensibilities, the accord is sustained by opportunities for arbitrage and corruption schemes made possible by foreign-exchange controls; subsidised imports of basic goods; and control of large and inefficient public-sector companies. The ultimate source of resources flowing through this patronage train is PDVSA, the state-owned oil company, whose exports account for the vast majority of Venezuela's foreign-exchange inflows.
Jeopardising the arrangement is the fact that oil production is declining rapidly owing to mismanagement and underinvestment at PDVSA. Resultant strains have been exposed by purges of the military-the latest coming in March. Unless the administration turns PDVSA around (something we see as unlikely, as the government cannot finance the required investment), we believe that the patronage system supporting Mr Maduro will be at risk of collapse by late 2018 or early 2019.
What happens next is hard to predict, given the military's involvement in government and the opposition's weakness. The transition is likely to be violent. An outright military government is a possibility, as is internal re-organisation, with PSUV civilian figureheads fronting a military-heavy administration. However, neither path is likely to lend the regime international legitimacy and unlock the foreign financing needed to stabilise both the economy and PDVSA. Therefore, we believe that the most likely outcome is a "mixed administration", in which pragmatically minded military and PSUV leaders allow opposition participation as a way of gaining international legitimacy. Given the historical record, there should be no shortage of opposition figures willing to participate. Indeed, Henri Falcón-the only opposition figure of relevance running in the May 20th presidential election-is running on a "mixed administration" platform.
The election introduces the risk that our forecast "mixed administration" may be ushered into power before 2019. This is because the elections may trigger US sanctions on the oil trade. As the US is PDVSA's largest cash-paying market, such sanctions would hasten the erosion of the patronage regime. Similarly, arrears on bonded debt may lead to asset seizures in the US that impede trade, but the timing and extent of such seizures is uncertain, as no legal action has been started yet.
Regardless of its timing, our forecast shift to a mixed administration will face challenges. The PSUV's internal stability is a concern, as the end of the current regime is likely to unleash competition within the PSUV between factions that will jostle for prominence. Secondly, to gain international and local legitimacy, a mixed administration would have to restore civic freedoms and release political prisoners, something that the PSUV side may not abide; furthermore, if such steps are taken, they may increase instability. Although foreign financing should be forthcoming, it would underpin a macroeconomic programme that-by fixing the economy's distortions-would close avenues for corruption and upset regime insiders, another destabilising pitfall. Other hurdles of uncertain size will remain. These include the judiciary, the de facto legislature that is the Constituent Assembly, and the colectivos, a cross between PSUV paramilitaries and community organisers.
Overall, we expect a chaotic transition starting in late 2018 or early 2019. The process will be highly uncertain and may feature several false starts. We expect curtailed political stability in 2019-22.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
Elections for the presidency and municipal and state legislatures are scheduled for May 20th. Most of the opposition are either banned or boycotting the elections in protest of the rigged electoral process. Mr Falcón, a former MUD and PSUV member, is courting regime pragmatists to facilitate his victory by offering a path to a "mixed administration" scenario, promising to secure international financing while simultaneously promising "national reconcili-ation".
However, Mr Falcón must secure international and local legitimacy in order to show regime pragmatists that he is a credible alternative to Mr Maduro, something that he is yet to do. Mr Falcón is rumoured to be enticing the rest of the opposition to abandon their boycott by offering to secure new electoral guarantees. We do not foresee success in those negotiations, as the current boycott stems from failed MUD-PSUV negotiations on electoral rules. However, further electoral postponements may take place, as the regime may fear further international sanctions following rigged elections. Following the installation of the "mixed administration", we expect an electoral timetable to be announced, as international financing will almost surely come with demands for democratic elections.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Most regional governments have denounced the Venezuelan government; the Summit of the Americas, held in the Peruvian capital, Lima, in April, brought further isolation, although it produced no concrete sanctions. The most effective sanctions have come from the US, which has instituted country-level sanctions that deny Venezuela the possibility of refinancing its debts. Oil sanctions are not part of our baseline assumption, but the new foreign policy team in the US introduces risks to this forecast, increasing the possibility of sanctions following the May 20th elections. A key priority for the Maduro administration will be the maintenance of good relations with Russia and China. Both have provided financing in the past, but seem unwilling to provide the several billions of dollars needed to stem the decline of oil output.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
The government remains unable and unwilling to undertake the policy changes needed to address its main challenges, namely declining oil production, spiralling hyperinflation and mounting arrears on external debt. Most sovereign and state-owned firms' bonds (including those of PDVSA) are now in arrears, but the government maintains it has not defaulted, despite calling for a debt restructuring. This appears impossible owing to US financial sanctions and, more fundamentally, because the government lacks a credible economic programme. There is no sign yet of lawsuits by bondholders, who so far appear to prefer the promise of late payment to lengthy legal battles. Investors may also be waiting for news of policy changes following the May election or a change in country leadership. In the meantime, the country remains open to legal challenges in the US. This is especially concerning in the case of PDVSA, as it could involve seizure of assets, including Citgo, a PDVSA subsidiary, which could impede exports, the regime's economic lifeline. In the meantime, the government must also grapple with a build-up of huge inflationary and currency depreciation pressures. Monetisation of large public deficits and dwindling exports has led to foreign currency rationing and hyperinflation. In line with our expectations, the government undertook a maxi-devaluation in February 2018, but monetary imbalances persist and foreign-exchange continues to be rationed. Economic policy will remain unsustainable, and ad hoc policy intervention and heavy state control of the economy will persist.
Under our baseline scenario of a "mixed administration", we expect more orthodox economic policies to be implemented. However, such an admini-stration would have considerable internal limitations in addressing key policy challenges. For example, wastefulness at state-owned firms and massive corruption and clientelism schemes built around the delivery of subsidised goods and services would be hard to roll back without antagonising administration backers, risking political instability. Thus, we would expect a mixed administration to focus on macroeconomic essentials, such as the stabilisation of the currency and local prices, and tackling mismanagement of PDVSA.
We assume that macroeconomic stabilisation will be facilitated by financing from the IMF and multilaterals (totalling US$19bn in 2019-22) and the restruct-uring of the government's debt obligations. Meanwhile, PDVSA must open itself to foreign investment to secure the finance needed to bring output back on track. This will require considerable political capital, as it would imply a wholesale revision of the sector's institutional framework. Pockets of resistance are likely to exist. Internal stability within the PSUV will remain a major risk to our forecast, as the success of a mixed administration would depend on PSUV pragmatists fending-off more radical party members, who would oppose accepting international assistance and reforming policy.
Outside of these areas, we do not expect much success in rolling back the PSUV's strong interventionist bent in the economy. As a result, we expect extremely limited real investment inflows, the vast majority going into the oil sector, which will limit economic recovery and fuel continued unrest.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Authorities have not published data on fiscal accounts since 2011, when the non-financial public-sector (NFPS) deficit was 12% of GDP. We forecast an NFPS deficit of 15.5% of GDP in 2018, which will be financed by printing money. High inflation and the overvalued official exchange make debt/GDP ratios misleading indicators of fiscal stability. Considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing (mainly in the form of debt issued by PDVSA and development funds from China) understates the true size of total public liabilities.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect a restructuring with external creditors in 2020. Owing to the need to maintain political stability, we do not expect the closure of the various handout programmes in operation, nor the removal of utility subsidies or the reformation of inefficient state-owned firms. Therefore, we expect public expenditure to be hard to reduce; we expect the deficit to be substantial throughout the 2018-22 period, ending 2022 at 6.9% GDP.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
Monetary policy under the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) will continue to be driven by the government's financing needs, forcing the BCV to print money. Money supply (M2) rose by 3,000% year on year in March. The government has announced that it will take three zeroes of the currency, but has not announced any change in policy. We expect a new administration to place a much greater emphasis on tackling hyperinflation, and expect a substantial monetary adjustment in the context of a macroeconomic stabilisation plan.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Amid ongoing disruption to Venezuela's productive base and a collapse in consumer spending, we project further contractions in real GDP in 2018-20, following an estimated contraction of 13.9% in 2017. Our forecast recovery in 2021-22 rests on an assumption of a political transition that, supported by IMF financial and institutional assistance, produces a credible macroeconomic programme with improved management of the country's oil wealth at its centre. However, the reform programme will be limited in scope by a weak government, and we only expect a partial rebound in real GDP, following a decline of over 50% in 2013-20.
Private consumption will continue to contract in 2018, reflecting the effect on real wages of hyperinflation as well as government compression of imports, which account for a large share of consumer goods. Fixed investment will continue to contract as well, reflecting the difficulty in accessing imported inputs and foreign exchange, and remitting profits. Our forecast for a recovery in investment later in the forecast period assumes a political transition and a pickup in investment, which will be focused in the oil sector. Oil output-already in the midst of a long decline owing to mismanagement and underinvestment-has contracted beyond expectations in recent months; we now expect it to bottom out at 1.2m barrels/day (b/d) in early 2020, down from an average of 1.95m b/d in 2017. Under our baseline forecast of openness to foreign investment under a new government from around 2019, oil production will start a recovery in the second half of 2020, but will remain below 2m b/d even at the end of our forecast period in 2022. Export volumes will only start to recover in 2021, as an increase in domestic demand, which has been artificially constrained, will initially absorb the increase in oil output. For the same reason, import demand will rise sharply.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
A decimation of domestic supply, severe limits on imports and the monetisation of large public deficits have led to hyperinflation. Official data have not been published since 2015, but the opposition-led National Assembly has estimated that monthly inflation was 84% in January, bringing year-on-year inflation to over 4,000%. We expect inflation to average over 10,000% in 2018. There is a high risk of a hyperinflationary spiral in coming months that increases inflation to well above our current forecast and necessitates a dramatic adjustment, probably involving a resort to currency substitution.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
In February the government announced that the Dicom system, a heavily managed auction platform, would be used by both the private and public sectors. The news came with a massive currency devaluation, to BsF24,898:US$, from the previous BsF3,445:US$1. However, the government-which mono-polises the country's exports-has not supplied the auction system with foreign-exchange, making the system unsustainable and access to foreign exchange more or less impossible, even with the fast pace of depreciation. (The latest Dicom auction, held on April 5th, set the rate at BsF49,500:US$1). In this environment, the black-market foreign-exchange rate continues to weaken; it was at around BsF300,000:US$1 in early April.
Given the existing distortions in the foreign-exchange market and growing hyperinflation, the government may, as part of a stabilisation plan, introduce a new domestic currency or attempt some kind of currency substitution in the future. Under our current political assumptions, similar measures may be undertaken after 2019. The exact nature and implementation of the plan is hard to foresee, but our baseline forecast includes the continuation of some currency controls for the duration of the forecast period.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
We expect the current-account surplus to reach US$4.8bn in 2018 (2.1% of GDP at the distorted exchange rate, which overstates the GDP in dollar terms), owing to continued import compression. However, Venezuela's lack of access to foreign finance means that the current-account surplus will not be enough to meet the country's financing needs. Indeed, excluding arrears, we calculate that principal repayments of sovereign and state-owned companies' bonded debt alone will amount to US$3.5bn in 2018. As such, we expect further arrears in 2018 and 2019. By 2020, with a new government in power, we expect that-following a debt renegotiation-external financing will be restored and imports will begin a recovery. We expect the current account to go into a deficit of 6.2% of GDP in 2020 at a less highly distorted exchange rate. Recovering oil production and the re-structured interest payment schedule facilitate a narrowing of the current-account deficit to 4.7% of GDP in 2022.
Assuming that a new administration is in power from around 2019, we expect financial and investment inflows to provide sufficient financing, stabilise balance-of-payments dynamics and help to rebuild reserves coverage. This will buttress the stability of the external accounts and facilitate the gradual removal of foreign-exchange controls, narrowing the gap between official and parallel exchange rates. However, there are considerable risks to this rosy outlook. In addition to anticipating a mixed administration capable of retaining power, it hinges on a substantial assistance package from the IMF, the quick imple-mentation of a successful macroeconomic stabilisation package, the fast resolution of a debt renegotiation process within 2019-20, substantial inflows of financial and real investment into the economy in 2020-22, and a fast recovery in oil output after years of underinvestment and mismanagement.

Abstract: First phase of third airport in Istanbul, the capital, becomes operational. A presidential system of government will come into effect by late 2019, and possibly earlier. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president and leader of the AKP, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkey's involvement in the conflict in neighbouring Syria will continue to influence the direction of Turkey's foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly regarding the conflict in Syria, where they are co-operating but have been pursuing contrasting goals. [...]the central government deficit, which captures most of the public sector, expanded from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to 1.5% in 2017.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Turkey is due to hold municipal elections in March 2019 and parliamentary and presidential elections in Novem ber of that year. However, these elections could be held earlier than scheduled, even in 2018, if the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) believe that they have sufficient support to win, or if economic headwinds start to pose a risk to their electoral dominance.
After the presidential and parliamentary elections an executive presidency will replace the current parliamentary system of government. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Mr Erdogan and the AKP to win the elections and remain in power until 2024, and probably beyond. The new system provides few checks on the president's powers, moving Turkey closer to one-man rule. Since the failed coup in 2016 there has been a deterioration in Turkey's relations with its Western allies. We expect a complete rupture to be avoided, but tensions will remain high.
The AKP has enjoyed 15 years of single-party rule, and for most of that period political and government effectiveness have improved. However, since 2013 economic policymaking institutions have become increasingly politicised. We now expect that the Turkish authorities will accept a much weaker path for the lira than we expected previously, at least during the first half of the forecast period (2018-22), with consequently higher inflation, larger fiscal deficits and smaller current-account deficits.
We expect annual budget deficits to widen moderately, to 2.9% of GDP on average in 2018-19 (from 2.4% previously), before narrowing gradually after the elections, to 1.8% of GDP in 2022 (from 1.6% previously). The risk of a larger deterioration in the public finances cannot be ruled out.
We forecast a slowdown in real GDP growth from 7.3% in 2017 to a still robust 4.4% per year on average in 2018-22 (4.1% previously), reflecting higher taxes, which will offset the impact of stimulus measures. Our growth forecast assumes that domestic political conditions will stabilise and foreign investor confidence in Turkey will hold up, maintaining foreign capital inflows.
We expect the current-account deficit to remain broadly unchanged in 2018 at 5.7% of GDP, before narrowing to a still large 4.9% per year in 2019-22 (5.2% previously). This will make it difficult for Turkey to meet its external financing needs if global liquidity is severely constrained and investor confidence deteriorates.

Turkey's score deteriorates only slightly in 2018-22, but in the global rankings the country falls by 11 places, to 60th. There is consensus among policymakers on the need to maintain macroeconomic stability. However, the failed coup and the government's response have increased the level of uncertainty about the direction of policy. Shortcomings include a politicised and inefficient judicial system, labour market rigidities and widespread tax evasion.
Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Privatisations are likely to be delayed amid the post-coup upheaval in the state institutions. Some companies, notably those with media holdings or ties with the Gulenist movement, remain subject to heavy-handed state intervention.
2020-22: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) remains a government priority, but concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2020-22: FDI inflows are boosted by further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Capital controls are not considered. There is a boost to trade and tourism following the lifting of Russian sanctions.
2020-22: Negotiations with the EU to update the customs union are likely to be protracted given poor Turkish-EU relations.
Taxes
2018-19: Efforts to improve tax collection and prevent evasion make limited progress. Some tax rate rises, including on company profits, are introduced in 2018 to curb the widening of the budget deficit.
2020-22: A broader income tax base as exemptions and exceptions are reduced.
Financing
2018-19: Political pressure on the Central Bank of Turkey not to raise interest rates continues. Risk of the US imposing fines on several Turkish banks over alleged violations of US sanctions on Iran.
2020-22: Banking system remains stable, despite weaknesses. Heavy reliance on volatile capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues.
The labour market
2018-19: Relatively high labour costs, low workforce participation and widespread informal employment.
2020-22: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure
2018-19: First phase of third airport in Istanbul, the capital, becomes operational. Slower progress made on other projects.
2020-22: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks might persist.
Technological readiness
2018-19: Spending on research and development remains moderate at about 1% of GDP, holding back efforts to move the economy up the value-added ladder.
2020-22: Turkey's young population spurs further rapid digital transformation of the banking sector.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West, becoming a member of the Council of Europe (in 1949) and NATO (in 1952), and signing an association agreement with the then European Community (in 1963). A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule, but the coup attempt in July 2016 failed. Turkey currently has a unicameral parliamentary system of government, with parliament elected for a four-year term. To win seats parties need at least 10% of the national vote, but candidates can run as independents. A presidential system of government will come into effect by late 2019, and possibly earlier. Since the failed coup power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of the president and leader of the AKP, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability is Turkey's biggest policy challenge. Fiscal policy has been prudent, but large external financing needs and changing global liquidity conditions require the Central Bank of Turkey to keep monetary policy relatively tight to attract adequate capital inflows. The Kurdish problem, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is one of Turkey's most pressing policy issues, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015, and there has been a resurgence in violence. The failed coup highlighted institutional weaknesses, which, with the AKP's consent until 2013, allowed the secretive Gulenist movement to infiltrate the state. Politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence from the government. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The basic rate of corporation tax has been raised in 2018, from 20% to 22%. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. Tax reform to reduce evasion was one of the main elements of previous IMF reform programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2017 goods exports (fob) came to US$166bn and imports (fob) to US$224bn, leaving a trade deficit of US$59bn-a sharp widening from US$41bn in 2016. The export figure includes estimates of earnings from "suitcase trade".

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
Turkey is due to hold municipal elections in March 2019 and parliamentary and presidential elections in November that year. However, the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his ruling, religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) could hold them earlier than scheduled, even in 2018, if they believe that they have sufficient support to win, or if economic headwinds start to pose a risk to their electoral dominance. After these votes an executive presidential system of government will replace the current parlia-mentary system. The Economist Intelligence Unit's baseline forecast is that the AKP and Mr Erdogan, who came close to being overthrown in an attempted coup by parts of the military in July 2016, will win the elections and remain in power until 2024, and probably beyond. The constitutional reforms to establish a presidential system, which were approved in a referendum in April 2017, provide few checks and balances on the powers of the president. This will further weaken Turkey's democratic institutions and governance structures, effectively moving the country into a system of one-man rule by Mr Erdogan. Although an unlikely prospect, failure by Mr Erdogan and the AKP to win the elections could throw the political system into chaos and open up irreparable divisions in the AKP.
We expect social and political tensions to remain high until the elections in 2019, and possibly beyond. The narrow presidential reform referendum victory, amid allegations of vote tampering, has further polarised the country. It also raised concerns among the AKP's leaders that Mr Erdogan and his party were losing support. With the president's political future dependent on clear victories in all three elections, the government will continue its campaign against political opponents, critics and perceived enemies of the state, using the state of emergency law. Emergency rule was initially introduced after the failed coup to purge the state of Mr Erdogan's former allies, the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Islamic cleric who is accused by the government of masterminding the coup attempt. We expect emergency rule to remain in place until after the elections, because it will effectively allow Mr Erdogan to govern as a president with executive powers until the new system of government is fully in place. The politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence from the government.
The operational capacity problems created by the purge of the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) and the police after the attempted coup appear to have eased to a large extent, but security risk remains high. Turkey is vulnerable to terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Islamic State (IS). Neither the government nor the PKK are interested in reviving the peace negotiations that collapsed in mid-2015, increasing the risk that violence will return to 1980s levels. Turkey's military operations in Syria are seeking to block the territorial expansion of Syrian Kurds affiliated with the PKK, but risk further fuelling the conflict with the PKK in Turkey's south-east. The defeat of IS in Syria and Iraq could result in renewed attacks in Turkey and elsewhere.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
As things stand, we expect Mr Erdogan and the AKP to win the next presidential and parliamentary elections and to remain in power until 2024, and probably beyond. The opposition is fragmented, Mr Erdogan's popularity is still unrivalled and he has the support of the right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP). Importantly, the AKP also has the ability to control the election process. However, there are concerns within the AKP that the party has lost support since the referendum, and that a victory for Mr Erdogan in the presidential election is far from assured, especially if Abdullah Gul, a former president and co-founder of the AKP, decides to run. The challenge of Mr Gul, combined with that of the charismatic Meral Aksener-who recently formed the Good Party (IP), a breakaway group from the MHP-and the leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), Kemal Kilicdaroglu, could prevent Mr Erdogan from reaching the 50% threshold for victory in the first round. This would transform the second-round run-off between Mr Erdogan and the candidate with the second-largest share of votes into a deeply polarising referendum on Mr Erdogan's leadership.
The clampdown on the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP) since mid-2015, the decision of the MHP leadership to back the presidential reform, and the hardline nationalist stance adopted by Mr Erdogan and the AKP could have a considerable effect on voting patterns at the next parliamentary election. The HDP risks falling below the high 10% national vote threshold for parliamentary representation. This would boost the AKP's seat share. Support for the MHP has also fallen, but in exchange for the MHP's backing of Mr Erdogan in the presidential election, the two parties have agreed an electoral alliance to ensure that the MHP retains its representation in parliament. Under the constitutional changes approved in the referendum there will be 600 seats in a much weakened parliament from the next election, up from 550 currently.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Domestic political and security issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign policy sphere. There is a considerable risk of a rupture in Turkey's ties with its traditional Western allies, compounding these allies' concerns that under Mr Erdogan the country is pivoting eastwards. Many factors have contrib-uted to the deterioration, including political upheaval in Europe and the US; a perceived lack of Western solidarity with Turkey after the failed coup; the US's military backing of PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurdish groups; the Turkish govern-ment's authoritarian tendencies and its strident anti-Western rhetoric; tensions over gas exploration in the Eastern Mediterranean; and Turkey's forging of closer relations with Russia, China and Iran. Turkey's confrontational approach to its traditional Western allies should also be viewed in the context of Mr Erdogan's need to maintain the support of the country's nationalists to achieve his domestic political goals, notably to become president with executive powers after the next elections, due in 2019.
Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and increasingly transactional rather than strategic, but we expect Turkey and its Western allies to avoid a complete breakdown in relations. However, this might become unavoidable if the EU suspends the country's moribund accession negotiations, the migrant deal with the EU collapses, the US imposes sanctions on Turkey over alleged violations by Turkish banks of US sanctions against Iran, Turkey closes the Incirlik air base to US forces, or it withdraws from NATO, none of which can be ruled out completely. Operation Olive Branch, Turkey's cross-border military operation in Afrin in north-western Syria that was launched in January 2018, has accentuated tensions with the US. The operation cleared the area of US-backed, PKK-affiliated Kurdish groups that are intent on establishing a continuous autonomous region along Syria's northern border with Turkey.
Turkey's involvement in the conflict in neighbouring Syria will continue to influence the direction of Turkey's foreign policy. Since mid-2016 relations between Turkey and Russia have improved, but the level of trust between the two countries is still low, particularly regarding the conflict in Syria, where they are co-operating but have been pursuing contrasting goals. We expect relations to continue to be largely transactional. The risk of new tensions emerging will remain high.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
Turkey's economy has shown resilience during past bouts of political instability and global financial market volatility, owing largely to the country's solid public finances, its well-capitalised, well-regulated banking sector and its dynamic, diversified private business sector. However, the risk of an intensification of political instability and fluctuations in global liquidity could disrupt foreign capital inflows during the forecast period (2018-22). These inflows are needed to meet the country's large external financing requirements, but tend to be short-term and highly volatile. Shifts in capital flows triggered by expectations of tighter US monetary policy and geopolitical tensions in the neighbouring region have already put the lira under severe pressure on several occasions since late 2016, fuelling an acceleration in inflation and increasing the cost to firms of servicing their foreign debt. Under political pressure not to raise interest rates further, especially ahead of the 2019 elections, the Central Bank of Turkey is constrained in its ability to tighten monetary policy. We now expect that the Turkish authorities will accept a much weaker path for the lira than we expected previously, at least during the first half of the forecast period, with consequently higher inflation, larger fiscal deficits and smaller current-account deficits.
Uncertainty about the direction of Turkey's economic policy continues to cloud the country's medium-term economic outlook. The government's focus on domestic power struggles and foreign policy challenges has blocked the economic reforms needed to improve the business and investment climate. The current direction of policy appears to be towards fiscal loosening and relatively tight monetary policy, although these are unconventional measures, at the same time as encouraging banks to lend to households and businesses.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Low budget deficit/GDP and public debt/GDP ratios-reflecting the impact of cautious fiscal policy in the past and major upward revisions to Turkey's national accounts-have given the government some leeway to loosen fiscal policy to support the economy in the aftermath of the attempted coup in July 2016. As a result, the central government deficit, which captures most of the public sector, expanded from 1.1% of GDP in 2016 to 1.5% in 2017. Despite a series of tax increases this year, we expect increased government spending on defence, security, infrastructure projects and public employment ahead of the elections next year to cause the deficit to widen further, to an average of 2.9% of GDP in 2018-19 (2.4% of GDP previously), before narrowing to 1.8% in 2022 (1.6% previously). We expect the central government debt/GDP ratio to remain broadly stable at 28-29% in 2018-20, before declining gradually to about 27% in 2022. Our baseline forecast is predicated on the assumption that fiscal policy will be kept relatively tight to support investor confidence and to prevent a surge in domestic demand from causing an unsustainable widening of the current-account deficit. However, the risk of a larger deterioration in the public finances has increased, reflecting the impact of political instability ahead of the next elections.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The central bank will have to keep its monetary policy tight in 2018 in order to dampen inflationary pressures and prevent further depreciation of the lira amid political volatility, higher US interest rates and balance sheet tapering by the Federal Reserve (the US central bank). However, because of political pressure not to raise interest rates further, we expect the Central Bank of Turkey to have to resort to unorthodox and less effective tools to respond to the challenge, which will periodically test investor confidence in the bank's policy stance. The bank raised most of its main policy rates between November 2016 and April 2017, but since November 2017 it has focused on using its previously little used "late liquidity window" overnight lending rate to fund the banking system. This rate was gradually raised by a total of 275 basis points in 2017, to 12.75% in mid-December, pushing the weighted average cost of the central bank's funds to the banking system to 12.75% since January 2018, compared with 7.8% in November 2016.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Real GDP growth accelerated sharply, from an annual average of 3.3% in 2016 to 7.3% in 2017, supported by government stimulus measures, government credit guarantees, political pressure on banks to extend credit, improved export competitiveness and a pick-up in global demand. We expect growth to slow to an annual average of 4.4% in 2018-19 (revised up from 4.3% previously), reflecting the impact of tax increases, higher interest rates and a gradual tightening of global liquidity, which will offset planned stimulus measures to boost employment and investment. The main downside risk is that further political instability stemming from the transition to a presidential system of government will deter foreign capital inflows. Upside risk stems from further government stimulus measures, but this could also result in larger than expected fiscal deficits.
We are forecasting that household consumption growth will moderate from 6% of GDP in 2017 to a still solid 3.9% per year in 2018-22 as a result of higher interest rates and slower employment growth. We expect government consumption growth to accelerate from 5% in 2017 to an annual average rate of 5.8% in 2018-19, easing after the elections to a more moderate, but still robust, 4.8% in 2020-22.
The deterioration in the business environment since the attempted coup and an increase in the corporation tax rate to 22% from 2018 will continue to hold down private-sector fixed investment growth. However, we expect this to be offset by government investment, especially in infrastructure, generating real growth of 5.5% per year in 2018-19. In 2020-22 we forecast a deceleration to annual growth of 4.8% per year, reflecting public-sector retrenchment and firms' response to a more moderate expansion of domestic and external demand.
The lifting of Russian sanctions on Turkey (especially in the tourism sector), the positive effect of a weaker lira on export competitiveness and strong external demand have contributed to a rebound in exports of goods and services. However, we expect growth to slow from 11.9% in 2017 to an annual average rate of 4.7% in 2018-22, reflecting base effects and our view that 2017 probably represented the recent peak in the global trade cycle. Our expectations of a steady weakening of the lira during the forecast period will dampen import growth.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Consumer price inflation has remained stubbornly high-well above the official 5% medium-term target. Reflecting the political constraints on the ability of the central bank to tighten monetary policy further, continued weakness of the Turkish lira and recovering global commodity prices, we have raised the path of our consumer price inflation forecast to remain above the official medium-term target of 5% throughout the forecast period. Assuming that the central bank does not loosen monetary policy too soon, we expect inflation to ease gradually, to 6.5% by end-2022. There are significant upside risks to our revised forecast if the lira depreciates much more rapidly than we are now forecasting.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
We have revised our exchange-rate forecast for 2018-22. We now expect the lira to average TL4.79:US$1 in 2022 (TL4.26:US1 previously), compared with TL3.65:US$1 in 2017. Nevertheless, after a fall in the nominal value of the lira of about 17% against the US dollar in 2017, we expect the pace of depreciation to slow, keeping the currency broadly stable in real terms during the forecast period. There are substantial risks to this forecast in both directions, arising from uncertainty about the outlook for global financial flows as well as the impact on investor confidence of domestic political tensions and geopolitical turmoil in the region.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
The moderately higher cost of imported energy and inputs for manufactured import-intensive exports has offset the boost to Turkey's main exports from a weaker lira and the lifting of Russian sanctions. Owing to particularly large trade deficits at the end of 2017 and in early 2018, we expect the current-account deficit to widen slightly from 5.6% of GDP last year to 5.7% of GDP this year. However, moderating capital inflows will keep the lira weak and interest rates relatively high, contributing to a slowdown in import demand and a consequent narrowing of the current-account deficit during the forecast period. Turkey's substantial external financing needs will be difficult to meet if global liquidity is constrained and investor confidence deteriorates further. We expect the rebound in tourist arrivals in 2017 to continue, but it will remain vulnerable to a possible resurgence of terrorist attacks in the country.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
Following a snap general election in June 2017, in which the Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority, the prime minister, Theresa May, formed a minority government based on a "confidence and supply" agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect it to last a full five-year term; its working majority of 13 (down from 17 before the election) will be eroded by by-elections, and it will face domestic and external challenges during the Brexit process.
Mrs May will continue to face difficulties in reconciling opposing factions in her cabinet, who have very different views about negotiating the UK's future relationship with the EU. An important milestone in the Brexit negotiations came in March 2018 when EU leaders approved the terms of the transition period, which will last for 21 months from when the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. However, divisions in the cabinet and on the Conservative backbenches over Brexit are likely to persist in 2018-19.
Completing the agreement on the terms of the UK's withdrawal will take priority in 2018, but talks on the future trading relationship will begin this year. The government intends to leave the single market and the customs union, and will aim to reach a comprehensive free-trade agreement with the EU. We expect a trade deal to be in place by 2021.
The economy has been resilient in the wake of the Brexit vote, growing by 1.9% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017, but is likely to lose momentum in 2018-19 as rising inflation and uncertainty about the Brexit negotiations dampen domestic demand. We forecast average annual real GDP growth of 1.5% in 2018-19, picking up to an average of 1.8% per year in 2020-22.
The government's budget deficit has narrowed from 4.3% of GDP in 2015, to an estimated 2.9% of GDP in 2017. We expect a further gradual decline in 2018-22, with the deficit contracting to 1.5% of GDP in 2022. The Bank of England (BoE, the central bank) has signalled a readiness to raise interest rates again after doing so in November 2017 for the first time in a decade, and we expect the next increase to happen by August 2018.

The UK's business environment score improves in 2018-22 compared with 2013-17, lifting the country by five places in the global ranking and by four places in the regional ranking. Brexit introduces policy uncertainty, but the UK's strengths-a pro-business policy orientation, a welcoming attitude to foreign investment, and flexible labour and product markets-will endure.
Country forecast overview: United Kingdom's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Lloyds, one of two banks rescued post-crisis by the state, returns to private ownership; government retains big stake in struggling Royal Bank of Scotland. Brexit focus constrains reforms to improve weak trends in investment and productivity.
2020-22: Shake-up of regulatory and competition frameworks post-Brexit. Continued state support underpins house prices.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Government pursues policies to encourage foreign direct investment inflows.
2020-22: Infrastructure plans offer investment opportunities. Likely changes in tax policies to bolster inward investment.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: Talks begin on post-Brexit UK-EU free-trade agreement. UK leaves EU single market (and probably customs union). Possible disruption to crossborder trade. Risk of no deal, with UK subject to World Trade Organisation (WTO) trade rules.
2020-22: Terms of new UK-EU trading arrangement phased in.
Taxes
2018-19: Gradual rise in total tax burden, further reduction in corporate tax rate. Changes to system of business rates.
2020-22: Ongoing efforts to reduce revenue lost to tax evasion. Possible tax increases to support the public finances.
Financing
2018-19: Modest tightening in financial conditions likely in run-up to Brexit. Loose monetary policy persists. "Ring-fencing" bank reforms and ongoing capital strengthening (ahead of 2019 deadlines). Demand for alternative forms of debt financing.
2020-22: Availability of finance unchanged. Possible loss of "passporting" rights and restrictions on EU services trade.
The labour market
2018-19: Firms defer some hiring decisions amid Brexit uncertainty. Possible modest decline in inflows of EU workers. New apprenticeship levy and phased increase in compulsory "national living wage". Wage growth remains subdued.
2020-22: Some form of restrictions on free movement of labour from EU, but likely to be flexible in response to business concerns. Policymakers struggle to respond to weak productivity and deficit in intermediate skills.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Modest rise in spending on housing, roads and digital infrastructure. Crossrail service in London begins operating.
2020-22: Construction of high-speed rail link between London and the north of England. EU-funded investment falls.
Technological readiness
2018-19: UK performs well in research, innovation, new technology adoption, lags somewhat in cyber-security preparation.
2020-22: The research and development (R&D)/GDP ratio remains the same; innovation performance good, full commercial potential unrealised.

Background: The end of the second world war coincided with the decline of the UK as an imperial power. Residual links with former colonial territories, close relations with the US and a separate sense of identity delayed UK membership of the European Community (now the EU) until 1973. Successive governments have resisted closer EU integration. In a referendum in June 2016 the UK electorate voted to leave the EU. The future contours of the UK's relationship with the EU are uncertain, but a diminution of UK influence in the region looks inevitable.
Political structure: The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II. Parliament has an elected House of Commons (the lower house, 650 seats) and a non-elected House of Lords (the upper house, non-fixed membership of about 800). The general election in June 2017 produced a minority centre-right Conservative Party government, dependent on the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) for a working majority. The main opposition Labour Party increased its parliamentary seats by 30 in the June 2017 snap general election, but its ability to compete with the Conservatives will be undermined when the government redraws parliamentary constituency boundaries, which are currently favourable to Labour.
Policy issues: UK economic policy has yet to return to normal after the financial crisis, with an exceptionally loose monetary stance. Real GDP growth slowed in 2015-16. The fallout from the Brexit vote will dominate the policy agenda; The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to focus efforts on negotiating the terms of its departure from the EU and on reducing the damaging effect on the economy of the uncertainty created by the vote. This has led to a shift in the UK's monetary and fiscal policy mix, with fiscal policies becoming more significant. Managing Brexit could force policymakers to address structural deficiencies in the UK, such as weak productivity.
Taxation: The headline rate of corporation tax has been steadily reduced, from 28% in 2010 to 20% since April 2015. There are three bands of personal income tax, set at 20%, 40% and 45% (the 45% rate came into effect in April 2013, replacing the 50% rate that was introduced in 2010). The standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 20% (raised from 17.5% in 2011). Excise duties on tobacco and alcohol are among the highest in Europe.
Foreign trade: In 2016 exports of goods totalled US$408.1bn and imports amounted to US$591bn, resulting in a trade deficit of US$182.9bn. The traditional services surplus fell to US$127.8bn. The overall current-account deficit widened in absolute terms, to US$154.9bn, from US$149.8bn in 2015, and expanded as a share of GDP, to 5.8%, from 5.2%.

Outlook for 2018-22: Political stability
The decision of the prime minister, Theresa May, to call an early general election in June 2017 backfired disastrously for the Conservative Party, which lost its majority. Mrs May has recently recouped some authority through her handling of the nerve agent attack on a former Russian military intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter Yulia on March 4th 2018. The prime minister blamed Russia, rallied the UK's international allies and expelled 23 Russian diplomats from the embassy in London. However, the positive political boost for the prime minister may prove to be short-lived.
Mrs May will continue to face difficulties in reconciling opposing factions in the cabinet, who have very different views about negotiating the UK's future relationship with the EU. An important milestone in the negotiations came on March 22nd when EU leaders approved the terms of the transition period, which will last for 21 months from when the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. However, divisions in the cabinet and on the Conservative backbenches over Brexit are likely to persist in 2018-19.
Brexiteers in the cabinet have been supportive of Mrs May since the election because they want her to hold fast to her pledges to leave the single market, the customs union and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). This faction includes the Brexit secretary, David Davis; the international trade secretary, Liam Fox; the environment minister, Michael Gove; and the foreign affairs minister, Boris Johnson. They will support the prime minister as long as she pursues their vision of Brexit. However, Mrs May is also under pressure from those advocating a "softer" Brexit, who favour an extended post-2019 transition period, during which the UK would retain single market and/or customs union access. This group includes the chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, and the home secretary, Amber Rudd, as well as Mrs May's adviser on Europe, Oliver Robbins. These divisions could sharpen, presenting a threat to government stability in 2018.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
A snap general election was held on June 8th 2017, three years ahead of schedule. Mrs May's decision to call the election was a political miscalculation, resulting in the Conservatives losing 13 seats, leaving them with 318 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons (the lower house of parliament). The Labour Party won 30 seats in a swing of almost 10 percentage points from the 2015 election, giving it 262 parliamentary seats. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which increased its share of parliamentary seats from eight to ten, became kingmaker.
The Conservatives formed a working government, based on a "confidence and supply" arrangement with Northern Ireland's DUP. This arrangement is likely to work in the short term, because neither party wants another election-they are natural allies on questions of sovereignty and the EU, and the DUP is committed to preventing the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, from coming to power given his past association with Northern Ireland's main nationalist party, Sinn Fein. However, the arrangement is politically fragile, and the government's 13-seat working majority (down from 17 seats before the election) will dwindle with each by-election.
The Conservatives and Labour remain more or less neck and neck in recent opinion polls, on about 40-41%. Labour has lost some of the momentum from the 2017 general election, and has been damaged by persistent evidence of anti-Semitism in the party. The next general election is scheduled for May 2022. Lacking a parliamentary majority and divided over Brexit, the government will do well to last until then, and there is a risk of another pre-term election. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the Conservative Party to see through the Brexit negotiations in 2018-21 before contemplating changing the party leadership and risking precipitating another early general election, for which there is no appetite at present.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
In line with the government's intention to honour the Brexit vote by taking control of laws, borders and the budget, the UK will formally leave the single market at the end of the Article 50 process in March 2019. In February 2018 UK and EU negotiators reached agreement on large parts of the draft withdrawal agreement that must be finalised by the autumn. This included agreement on the terms of the transition period, which will last for 21 months after the UK's formal withdrawal from the EU at end-March 2019. EU leaders approved the terms of the transition period at a summit on March 22nd-23rd. There is a risk that a clash between the EU and the UK on the Irish border issue could scupper the withdrawal agreement, but this is not our forecast.
Agreement was reached in many areas, including on citizens' rights, the financial settlement, Euratom and on most areas relating to separation provisions (the continued circulation of goods placed on the market and customs procedures). There is also full agreement on the terms of the transition period-the UK will maintain access to the single market, but will be bound by the obligations of membership. The UK made several concessions that are unpalatable to Brexiteers: EU law will still be applicable; EU budget contributions will continue; the UK will have no say over fishing quotas; and there will be reciprocal free movement and subsequent entitlement to settled status until the end of the transition period. A win for the UK is that it will not be bound by the EU's trade policy, allowing it to agree new trade deals during the transition.
Despite political pressure to stay in the EU customs union, the UK government's official line is that it will leave to pursue an independent trade policy. However, we expect some degree of regulatory alignment that will mean less new physical and technological infrastructure at border areas that might otherwise have been required outside the customs union. The government is likely to seek a complete alignment of regulations in some areas; "mutual recognition" sufficient to sustain trade flows in others; and divergence in other areas where the country would like to set its own regulations.
Negotiations on trade will come with their own set of challenges, as competing interests among the member states will complicate the process. During trade talks the EU will resist attempts by the UK to cherry-pick from the benefits of membership, but the end result is likely to be a more comprehensive trade deal than that negotiated by the EU and Canada in 2016.
There are numerous obstacles to the successful conclusion of the negotiations, but we believe that compromises will make a deal possible, particularly given the economic incentive to maintain existing trade ties. Realistically, only the framework of a trade deal will be agreed by the time the UK withdraws in 2019, as completing the withdrawal agreement will take priority in 2018. However, transition arrangements will allow negotiations to continue, and we expect a deal to be in place by 2021.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
The UK's departure from the EU will encourage policymakers to address some of the structural deficiencies that have held back the economy in recent years, including lacklustre productivity growth, insufficient innovation and poor infra-structure. Mr Hammond announced a National Productivity Investment Fund to boost the UK's digital infrastructure and spending on research and develop-ment over the next five years. Proposals to reform the UK's housing market have focused on introducing greater speed and flexibility into the planning process. There will also be a new effort to improve vocational skills. We expect these measures to support the recovery in productivity, but they are still too modest in size and scope to close the UK's productivity gap with its G7 peers.
The Queen's Speech in June 2017 set out the government's legislative agenda, which was dominated by Brexit. Eight of the 27 bills relate to the transfer of EU law into British law, a UK customs regime, independent trade policy, controls on immigration, fisheries policy, agricultural policy, nuclear safeguards and the UK's ability to impose international sanctions. In a further sign that Brexit is the government's priority, the parliamentary session will last for two years rather than one, ending two months after the UK's withdrawal at end-March 2019.
The centrepiece of the autumn budget in November 2017 was a sizeable increase in spending on the National Health Service (NHS). In March 2018 Mrs May said that the government would this year draw up a "long-term funding plan" to secure the future of the NHS.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
In the spring statement, delivered on March 13th, Mr Hammond presented slightly upgraded forecasts for GDP growth and the public finances compared with the autumn budget in November 2017. The government is on track to meet its "fiscal mandate" of a deficit smaller than 2% of GDP by 2020/21, implying some scope for higher public spending in the autumn budget statement.
We estimate that the budget deficit stabilised at 2.9% of GDP in 2017, and we expect it to narrow to 2.7% in 2018. In the remainder of our forecast period the government will aim to nudge down discretionary spending as a proportion of GDP. We expect the deficit to contract to 1.9% of GDP by 2020 and 1.5% by 2022. We forecast that public debt will peak at 88.1% of GDP in 2018, before falling to 81% by the end of 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
At its meeting in March 2018 the monetary policy committee (MPC) of the Bank of England (BoE, the central bank) voted to keep the main policy interest rate unchanged at 0.5%, five months after raising it by 25 basis points for the first time in a decade. Seven members of the nine-strong committee supported this position, with two members voting to increase the policy rate by 25 basis points to 0.75%. The MPC is keen to begin normalising its policy rate and we now expect the timing for the next BoE rate rise to occur in May or August, rather than in the fourth quarter of 2018. We expect a gradual tightening cycle to follow, with a series of 25-basis-point increases in the policy rate over the next five years, taking it to 2.25% by end-2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
The economy has been resilient in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Average annual real GDP growth was firm in 2016 and 2017, at 1.9% and 1.8% respectively. However, the annual pace of growth slowed throughout 2017, from 2.1% in January-March to 1.4% in October-December. We forecast a further modest growth slowdown in the next two years, to 1.5% on average in 2018-19, led by a deceleration in domestic demand.
A looser fiscal stance will provide some positive support to real GDP growth throughout the forecast period, but consumer spending will weaken in response to the continued squeeze on household disposable incomes from falling real wages. Consumer spending was fairly resilient to this pressure in 2017, reflecting employment gains, high levels of household borrowing and a sharp drawdown of savings. In 2018 we expect employment growth to slow and greater uncertainty about the economic outlook to push up precautionary savings. Consumer spending will recover in 2019-22 as inflation eases, uncertainty recedes and unemployment edges lower. However, increased borrowing costs arising from tighter monetary policy will hold back the pace of the recovery in these years. We forecast that investment spending will decelerate in 2018-19 as a result of heightened uncertainty during difficult Brexit trade negotiations and higher cost pressures as a result of sterling's depreciation, before recovering in 2020-22 as these effects fade.
Survey-based indicators suggest that preliminary GDP data for the first quarter of 2018 will confirm a picture of relatively firm activity when it is released on April 27th. Also mitigating the extent of the domestically driven slowdown in 2018 will be a positive contribution to GDP growth from the external balance as export volumes benefit from a competitiveness boost as a result of sterling's depreciation, while the weaker domestic demand environment reduces import growth. The export boost will ease in 2019, after which we expect the trade balance to exert a drag on GDP growth owing to our forecast for a recovery in domestic demand, which will push up import growth again. Our expectation of a business cycle downturn in the US in 2020 and a deal on the UK's new trading relationship with the EU, which should take effect in 2021 and result in looser trade ties than before, will also constrain exports in 2020-22. We expect real GDP growth to pick up to 1.8% on average in those years.
Trade policy is the biggest risk to our forecast for economic growth globally. In March the US announced new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports; a number of countries, including the EU, received an exemption. This expires on May 1st and there is a risk that if the US lets it expire and applies tariffs to EU exports, the bloc could retaliate with tariffs of its own, leading to a broader trade conflict.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
The headline rate of annual inflation-as measured by the consumer price index including owner occupiers' housing costs (CPIH)-accelerated to 2.6% on average in 2017, up from 1% in 2016. The increase partially reflected a rebound in oil prices, but has been amplified by the sharp depreciation of sterling since the Brexit vote. The pound has since reversed much of this appreciation, but we expect it to weaken again in 2018-20, and oil prices are likely to rise further this year. As retailers continue to pass on high input costs to customers, we expect inflation to remain above the BoE's official 2% target for much of 2018, averaging 2.4%, even as domestic price pressure weakens. Tighter monetary policy from 2019 will bring inflation back towards the bank's target; we forecast that inflation will ease to 1.9% next year and 2.1% on average in 2020-22.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
There was a sharp drop in the external value of sterling after the Brexit vote. Sensitivity in the foreign-exchange markets to the Brexit news flow led to significant volatility in the value of the pound in 2017, although it appreciated in the second half of the year. An increase in political risk in the US in January 2018 triggered a surge in the US dollar:pound exchange rate to a post-referendum high of US$1.43:£1. The exchange rate has since receded a little from this level, but we forecast that it will average US$1.40:£1 this year, after averaging US$1.29:£1 in 2017. This forecast reflects the recent resilience in the pound (partly because of the performance of the economy), but also assumes that it will weaken as Brexit negotiations enter their most challenging phase and as the economy slows. We expect sterling to depreciate slightly against the US dollar and the euro in 2018-20, before recovering in 2021-22.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
The merchandise trade balance will keep the current account in deficit through-out 2018-22, offsetting surpluses on the services account. We expect a narrowing of the current-account deficit, from an estimated 4.6% of GDP in 2017 to 4.3% in 2022 (following a current-account deficit of 5.8% of GDP in 2016), reflecting a shift in the primary income balance as the under-performance of the UK economy reduces income debits (the return that foreign residents receive on their investments in the UK) relative to credits (the return that UK residents receive from their foreign direct investment), and a reduction in secondary transfers from 2021 as the UK reduces its contribution to the EU budget.

Abstract: [...]he led the ÖVP to a plurality of the vote in the early election on October 15th, winning a 31.5% share-up by 7.5 percentage points on its result in 2013. In order to assuage concerns from Mr Kurz and the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, about the FPÖ's previous Euroscepticism, the party has agreed not to push for a referendum on EU membership. [...]EU policy will be handled by the chancellery instead of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is headed by an FPÖ appointee. [...]we expect limited progress on significant structural reforms. [...]real GDP growth was 3.1% in 2017-above growth in Germany for the first time since 2005 and Austria's fastest growth rate since 2007.

Full text: Country forecast overview: Highlights
An early election in October 2017 was won by the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), led by the young minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, who has since become chancellor at the head of a coalition government of the ÖVP and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ).
The inclusion of the FPÖ in the government will not lead to significant tensions with other EU member states, as it did in 2000, when the party was last part of a coalition. This is largely because of the normalisation of the far right in Europe since then.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the new government to focus on integration and immigration policy, and to attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and introduce some additional flexibility in labour and product markets. However, low government cohesion is likely to lead to limited progress.
We forecast that the government budget will remain in deficit, albeit well within the EU-mandated limit of 3% of GDP, throughout the forecast period (2018-22), as the fiscal consolidation process is likely to be restrained by limited government cohesion and effectiveness. The public debt/GDP ratio will fall gradually, to just below 70% by 2022, from an estimated 79.5% in 2017.
After several years of underperformance compared with its regional peers, the economy has performed relatively strongly since the start of 2016, growing by 3.1% in 2017. We forecast a continuation of strong growth this year, at 2.5%, and for growth to moderate to 1.7% on average in 2019-22.
Consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) will continue to exceed the euro zone average in 2018-22, driven by structural domestic factors including higher unit wage costs and more regulated markets. Annual inflation averaged 0.9% in 2015-16 and 2.2% in 2017. We expect annual average EU harmonised inflation of 2% in 2018-22.
The current-account surplus has been relatively stable in recent years, at about 2%. Although we expect small changes in the composition of the surplus, we expect it to remain stable overall, at 2% of GDP on average in 2018-22, driven mainly by a strong surplus on the services balance, supported by tourism inflows

Austria's business environment score rises between the historical period (2013-17) and the forecast period (2018-22), mainly owing to the improving economy. Austria's strengths as a business location include good infrastructure, stable institutions and co-operative labour relations, but high taxes, limited market opportunities and restrictive regulations will persist.
Country forecast overview: Austria's business environment at a glance
Policy towards private enterprise and competition
2018-19: Government works on reducing red tape, but progress is likely to be limited.
2020-22: Modest strengthening of competition authority's powers. Administrative reform reduces red tape. More transparency in antitrust proceedings. Risk of political interference in private firms in which state owns substantial stakes.
Policy towards foreign investment
2018-19: Foreign investment is generally welcome, but underlying opposition to takeovers of "national champions" persists.
2020-22: Possible erosion of barriers against foreign takeovers as a result of commercial pressure and EU legislation.
Foreign trade and exchange controls
2018-19: No exchange controls. Foreign trade, governed by EU rules, should remain liberal.
2020-22: EU maintains focus on bilateral free-trade agreements as multilateral trade negotiations stagnate.
Taxes
2018-19: Limited changes to the tax system aimed at reducing the sizeable income tax wedge.
2020-22: Vested interests will continue to hamper large-scale reform, and the high tax burden will remain.
Financing
2018-19: Financial stability to improve amid tighter regulatory requirements and a reduction in risk from exposure to central and eastern Europe.
2020-22: Further uptake in corporate bond issuance. Credit conditions continue to ease as banks' profitability recovers, in part supported by a gradual uptick in interest rates.
The labour market
2018-19: Economy-wide minimum wage introduced. More stringent requirements for early retirement and invalidity pensions. Labour market slowly improves as increase in labour supply moderates and unemployment continues to fall.
2020-22: Continued modest expansion of labour supply, primarily via net immigration, but concerns about shortage of skilled employees in certain sectors are likely to persist. Early retirement phased out.
Infrastructure
2018-19: Further take-up of broadband services. Gradual improvement of transport links with eastern Europe.
2020-22: Improved transport network connecting main urban centres and providing better access to the country's interior. Gradual transition to low-carbon economy entails significant changes to electricity transmission infrastructure
Technological readiness
2018-19: Internet use remains slightly below regional peers, but research and development remains relatively high.
2020-22: Further progress is made on upgrading the large manufacturing sector to take advantage of new technologies.

Background: Austria became an important force in central Europe with the formation of the Habsburg empire in the 15th century and remained so until the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of the first world war. The Republic of Austria emerged in 1918. In 1938 Austria was incorporated into the German Third Reich. With the departure of the victorious Allied forces in 1955, it regained independence as a neutral country. In the post-war period Austria took great strides to catch up economically with the rest of the developed world and is now one of the most advanced nations. It is a member of the EU and a participant in the economic and monetary union (EMU).
Political structure: Austria is a federal republic and the head of state is the federal president. The government is led by the federal chancellor. The national parliament has two houses: the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house), of 62 members appointed by state parliaments, and the National Council (Nationalrat, the lower house), which has 183 members elected by proportional representation. An early general election was held on October 15th 2017.
Policy issues: The government will focus on migration and integration issues, including in the EU context. It will also attempt to reduce the large tax wedge and implement other measures to improve the business environment, including through enabling more flexibility in the labour market.
Taxation: Austrian labour tax as a percentage of GDP is among the highest in the EU. A 2016 tax reform lowered the tax burden for low- and middle-income earners, but raised the top personal income tax rate from 50% to 55%. Social security contributions, shared between employers and employees, are high. Corporation tax is levied at a rate of 25%. Dividend and investment income is subject to a withholding tax of 27.5%. Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a standard rate of 20%, and a reduced rate of 13% (raised from 10% in 2016) applies for certain goods and services.
Foreign trade: In 2016 the value of exported goods was US$142.7bn and the goods import bill was US$142.3bn. The services surplus, traditionally boosted by tourism receipts, was US$12.2bn. Along with a modest primary income deficit and significant secondary income deficit, this yielded a current-account surplus equivalent to 2.1% of GDP.

In May 2017, after several years of little progress on reforms, and coalition-as well as party-in-fighting, the grand coalition of the centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) fell apart following the resignation of Reinhold Mitterlehner from the positions of vice-chancellor, economy minister and leader of the ÖVP. The popular 31-year-old minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, took over the leadership of the ÖVP and reformed the party around himself. As a result, he led the ÖVP to a plurality of the vote in the early election on October 15th, winning a 31.5% share-up by 7.5 percentage points on its result in 2013. The SPÖ's vote share was unchanged, at 26.9%. The far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) increased its share of the vote by 5.5 percentage points, to 26%. The liberal NEOS returned to parliament with just over 5% of the vote, and the Greens failed to cross the 4% electoral threshold for the first time in 31 years, in part because List Pilz, led by a former leader of the Greens, narrowly managed to cross it.
In mid-December, after just over a month and a half of negotiations, the ÖVP and the FPÖ formed a coalition. Under Mr Kurz the ÖVP has moved close to the FPÖ in many policy areas (during the campaign the leader of the FPÖ, Heinz-Christian Strache, regularly accused Mr Kurz of copying the FPÖ's programme), and the negotiations thus went relatively smoothly. In order to assuage concerns from Mr Kurz and the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, about the FPÖ's previous Euroscepticism, the party has agreed not to push for a referendum on EU membership. Moreover, EU policy will be handled by the chancellery instead of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is headed by an FPÖ appointee.
Although the chancellor is from the ÖVP, the election should still be seen as a further step in the fraying of the decades-long dominance of the political scene by the SPÖ and the ÖVP, as the ÖVP has, to a large extent, been replaced by Mr Kurz's new movement. The two parties had together ruled the country almost continuously since 1945, but a renewed grand coalition had become almost impossible following the breakdown of relations between them and the gridlock in recent years. The FPÖ has profited both from this and from concerns about immigration, although Mr Kurz also owes much of his popularity to his strong stance on this issue and his plans to curtail migration into Europe and Austria.
Despite the overlap between the ÖVP's and the FPÖ's programmes, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to struggle to implement its policies, as the coalition partners are likely to disagree on economic matters, on which they are significantly less well aligned than they are on social and cultural matters. In addition, the FPÖ could struggle to translate its opposition stance on topics such as immigration and integration into concrete policy proposals, owing in part to internal party upheaval. As a result, we expect limited progress on significant structural reforms. The initial phase of the government's term is likely to be relatively smooth, owing in part to the country's role as president of the Council of the European Union in the second half of 2018. Later in the term the FPÖ might struggle to distinguish itself from the ÖVP, which could lead to tensions between the parties, creating a moderate risk of an early election.
Outlook for 2018-22: Election watch
The last general election was held on October 15th 2017. Unless the government falls before then, it will sit in the Nationalrat (the lower house of parliament) until the end of its term in late 2022. The next election for the primarily ceremonial post of federal president will be in 2022.
Three elections for state parliaments have already been held so far in 2018, with one more planned, in Salzburg. These tend to be fought on local issues and give only a limited view of national political developments. Nevertheless, the FPÖ's recent underperformance in Carinthia could push it to take stronger stances at the national level.
Outlook for 2018-22: International relations
Austria was severely affected by the European migrant crisis, and this has been the dominant issue in its domestic politics and international relations since 2015. The country has been at the centre of many of the intra-EU spats regarding the bloc's response to the large influx of migrants, owing in part to its unilateral actions, including the leading role that it played in closing the migration route through the Balkans. Domestic pressure on the government to be seen as acting against this inflow, and thus often against other EU member states, will remain high. The new government plans to cut child benefit payments flowing abroad, potentially leading to tensions with eastern member states in particular.
Nevertheless, Mr Kurz has been at pains to point out that his government will be pro-EU, and that Austria's EU membership will not be questioned in the coming years. The new government plans for Austria to be a leading voice in the bloc in the coming years, especially on reform of migration, and this should be facilitated by the country's role as president of the Council of the European Union. We expect the government to find broad support for proposals such as tighter controls of the EU's outer borders and processing asylum applications outside the EU.
Although the previous inclusion of the FPÖ in government following the 1999 election led to sanctions being imposed by other EU nations in 2000, the reception has been more muted this time. At that time a far-right nationalist party entering government was an unusual development, but since then sister parties to the FPÖ have either entered government or supported minority governments in several EU countries, including some Nordic countries and the Netherlands.
Outlook for 2018-22: Policy trends
The new govern-ment plans to move integration and immigration policy further to the right, including through curtailing benefits for asylum-seekers and cutting child benefits sent abroad. It has also presented plans that focus on improving the business environment, including by reducing corporate tax rates and introducing more flexibility for working hours. Furthermore, it plans to cut a number of labour market programmes aimed at the long-term unemployed and integrating migrants into the labour market. However, it does not plan to reform the country's so-called Proporz system, under which the ÖVP and the SPÖ had apportioned public life-state companies, public services, subsidies, regulatory responsibilities-despite suggestions from both coalition parties in the past, especially from the FPÖ, that they would want to do this. We therefore expect reform momentum to be limited and for the government to struggle to implement significant structural reforms rapidly.
Outlook for 2018-22: Fiscal policy
Driven by both a lacklustre recovery in the wake of the financial and euro zone crises, and by a lack of fiscal consolidation, the fiscal accounts remained in modest deficit in recent years and within the 3% of GDP limit set by the EU. However, strong growth contributed to a narrowing of the deficit to an estimated 1.1% of GDP in 2017.
The government plans to reach a small budget surplus in 2019 by cutting spending and at the same time reducing income taxes and the country's sizeable tax wedge. However, it has not yet clearly outlined the spending cuts that it intends to make, barring a number of smaller measures including cutting spending on asylum-seekers, and we therefore do not share the government's optimism that a surplus can be reached in 2019. Nevertheless, continued robust economic growth will contribute to a further narrowing of the deficit in the coming years; we expect it to average only 0.4% of GDP in 2018-22.
The public debt stock as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline gradually, from an estimated 79.5% in 2017 to just below 69% in 2022. Although the public finances will remain worse than in peers such as Germany or the Netherlands, the low interest rate environment and Austria's relatively strong fundamentals mean that funding risks are extremely low in our view.
Outlook for 2018-22: Monetary policy
The European Central Bank (ECB) is pursuing an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, with major policy interest rates at or below zero and a quantitative easing (QE) programme that ran at EUR60bn per month until the end of 2017, and is running at EUR30bn per month in January-September 2018. However, the ECB's view of the outlook improved markedly during 2017 and, although it remains dovish, we expect a more upbeat tone to emerge this year, and an end to monthly asset purchases under the QE programme by early 2019. Rising commodity prices and evidence of building domestic price pressure in some parts of the euro zone should mean that sufficient inflationary pressures will begin to emerge on the policy horizon in 2019-20. In response, we expect the ECB to take steps towards normalising its policy stance with an increase of 25 basis points in the main refinancing rate to 0.25% in early 2020, followed by five more rises that lift the main refinancing rate to 1.5% by end-2022. An increase in the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.4%, may come sooner, in 2019, easing the pressure on banks' lending margins and supporting profitability.
Outlook for 2018-22: Economic growth
Austria's initial recovery from the global financial crisis was respectable in the euro zone context, but subsequently the economy largely stalled and under-performed in comparison with regional peers, notably Germany. This was particularly striking given the traditionally high level of synchronisation between the two countries' business cycles. A faltering reform process in recent years contributed to higher inflation compared with regional peers and weakened productivity growth, admittedly from fairly high levels. However, the economic recovery gained significant momentum from the second half of 2016. Although in previous years the labour market had struggled to integrate the significant increase in the labour force, it seemed to have turned a corner in late 2016 and early 2017, owing in part to a surge in employment in the manu-facturing sector, and we expect a continued gradual improvement in labour market indicators in the coming years. This is supporting private consumption, which we expect to grow by 1.8% this year. Export and investment growth have also picked up. As a result, real GDP growth was 3.1% in 2017-above growth in Germany for the first time since 2005 and Austria's fastest growth rate since 2007.
We expect the current phase of catch-up growth-following an under-performance even compared with fundamentals in recent years-to continue this year, although we forecast slower growth, at 2.5%, as we expect the impulse from the manufacturing sector in 2017 to have largely been a one-off. In the following years we expect a further moderation of growth, to around its potential growth rate. Driven by the improvement of the labour market, domestic demand will be the main driver of growth. We expect average real GDP growth of 1.7% in 2019-22. Government policy is likely to be supportive of growth in the coming years, and the main risks are external. As a highly open economy, Austria is vulnerable to global economic developments, including any shocks to global trade in the case of a potential trade war between the US and the EU.
Outlook for 2018-22: Inflation
Annual consumer price inflation (EU harmonised) has been subdued in recent years, but higher than in most other euro zone countries. Inflation averaged 0.9% in 2015-16-well above average inflation in Germany and the euro zone. This largely reflects structural domestic factors such as higher unit wage costs, more regulated markets, and a period of faster increases in taxes and duties. Rising services prices and energy price base effects fostered a gradual increase in inflation in 2017, leading to a full-year average of 2.2%. The recent strengthening of the euro will weigh slightly on inflation, but we expect price growth to stay above the euro zone average in 2018-22, at 2% on average, as similar structural factors seen in previous years persist.
Outlook for 2018-22: Exchange rates
For most of 2015-16 the euro moved in a relatively narrow range around US$1.10:EUR1, before a sharp appreciation in the value of the US dollar following the presidential election in the US led to a year-end rate of US$1.05:EUR1. However, in 2017 the euro rallied as the region's economic recovery strength-ened and expectations of QE tapering increased, and as political risk waned in Europe but rose in the US. The exchange rate peaked at almost US$1.25:EUR1 at the beginning of February 2018 and stabilised at just below this level in March. The value of the euro could yet come under pressure from political risk-especially in the wake of the March 2018 general election in Italy-and monetary tightening in the US. Nevertheless, we expect a gradual appreciation on average, to US$1.21:EUR1 by 2020-21, as the euro is supported by an ongoing recovery in the region and receives structural support from a large current-account surplus, while the business cycle downturn in the US will weigh on the value of the dollar in 2020. Thereafter we expect the euro to appreciate to US$1.24:EUR1 on average in 2022.
Outlook for 2018-22: External sector
Low oil prices and subdued domestic demand compressing import values helped the trade balance to move into surplus in recent years, from a deficit in 2009-13. We expect this trade surplus to decline gradually, with the account moving into deficit from 2019 as robust export growth is outweighed by higher import costs and strengthening domestic demand pushes up import volumes. However, this will be compensated for by a healthy surplus on the services balance, driven in large part by robust tourist inflows. Modest primary income surpluses will not be enough to outweigh consistent secondary income deficits. However, the services balance will ensure that the current-account surplus remains broadly flat throughout 2018-22, at 2% of GDP on average.
