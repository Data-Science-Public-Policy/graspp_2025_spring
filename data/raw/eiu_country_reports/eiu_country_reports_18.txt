Full text: - Angela Merkel, the chancellor, leads a grand coalition of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU)-along with its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU)-and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). At the September federal election, Mrs Merkel will step down from her 16-year tenure as chancellor, marking the end of a political era. The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that the election will lead to a CDU/CSU-Greens coalition, which we expect to be less fractious than the current coalition, leading to increased political stability. Policymaking will remain centrist and consensus-oriented. The parties share similar views on economic and climate change policies, and on policy towards Russia. Frictions can be expected on fiscal policy, however, where the CDU/CSU will seek to take a more hawkish stance, and on relations with China, where The Greens will be more openly critical.

- Germany's score in our business environment model rises from 8.15 in the historical period (2016-20) to 8.31 in the forecast period (2021-25). The country rises to second place among its regional peers, behind only Switzerland. The improvements largely reflect three factors: effective mitigation of the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic; ongoing reform efforts; and a bounce-back in real GDP and trade volumes from the 2020 slump. Constraints on the ranking include a high tax burden on labour income and on firms, alongside high administrative costs. Key strengths of the business environment are political stability, a skilled labour force, openness to trade and investment, and a strong research and innovation framework.

- We expect the German economy to make a quicker recovery than the west European average, after a less severe hit to growth in 2020. This reflects the large industrial sector, which was less affected by lockdown measures than the services sector, and growing demand in China and other Asian markets, which is benefiting export-oriented businesses. Government support and stimulus measures have been generous, and as the vaccination programme progresses we expect a return to robust economic activity, from the second half of 2021. A poor demographic outlook will increasingly constrain growth; policy priorities for the medium term include responding to technological disruption in the automotive sector (especially electric vehicles) and boosting green and digital capabilities.

- The pandemic in 2020 resulted in a higher death rate, lower net immigration and slightly fewer births than in 2019, and hence there was no population growth for the first time in nine years. We forecast that the population will increase marginally in 2021-22 as the impact of the pandemic recedes, before beginning a longer-term trend of decline. As elsewhere in Europe, the population is ageing, with the old-age dependency ratio expected to rise throughout the forecast period and the working-age population already in decline, putting pressure on pension and healthcare costs.

- Germany will remain the world's fourth-largest economy at market exchange rates in 2025, and the largest EU economy. It is the largest consumer market in Europe by population, but demand is constrained by a substantial tax wedge and high savings rates. The pandemic severely disrupted parts of the retail sector, and a shift towards e-commerce will continue after restrictions are eased. The changing age profile will do much to shape demand. The consumer market will remain characterised by a preference for inexpensive goods for most day-to-day needs and high-quality purchases in special circumstances.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.

- Our forecast for the economy's long-term average annual growth rate is 1.5%, slowing from 2% in 2021-30 to 1.3% in 2031-50. The poor demographic outlook is the main driver of this weakening overall growth rate, as total factor productivity will remain supportive of growth, as will capital spending. The picture looks slightly more favourable on a per-head basis. Germany has many attributes that are conducive to sustainable long-term growth, including a highly skilled workforce, stable institutions and openness to innovation. Its openness to trade will ensure continued efforts to protect the multilateral trading system.

a Actual.
Background: The modern German state was founded in 1870. After the second world war (1939-45), Germany was divided into two parts: a liberal parliamentary democracy in the west and a totalitarian communist regime in the east. On October 3rd 1990, after the end of the Soviet Union's hegemony in central and eastern Europe, Germany was reunified.
Political structure: Germany is a federation of 16 states, or Länder, each of which has its own constitution, government and parliament. The states are primarily responsible for policing and education. The federal parliament comprises the directly elected Bundestag (the lower house) and the Bundesrat (the upper house) of representatives of the state governments. The federal chancellor, the head of the executive, is elected by the Bundestag and can be brought down only by the election of a successor. In March 2018 a grand coalition was once again formed, comprising the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD).
Policy issues: Short-term priorities focus on the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the resulting economic crisis and the rollout of the vaccination programme. Medium-term priorities include managing the transition of the automotive sector towards lower-emission vehicles; building industrial sovereignty and increasing the resilience of supply chains; managing rising tensions with Russia and China; implementing the rollout of fifth-generation (5G) technology, alongside continuing progress on the Industry 4.0 initiative; and transitioning the energy sector away from coal and nuclear power. Investment spending will increase in our forecast period (2021-25) compared with recent years.
Taxation: The federal corporation tax rate was cut from 25% to 15% in 2008. The effective corporate tax rate, including a municipal trade tax and a solidarity tax, is about 30-33%. The solidarity tax will be phased out from 2021. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45%. Social security contributions are shared equally between employers and employees. The main value-added tax (VAT) rate is 19%, but was temporarily reduced to 16% during the second half of 2020.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus came to US$248.4bn in 2019, with export earnings at almost US$1.5trn and import costs at just over US$1.2trn. Germany's single largest goods export market is still the EU, but the country has been more successful than most in diversifying its markets and selling into fast-growing emerging markets over the past decade.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Germany is a federal democracy, with major powers delegated to the 16 states (Länder). In March 2018 the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) re-formed their grand coalition following a protracted coalition-building process. Initial efforts had focused on creating a coalition comprising the CDU/CSU, The Greens and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), but these floundered and the FDP withdrew, making this an option that the parties may be cautious about pursuing again following the 2021 election. The main opposition party is the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), but political co-operation with the AfD is out of the question for the mainstream parties. The bicameral parliament comprises the Bundestag (the lower house of parliament), whose members are elected on a system of modified proportional representation, and the Bundesrat (the upper house), which consists of representatives of the 16 state governments. The coalition has a majority in the Bundestag, but not in the Bundesrat.

Political outlook: Political stability Angela Merkel, the chancellor, leads a grand coalition comprising the centre-right CDU-along with its Bavarian sister party, the CSU-and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). At the September federal election, Mrs Merkel will step down from her 16-year tenure as chancellor-a turning-point for Germany's political landscape. However, policymaking will remain centrist and consensus-oriented.
Mrs Merkel's already high approval ratings have risen during the coronavirus pandemic, with voters reassured by her calm demeanour, respect for scientific advice and recognised ability to manage crises. Germany's response to the public health crisis has been notable for stronger testing than its European peers, and for a more localised response-both made possible by the country's decentralised administrative structure. Excess hospital capacity also proved an advantage. However, the second wave over the winter has seen tensions rise between federal and state-level authorities over the appropriate level of restrictions. Social unrest and "pandemic fatigue" have also emerged, with protests against social distancing and mask-wearing rules, especially in Berlin, the capital. Nevertheless, all 16 German states agreed to extend the lockdown into March, from its intended expiry on February 14th, owing to the threat posed by virus mutations in neighbouring countries.
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that the September federal election will lead to a CDU/CSU-Greens coalition, with the CDU's chancellor candidate succeeding Mrs Merkel. Armin Laschet, the centrist governor of North Rhine-Westphalia, was chosen as the CDU's new party leader on January 16th (in line with our forecast), but will not necessarily become its chancellor candidate, given his unspectacular poll ratings. Markus Söder, the CSU leader and governor of Bavaria, has won increasing support among party members and the public during the pandemic. Although he has not yet declared his intention to run, we consider him the most likely choice. The decision on a candidate will be taken only after the state elections in March, either by the CDU/CSU leadership or its parliamentary deputies (there is no fixed process).
We would expect a CDU/CSU-Green coalition to be less fractious than the current coalition, leading to increased political stability. The parties share similar views on economic and climate change policies, and on policy towards Russia. Frictions could be expected on fiscal policy, however, where the CDU/CSU will seek a more hawkish stance, and relations with China, where The Greens will be more openly critical.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness The quality of administration is high, and the implementation of policies that have been passed by the federal parliament is sound. The federal structure of the government means that considerable responsibility falls on the 16 states that constitute the federal republic. An advantage of this is that many issues are decided with the closer democratic involvement of the electorate. States have a strong incentive to improve their own quality of governance, as comparisons with other states are easy to make, although one drawback is that the quality of public services such as education remains heterogeneous across states. Another disadvantage is that co-ordination can be difficult in policy areas in which the states have a large role. This has been the case in recent years. For instance, although the federal government had allocated additional funds for infrastructure investment, lower governments were often unable to use these for additional investment owing to capacity constraints. More recently, the coronavirus pandemic elicited different responses in different states, and caused a rise in tensions between the federal government (which was pushing for stricter restrictions) and state-level authorities (attuned to local business needs).
The design of the system also means that the constitutional powers enjoyed by the Bundesrat may, on occasion, limit the ability of the federal government to push through reforms in the face of opposition at state level (state interests are represented in the Bundesrat). However, the upper house does not have the right of veto on all aspects of legislation, and the proportion of laws requiring its approval was reduced in 2006. In exchange for this loss of influence over federal legislation, the states gained greater influence over the implementation of federal laws and some additional powers, particularly in education.
Majority governments are the norm in Germany at both the federal and the state levels. This generally ensures smooth policymaking, as the coalition agreement usually sets out in advance what the government will be working on throughout its term. The current grand coalition endured considerable internal frictions in the first half of its term, with the SPD's efforts to differentiate itself more clearly from the CDU hampering policymaking. However, the pandemic put an end to this by pushing the government on to a crisis footing. We expect another majority coalition after the September election, with considerable policy overlap between the governing parties, resulting in a continuation of effective policymaking in Germany.
Political outlook: Election watch The next federal election is scheduled for September 26th, and will result in a change in chancellor for the first time since 2005. State elections in Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate in March give early insights into voter support for the CDU, the SPD and The Greens. Poor results for the CDU in these elections increase the likelihood of Mr Söder being chosen as chancellor candidate over Mr Laschet.
At the federal level, opinion polls have been fairly consistent in recent months, with the CDU/CSU polling around 35%, the Greens 19%, the SPD 16%, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) 9%, and the Left Party and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) each on 7%. This suggests that the CDU/CSU should be able to win a majority with The Greens. However, there are two "known unknowns". First, the impending departure of Mrs Merkel, who remains Germany's most popular politician, might not yet be reflected in the CDU's polling numbers. Second, continued slow progress in Germany's coronavirus vaccination programme could weaken the CDU's popularity.
Voter fragmentation will continue in 2021, but parties on the political extremes (the Left Party, and the AfD on the far right) are likely to remain excluded from mainstream debate and from any governing coalition. An SPD-Green-Left Party coalition might be a mathematical possibility, but the uncompromising stance of the Left Party makes this unlikely. Should the CDU/CSU-Greens fail to win a majority, they could be joined by the FDP or perhaps the SPD-although the latter is keen to avoid another grand coalition.
Political outlook: International relations The European economic recovery fund clears the way for joint debt issuance (worth EUR750bn) to be channelled to EU member states with lower living standards and those hardest hit by the pandemic. From mid-2021 about EUR390bn is to be transferred in grants and the remainder through loans. The size of the fund is modest, but it will help to increase fiscal space in highly leveraged countries; Germany's U-turn on joint debt issuance in May 2020 was crucial to the agreement. The fund is a landmark step for the bloc, as it establishes a precedent for the EU to issue debt to fund common needs.
We expect US-EU relations to improve under the new US president, Joe Biden. Mr Biden will prefer diplomacy to tariffs, reducing the threat of a US-EU trade war. He is already returning the US to a number of multilateral platforms, including the Paris Agreement on climate change. However, on other issues-including OECD-level negotiations on a digital services tax, and EU links with China-relations will remain strained.
Other EU external relations came under strain in late 2020. The poisoning of Alexei Navalny, a Russian opposition activist, prompted an unusually hawkish German response. We do not expect Germany to halt construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in the near term, but it may take other punitive measures against Russia. Following the expulsion of European diplomats (including Germans) from Russia, Germany expelled Russian diplomats in early February, sending EU-Russian relations to their lowest point since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. The EU and China have agreed in principle to conclude negotiations on a Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, but ratification by the European Parliament will be challenging, given European concerns about human rights and labour standards, and restrictions on allowing Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications firm, to build fifth-generation (5G) telecoms infrastructure.

The economy will remain resilient, with effective mitigation of the pandemic Germany's score in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment model rises from 8.15 in the historical period (2016-20) to 8.31 in the forecast period (2021-25). The country jumps three places in our global ranking to fifth, and rises to second place among its 17 regional peers, behind Switzerland. The improvements largely reflect three factors: the country's solid institutional framework and macroeconomic fundamentals, which helped to mitigate the economic shock of the pandemic; ongoing reform efforts aimed at strengthening network infrastructure, the financing environment and the economy's overall technological capacity; and a bounce-back in some indicators from the 2020 slump (especially GDP and trade data in the market opportunities category).
Germany's main strengths are its skilled labour force, stable political culture, openness to foreign trade and investment, established supply-chain linkages, and world-class research and innovation. It has strong legal and regulatory structures, a mature democratic system, efficient public administration and a broadly pro-business policy orientation. Parts of the financial sector are being tested by the pandemic fallout, but we expect the financing environment to remain resilient, in view of earlier macroprudential reforms and extensive policy support. Volatile global trading conditions will dampen the score for foreign trade and exchange controls. Policy towards greenfield foreign investment will remain broadly favourable, but an increasing focus on "protecting" national sovereignty will lead to tighter investment screening rules. Network infrastructure is extensive, but ageing in some areas and its quality lags that of many regional peers. The tax regime places a substantial burden on labour income, while a poor demographic outlook holds down the labour market score. A focus on climate change and efforts to phase out nuclear and coal use will have implications for tax policy, energy costs and automotive production.

Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Policy still broadly welcoming towards greenfield foreign direct investment, but further tightening of foreign takeover rules and investment screening (particularly for non-EU inflows), amid concerns over intellectual property leakage.
2023-25: Geopolitical fallout from the pandemic encourages support for "strategic sectors" and industrial sovereignty.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Moderate bounce-back in world trade, but pressure on German export sector eases only gradually, given subdued global demand, ongoing US-China trade tensions and supply-chain disruption. EU-Mercosur trade deal delays continue.
2023-25: Steady decline in post-Brexit UK-EU crossborder trade. EU makes further gradual progress on bilateral trade deals.
Taxes 2021-22: No changes planned to headline tax rates. New modest tax-relief measures in 2021 (higher tax-free allowance and benefits) amid wider accommodative stance. Value-added tax (VAT) cut in hospitality sector extended to end-2022.
2023-25: Increased focus on environmental taxes. Comparatively high labour tax burden persists. Possible new digital taxes.
Financing 2021-22: Monetary policy remains highly accommodative, holding down banks' funding costs but also margins and profitability. Most business lending risk during the pandemic assumed by state-backed loan-guarantee schemes.
2023-25: Operating conditions for banks remain challenging. Ongoing efforts to attract financial services firms from the UK.
The labour market 2021-22: The Kurzarbeit wage-subsidy scheme remains in place until at least end-2021. Gradual tightening of some parameters.
2023-25: Risk of unequal scarring effects hitting less-protected labour market groups, such as young and older workers, and part-time female cohort. Rising structural challenges posed by ageing demographics and increasing share of migrant workers.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Higher investment in healthcare. Focus on improvements to rail network and digital infrastructure, such as ultra-fast broadband. Ongoing energy transition focuses on emissions and coal-usage reduction, and improvement of power grid.
2023-25: Steady rollout of policy measures to meet medium-term climate targets, including gradual phase-out of coal.
Technological readiness 2021-22: The government prioritises upgrading the country's digital infrastructure and investing in artificial intelligence.

Before the pandemic, domestic demand in Germany had been resilient, underpinned by robust job creation, real wage gains, historically low borrowing costs and wealth effects from a dynamic housing market. These conditions supported a firm expansion of most private-sector services and construction activity. The large export-oriented industrial sector had faced a more challenging backdrop, amid heightened world trade tensions, Brexit-related uncertainty and structural disruption in the automotive industry. The pandemic and accompanying synchronised slump in global trade delivered a severe shock to the economy-unevenly distributed across sectors-although the downturn was on a smaller scale than in other large European countries, partly owing to huge policy support and the exposure of the large manufacturing sector to the more quickly rebounding Chinese economy.
Scarring effects from the pandemic may constrain the business environment Germany's economic recovery will be gradual and uneven. The unprecedented scale of policy support deployed in response to the crisis has so far worked well to mitigate disruption in labour and financial markets, but there is a risk that scarring effects will emerge as support is wound down. Germany's still fairly strong macroeconomic fundamentals (in a regional context) work in its favour, with a high employment rate, resilient public finances, modest household debt, an external surplus and a large competitive export sector, backed by a strong institutional framework. Set against this, however, are structural weaknesses that could be exposed by the fallout from the pandemic. A period of low business investment and infrastructure spending, alongside ageing demographics and an increasingly protectionist global trading environment, does not augur well for productivity trends and potential growth. The disruptive impact of new technologies and rising environmental pressures on the country's large automotive and energy sectors will also pose major policy challenges, with implications for investment and regional disparities.

Policy towards private enterprise and competition is generally liberal, and will remain so, although state involvement in the economy has increased in response to the pandemic (as in most European countries) and will remain at a higher level than in the pre-crisis period. Private enterprise in Germany is supported by a robust institutional framework, a stable legal code, strong research and innovation capacity and an extensive network of global and regional supply chains. The competition authority, the Federal Cartel Office, is reasonably efficient. However, Germany fares less well in other areas, with restricted competition in services, a fairly complex corporate tax regime, only modest entrepreneurial activity and a high administrative burden for new firms. Overall, the regulatory framework for companies is reasonable, but lags some regional peers. Administrative processes for accessing utilities and credit, obtaining permits, enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency are fairly straightforward. In contrast, the number of procedures and costs to set up a new business is well above the high-income OECD average, tax administration is often complex and costly, and property registration can be protracted. A third Bureaucracy Relief Act was implemented in late 2019 to reduce business red tape and improve digitisation.

- Before the pandemic, levels of state involvement in the economy were moderate. The federal government's major holdings include the national railway operator, Deutsche Bahn (100%); the former telecommunications monopoly, Deutsche Telekom (32%); the former postal monopoly, Deutsche Post (21%); and the country's second-largest financial institution, Commerzbank (16%). We do not expect any sell-offs of state-owned stakes in the medium term. The state also plays a major role in the financing of firms and investments, via the wholly state-owned KfW (the largest national development bank in Europe, and an even more important player in the German private sector since the start of the pandemic) and a broad framework of public-sector savings banks, which are mostly owned by local authorities and geared towards small businesses.

The pandemic will result in a much larger state hand in the economy
- State involvement in the economy has increased significantly during the pandemic, in the form of a hugely expanded wage-subsidy furlough scheme (Kurzarbeit); direct grants to firms in the worst-affected sectors (such as hospitality, travel and tourism); extensive state-backed loan and export guarantees; a EUR100bn fund to recapitalise and acquire stakes in affected companies; and increased state aid (major recipients include Deutsche Bahn; Lufthansa, Germany's largest airline; and TUI, a travel group). A temporary relaxation of EU state-aid rules is expected to continue until at least 2022. Many support measures will be wound down as affected businesses and sectors become viable again. However, significant take-up of state-guaranteed financing and the expansion of state equity holdings and state-aid subsidies imply a sustained higher level of post-crisis state involvement, with a risk of market distortions in some sectors.
- In late 2019 the government published a new National Industrial Strategy 2030. Alongside broad objectives to strengthen innovation and improve competitiveness, there was a strong implied shift towards greater state intervention in industry sectors, support for "national and regional champions", and protection for firms deemed to be of "strategic importance" to the economy. This reflects concern over market access of foreign companies (particularly state-owned or heavily subsidised firms), related issues of intellectual property and cyber-security, and the ability of EU-based firms to compete with US and Chinese rivals. The fallout from the pandemic will intensify such concerns, implying a strong domestic policy focus on the "protection" of industrial sovereignty.
- Liberalisation of product markets has progressed gradually, but levels of regulation in services remain more restrictive than in most EU member states, with high barriers to competition in some utilities and transport sectors, retail, and business services such as architecture, engineering and legal. Significant improvements in this area are unlikely in the medium term.

Policy towards foreign direct investment (FDI) will remain fairly liberal (as in most EU countries), but screening procedures for FDI have been steadily tightened in recent years and this trend will continue, alongside a more interventionist stance on foreign takeovers. This reflects the global shift towards protectionism and hardening sentiment at the regional level towards non-EU inflows in 'strategic' sectors. Germany has attracted considerable inbound investment over recent decades, primarily from other European countries, the US and Japan. Inflows from China have risen steadily since 2015, albeit from a low base. On the whole, foreign and domestic investors are treated equally in terms of investment incentives and protection of real and intellectual property. Limitations on foreign control traditionally applied only to "sensitive" sectors, such as media, defence and some critical infrastructure. However, the tighter FDI screening provisions imply that more prospective foreign investments or acquisitions across a wider range of sectors will now be subject to review. Restrictions on hostile takeovers are considerable, whether the acquirer is foreign or domestic, and notice of strategic goals and "acting in concert" is mandatory for large investments. There are a range of federal and state-level incentives aimed at attracting FDI, with a focus on support for research and innovation. Germany Trade and Invest (GTAI) is the federal body responsible for FDI affairs, with the state-owned development bank, KfW, the main provider of financing support.
FDI screening has increased in recent years
- Germany was a strong advocate of a new EU-wide framework for tighter screening of non-EU FDI-fully implemented in October 2020-and in recent years has progressively strengthened the country's investment screening rules. This follows a period of increased Chinese (and other foreign) acquisitions of German firms, which has raised concerns over the involvement of state-backed foreign actors in strategic infrastructure assets and the transfer of technological knowledge and intellectual property. Historically, the government had the power to review (and potentially veto) new investment projects or acquisitions of equity stakes above 25% in German companies by non-EU investors if the transactions were deemed to pose a risk to national security. A series of amendments since 2019 have lowered this threshold to 10% for investments in "critical infrastructure", significantly expanded the range of sectors that this encompasses (to include many areas of energy, telecoms, transport, healthcare, finance and information technology) and also broadened its interpretation of "national security risk" to cover the potential impact on all EU member states. A further extension of the screening regime is planned later in 2021 to cover artificial intelligence, biotechnology, robotics and semiconductors. These tighter screening requirements will remain in place in 2022 and beyond.
- A global trend in recent years has been an increasing share of FDI activity reflecting "corporate reconfigurations"-changes in multinational ownership structures-that have a minimal impact on output, employment and capital in the host economy. We expect this to continue over the forecast period.

Germany's high score in this category reflects its traditional openness to foreign trade and its membership of the EU, which provides for freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and persons within the bloc. The slight fall in the score and rankings reflects the country's relative exposure to the underlying deterioration in global trading conditions, amid increased protectionism, Brexit disruption, UK-EU vaccine rows and heightened US-China tensions. No tariffs or quotas are permitted within the EU and most other non-tariff restrictions have been abolished. The EU trades with Norway and Iceland under the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), has a range of bilateral agreements with Switzerland and a customs union with Turkey. Only agriculture is excluded from all these arrangements. Trade with other non-EU countries is mostly subject to moderate customs duties. A range of bilateral and regional agreements provide for lower or zero tariffs and co-operation on non-tariff barriers.

- After a slump in 2020, Germany's large export-oriented industrial sector will benefit from a strengthening of global trade flows in 2021-22, although supply-chain disruptions will make the recovery uneven. The fallout from the pandemic will exacerbate existing geopolitical trends such as rising protectionism and the shift in economic power from West to East. This could lead to more regionalised "nearshoring" of supply chains. The EU's trading relations with China, the US and the UK will face significant challenges in the forecast period.

Trade talks will focus on bilateral deals in a more protectionist global context
- In recent years the EU has finalised free-trade agreements (FTAs) with Canada, Singapore, Vietnam and Japan, upgraded its deal with Mexico and launched trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand. A provisional agreement was reached in 2019 between the EU and Mercosur (the South American trading bloc) that would create the world's largest free-trade market of almost 800m people. However, concerns in some member states over aspects of the deal (mostly related to agriculture and climate) have raised uncertainty over its future implementation. Little progress is likely in 2021.
- The EU and the UK finalised their Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) in December 2020. This limited FTA in theory provides for zero-tariff, zero-quota trade, easing uncertainty for business (although future regulatory divergence could see new tariffs). The TCA implies a 'hard Brexit' with substantial new non-tariff trade barriers. Services trade is barely covered in the TCA and many regulatory issues remain unresolved, pointing to ongoing negotiations in 2021-25. We expect EU-UK relations to remain fraught in our forecast period.
- In late 2020 the EU and China agreed in principle on a Comprehensive Agreement on Investment. The deal is modest in scope and detail, mostly covering non-binding commitments, with limited benefits. The deal did not include any commitments from China on state subsidies or improved labour rights. Ratification by the European Parliament in 2021 is highly unlikely, but the prospects for this will improve during the French presidency of the EU in 2022.

The tax regime remains one of the weaker areas of Germany's business environment and, with only minor changes expected over the forecast period, the country falls back in the global and regional rankings. The tax/GDP ratio has risen gradually in recent years and was 41.7% in 2019 (latest comparable Eurostat data), close to the euro zone average. Direct taxes on personal income and net social security contributions (labour taxes) account for a higher than average share of tax receipts. A lower proportion of revenue is derived from taxes on corporate income, goods and services, such as value-added tax (VAT), the environment and wealth. A progressive income-tax system levies rates ranging from 14% to 42% on taxable income between EUR9,740 and EUR57,920 (in 2021). The 42% rate then applies to income up to EUR274,600, above which there is a 45% top rate. Since 1991 there has been an additional "solidarity surcharge"-a 5.5% levy on income to finance reunification costs-but in January 2021 this was abolished for most taxpayers, with a tapered scale for higher earners. Almost all employees must pay social security contributions into insurance funds covering pensions, healthcare, unemployment and long-term care. Contribution rates range from 18.6% of gross salary (split equally between employees and employer) for pensions to about 3% for long-term care and unemployment insurance. The standard VAT rate is 19%, slightly less than the EU average, with a reduced rate of 7% on certain goods and services.
Tax burden will remain high on labour income and companies
- Despite an extended pre-pandemic period of robust jobs growth in Germany, the tax system is not especially supportive of employment or private investment, with a relatively high tax burden on labour income and companies. In 2019 the average single worker faced a 'tax wedge' of 49.4%, the second-highest in the OECD. This high burden-particularly affecting low-income workers-and in some cases very high marginal tax rates act as a disincentive for second earners and contribute to Germany's relatively modest full-time employment rate for women. The effective tax burden for most companies is also elevated, despite a comparatively low headline federal corporation tax rate of 15%. After including the impact of a local trade tax (Gewerbesteuer) and other leveies, the effective average corporation tax rate is estimated at around 30%, compared with an EU average of about 21%. A new research and development (R&D) tax incentive took effect in early 2020. The overall tax regime for companies will remain fairly complex, contributing to high compliance costs and favouring debt over equity, constraining the venture-capital market.
- A temporary six-month cut in VAT rates (standard: 19% to 16%; reduced: 7% to 5%) in response to the pandemic expired at end-2020, along with the option to defer selected tax payments for individuals and businesses. The government has extended the period of a lowered VAT rate of 7% in the hospitality sector until end-2022 and expanded a corporate loss carryback facility.
- Coronavirus-related developments could trigger further near-term moves in tax policy, but there are no plans for changes in headline tax rates. The forecast period will see an increased focus on digital and environmental taxation (the latter will be especially the case should The Greens, as expected, enter the federal government, in late 2021). A new carbon pricing system was introduced in 2021, alongside various new "carrot and stick" tax-related measures affecting transport use and energy efficiency. The government plans to cut the renewable energy levy on households, but there will be upward pressure elsewhere on energy costs. Germany strongly supports OECD-driven efforts to establish global rules for corporate taxation, including digital levies on the US technology giants.

The German financial sector has handled the fallout from the pandemic reasonably well, reflecting its improved resilience over the past decade and the stabilising effects of huge monetary and fiscal support measures. The banking sector entered the crisis with reasonably strong capital buffers: at end-2019 the Tier 1 capital-adequacy ratio was 16.5%, and non-performing loans were just 1.1% of total loans. However, the crisis is amplifying existing vulnerabilities, such as weak revenue growth and low bank profitability, and balance sheets are coming under increased pressure from defaults and loan losses across the corporate and household sectors as policy support is wound down. Bank profitability in Germany has traditionally been among the weakest in the EU. A major factor is the expansive three-tiered structure of the banking system, with the large private commercial banks and the state-owned regional lenders (Landesbanken) operating alongside an extensive network of (mostly non-profit) small local credit co-operatives and public-sector savings banks (owned by local authorities) that primarily service the Mittelstand (small and medium-sized enterprises). Banks face pressure on margins from the low interest-rate environment, rising digitisation costs and litigation pay-outs. These factors have contributed to large-scale cost-cutting programmes and job losses over recent years at Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, the country's two largest commercial financial institutions. Internally generated funds account for an above-average share of corporate financing in Germany, reflecting firms' lower reliance on capital markets than in most peer economies. Equity capital accounts for the largest share of funding, but is below the EU average. Bank credit was traditionally the preferred financing channel, being relatively cheap and available at long maturities, but demand has weakened over the past decade amid deleveraging.
Support for the financial sector during the pandemic proved substantial
- Alongside monetary easing by the European Central Bank-in the form of asset purchases and expanded liquidity schemes-domestic policymakers have deployed a range of credit support measures during the pandemic. The largest have been two state-backed loan-guarantee schemes totalling almost EUR850bn, channelled via the KfW public development bank and a newly created economic stabilisation fund (with EUR100bn also allocated to recapitalise and buy equity stakes in affected companies). As of early 2021, firms had taken up a fairly modest 20-25% of available loan guarantees, leaving a substantial buffer still available. Other measures have included loan-repayment deferrals, a cut in banks' countercyclical capital buffer to 0%, and the temporary easing by regulators of banks' capital and liquidity requirements. Heightened profitability and solvency pressures in the continued low-interest-rate environment could lead to a tightening of lending conditions. The increase in credit risk assumed by the state via its loan-guarantee schemes could create moral hazard and spur credit misallocation.

Germany's labour market is comparatively robust in regional terms, with high employment and low unemployment, a well-qualified labour force, established employer-employee relations, a respectable trend of nominal earnings growth, a statutory national minimum wage and a well-respected apprenticeship system. A sustained period of solid headline labour market indicators before the onset of the pandemic was partly a reflection of healthy domestic demand, but can also be traced to the impact of (often contentious) liberalising reforms implemented by past governments. There are some less positive features of the labour market. Although the overall female employment rate is comparatively high, participation of women in full-time employment is modest, constrained by limited childcare availability (reforms since 2017 have aimed to strengthen this) and tax disincentives for second earners. There is a significant gap between the employment rates of female EU and non-EU nationals (more so than for men), implying transition issues into the labour market for those with a migrant background, and underused labour resources. Across the economy as a whole, the share of low-skill, low-wage employment has increased steadily over the past decade. The employment prospects (and the participation rate) of older workers have improved, but Germany's ageing population still poses challenges.
The Kurzarbeit scheme will continue to play an important role in 2021
- During the pandemic many countries have introduced wage-subsidy programmes similar to Germany's established short-time work scheme (Kurzarbeit), which played an important role in shielding the labour market during the global financial crisis, and since early 2020 has been instrumental in limiting job losses, and supporting workers' incomes and firms' liquidity, amid the economic downturn. It has allowed companies to retain workers with firm-specific skills, mitigating costs associated with lay-offs and future (re)hiring and training. The number of workers furloughed in the Kurzarbeit scheme peaked at just over 6m in mid-2020-about four times higher than during the global financial crisis in 2009. In early 2021 Germany's unemployment rate stood at 4.6% of the labour force, up by a relatively modest 1 percentage point (or around 500,000 people) from its pre-pandemic level. The Kurzarbeit as it stands will remain largely in place until end-2021 (a longer duration than in some peer countries), although some aspects will be tightened from mid-year. This will reduce the risk of a spike in joblessness, although a gradual increase in unemployment is likely.
- One of the notable features of the pandemic has been its highly unequal impact on different economic sectors and households, with a clear risk that this will lead to widening inequality. There is concern that the labour market impact will be disproportionately concentrated among certain groups, such as the young, the lower skilled, women (who comprise a majority of employees in the worst-affected contact-intensive sectors) and more elderly workers. This could lead to a decline in employment rates across such groups, with implications for labour supply in the future and for growth potential.

Infrastructure is solid but ageing; greater capital investment needed The quality of infrastructure has traditionally been a strength of the business environment, but a lengthy period of subdued public and private capital investment has resulted in a gradual deterioration of standards, constraining progress in digitalisation and raising capacity concerns in the government's energy transition policy (Energiewende) towards renewables. We expect some improvement over the forecast period, with public investment plans targeted towards digital infrastructure, social housing, the electric vehicle (EV) sector and a ten-year rail network modernisation programme. But weaknesses will persist and plans could be impeded by the pandemic fallout and capacity constraints in the construction sector. Transport infrastructure is well developed, but years of spending restraint have heightened road congestion and repair backlogs, and poor co-ordination between different levels of government has hindered high-speed rail projects and the planned Fehmarn Belt link with Denmark. The Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan (FTIP) earmarks around 1,000 projects up to 2030, but implementation in most cases will remain dependent on attracting large private-sector investment (the record for which is mixed) and overcoming longstanding regulatory hurdles such as complex planning rules. The mobile telecoms and broadband markets are competitive, but coverage and take-up of ultra-fast broadband (and availability of 4G mobile services) lag most regional peers. Planned improvements to fibre coverage and ongoing 4G/5G network builds will narrow the urban-rural divide, but meeting a 2025 nationwide coverage target for gigabit-ready broadband will be challenging. Expanding digitisation-along with pandemic-driven shifts towards greater remote working and less business travel-and rising consumer demand will continue to drive improvements in mobile and broadband penetration.

- Following years of delays and budget overruns, Germany's new flagship airport, Berlin-Brandenburg, opened in late 2020. The airline sector has been hit especially hard by the pandemic and faces a highly uncertain outlook, even assuming a rebound in travel demand. The country's largest airline, Lufthansa, received a EUR9bn bail­out in mid-2020 and additional state support for the sector could be needed (and would be forthcoming).
- The post-Fukushima decision by the government in 2011 to phase out domestic nuclear power by 2022 has driven a strong shift towards renewables, subsidies for which have contributed to comparatively high household energy bills. Germany has significantly expanded renewables generation-mostly solar and wind-power-but progress towards climate targets has been hindered by sluggish power-grid development and continued high dependence on heavily polluting coal. The country's first major climate action law in late 2019 set firm 2030 emission targets and other objectives, and also included a new carbon pricing system and a planned exit date of 2038 from domestic coal-fired power generation. Progress will be challenging, however, given the influence of coal-mining regions and the automotive sector.

Germany scores highly on a regional and global basis for technological readiness, owing to the scope of its digital infrastructure, strong e-commerce and e-business penetration, above-average digital skill levels, the national Industry 4.0 initiative aimed at supporting digital manufacturing, and a well-developed framework for research and innovation. Weaker aspects are the comparatively slow pace of ultrafast broadband rollout, modest digital adoption (and innovation activity) by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), rising digital skills shortages and the limited scope of e-government services. Total investment in R&D was 3.2% of GDP in 2019, one of the highest ratios in the EU. R&D intensity has trended steadily higher over the past decade, driven primarily by large firms in medium- and high-tech manufacturing sectors (the automotive industry is a major driver). An official target is to raise total R&D investment to 3.5% of GDP by 2025. In recent years Germany has slipped from being an "innovation leader" to a "strong innovator", according to the European Commission's Innovation Scoreboard. Germany scores well in terms of business investment and public-private linkages, but lags its peers in entrepreneurship and financing support. Berlin is the largest hub for entrepreneurial dynamism in Germany, but national indicators of innovative high-growth firms, start-up activity and SME innovations have weakened over recent years. Germany has a National Cyber Response Centre and adopted its second national cyber-security strategy in 2016 (an update is expected in the next few years). According to the Global Cybersecurity Index, published by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in 2019, Germany was ranked 22nd in terms of its commitment and capacity to deal with the threat from cybercrime and cyber-espionage.
The rollout of 5G and investment in artificial intelligence will be priorities
- The current government's digital policy is largely a continuation of its predecessor's "Digital Strategy 2025". This envisages the deployment of a nationwide gigabit-capable infrastructure network by 2025. Coverage obligations based on the 5G auction completed in mid-2019 include a requirement to supply 98% of households with minimum speeds of 100 Mbps by end-2022 and national roaming rules for network sharing that seek to encourage new market entry. The government's main pandemic stimulus package in mid-2020 allocated EUR6bn to create a state-funded infrastructure company to aid high-speed network builds in rural "white spot" areas. In late 2020 Germany tightened security laws covering 5G network suppliers, giving regulators the option to ban Huawei, a large Chinese telecoms equipment manufacturer, from the country's 5G programme.
- In late 2018 the government published a new national artificial intelligence (AI) strategy that earmarked a relatively modest EUR3bn of spending over a six-year period, with the aim of leveraging private-sector funding. The mid-2020 stimulus package included an extra EUR4bn of funding allocated to AI and investment in quantum computing and sixth-generation (6G) technologies, alongside measures to strengthen e-government services.

Economic forecast: Policy trends As elsewhere in Europe, Germany is now well into the second wave of the pandemic, which has proved much more severe than the first wave, putting strains on hospital capacity and rendering the test and trace system ineffective. A new stringent lockdown has been in place since December 16th and has been extended to March 7th. From March, we expect a gradual phase-out of most restrictions in line with quicker progress in Germany's vaccination programme. The vaccine rollout has been sluggish: 4.4m doses had been administered as of February 16th (2.9m first doses and 1.5m second doses), equivalent to 5.11 per 100 people, which compares unfavourably to the UK's 23.75 and the US's 16.5. Nevertheless, we expect that 70% of the population will be vaccinated by September 2021.
The European Commission has temporarily relaxed its state-aid rules, given the exceptional circumstances. We do not expect their reimposition until 2022 or 2023. Germany's state-aid disbursements comprise about half of the EU total. Firms in receipt of state aid may come under pressure to promote sustainability and to pay taxes in Germany rather than in lower-tax jurisdictions.
Other ongoing areas of policy debate include how to build industrial sovereignty, raise the resilience of supply chains and support transformation of the automotive sector towards low-emission vehicles. With The Greens all but certain to join the next federal coalition, the CDU and the SPD will both present policy programmes with a green agenda in 2021. The government's decision to support electric vehicles but not the automotive sector more generally in 2020, despite the industry's large lobby and the fact that it accounts for about 830,000 jobs, is an indication of the policy direction.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy Fiscal indicators
(% of GDP)
  2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025
Government expenditure 49.8 50.1 47.6 46.5 46.6 46.4
Government revenue 45.0 46.1 45.5 45.6 45.9 46.0
Budget balance -4.8 -4.0 -2.1 -1.0 -0.7 -0.5
Government debt 69.7 72.9 70.8 68.4 67.0 65.3
After six years of fiscal surpluses, the budget shifted into deficit in 2020. Germany's fiscal support and stimulus programmes are the largest in Europe, with key components including the following:

- the Kurzarbeit programme, a furlough scheme that allows firms to cut employees' working hours without having to lay them off, with the state paying at least 60% of the lost net wage payments until end-2021;
- a EUR50bn solidarity fund to help small businesses and the self-employed, and liquidity support for companies that need assistance in paying loans, irrespective of their size, totalling EUR500bn;
- a EUR3.5bn cash injection into the healthcare system, and transfers to local governments to help to manage the crisis;
- a value-added tax (VAT) cut from 19% to 16% for July-December 2020, and a reduction in VAT for the hard-hit hospitality sector to 7% until mid-2021 and until end-2022 for meals in restaurants and cafés.
- cash transfers to businesses that are forced to close under the winter lockdown, along with new tax deductions announced in February.

Germany's expansionary fiscal policy will persist during 2021; we forecast a deficit of 4% of GDP, compared with 4.8% of GDP in 2020. The Kurzarbeit programme will remain in place throughout the year and capital expenditure will be higher than before the pandemic. Over the next four years, investment will be channelled to a wide range of sectors, from artificial intelligence (AI), to the 5G rollout, to innovation in automotive manufacturers. The health fund will receive a significant boost and a large chunk of the money will go to Germany's national hydrogen strategy, as part of its energy transition.
We expect Germany's public debt to peak at just under 73% of GDP in 2021, from around 60% in 2019. The government is taking advantage of an exception clause in the constitutional debt brake for crisis periods, lifting limits on new borrowing. The brake will remain suspended this year, but fiscal consolidation will then return-bringing the public debt/GDP ratio back to about 65% by end-2025, which is likely to lead to renewed tensions with southern EU members.

Long-term interest rate (av) -0.5 -0.4 -0.1 0.0 0.1 0.2
The monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) will remain highly accommodative until at least the end of 2023. The overnight interbank rate (EONIA) has been negative since October 2014 and stood at -0.48% in January. With policy rates at their effective lower bound, monetary policy is now conducted primarily through quantitative easing (QE). The ECB restarted asset purchases in November 2019 at an average monthly pace of EUR20bn, as the euro zone economy was slowing. In 2020 the ECB adopted further stimulus measures to contain the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus: an extra round of QE worth EUR120bn, a EUR1.85trn pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), liquidity injections at negative rates and easier capital and collateral requirements for banks. We expect the ECB to use the PEPP envelope in full; after EUR1.1trn of asset purchases in 2020, we expect purchases worth EUR1.1trn in 2021 and EUR460bn in 2022. The bank will maintain its QE programme into 2023, when we forecast that inflation will continue to undershoot its target of just below 2%. We do not expect policy rates to increase by the end of 2025.
The ECB's actions have prevented a credit crunch in the euro zone: borrowing costs for households and businesses are at historic lows and this will continue for the next few years, supporting the economic recovery. However, the pandemic poses challenges to credit markets: banks tightened credit standards for businesses in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 owing to increased risk perception, and collateral requirements have reached the highest value since the third quarter of 2009.

Economic forecast: Economic growth The impact of the coronavirus: global and regional assumptions The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that global output contracted by 4% in 2020 (an upgrade from a contraction of 4.3% in our previous forecasting round). In 2021 we expect global GDP to rebound by 4.5%, with growth in OECD countries reaching record-high levels. This sharp rebound will boost global GDP back to its pre-coronavirus level in late 2021. However, the pace of recovery will vary greatly across regions. Asia and North America will recover first, with real GDP back to pre-coronavirus levels as early as this year. The recovery will take longer in Europe and the Middle East and Africa region, stretching into 2022. Latin America will be a laggard, with real GDP returning to pre-coronavirus levels only in 2023.
The start of the rollout of several coronavirus vaccines in most developed economies has not altered our economic forecasts. In the coming months the vaccines will not be available in quantities large enough to be game-changing. Logistics and shipping will also be difficult. We therefore maintain our view that in most developed economies vaccines will not be widely distributed before late 2021 or early 2022. Access to the vaccine will be difficult initially as developed countries race to acquire sufficient quantities and poorer countries struggle to secure funding. The rollout in middle-income and emerging countries will take longer; we do not expect it to take place on a wide scale before at least end-2022. The picture appears even bleaker for low-income countries; we do not expect most of these states to have wide access to a vaccine before 2023, if at all. The slow pace of vaccine distribution creates significant risks for the global economy. This will hold back the global recovery and foster the emergence of new variants of the virus, which may prove resistant to current vaccines.
Europe was badly hit by the pandemic-induced economic downturn in 2020, with Spain and the UK suffering the largest recessions. Among the developed European economies, only Ireland is likely to have escaped a contraction, owing to its large multinational and pharmaceutical sectors. Year-on-year growth rates in 2021 will be misleading, as the economies that were worst-hit in spring 2020 (such as France) will grow the fastest, even as economic activity remains subdued, mainly because of base effects. We expect a more sustained pick-up among businesses and consumers in the second half of 2021, with EU real GDP returning to its 2019 level in 2022. This is a slower trajectory than we expect in the US, reflecting the EU's greater dependence on global export demand and a slower structural adjustment following the crisis. The second wave of the pandemic, during which cold winter temperatures and new variants have increased transmission rates, has been significantly worse than the first. In late 2020 many countries reimposed lockdowns and other restrictions such as curfews to prevent health services from being overwhelmed, and these remain in place across most major economies in western Europe in early 2021. Vaccination programmes are being rolled out, but there is a substantial variation in pace between countries, with the UK having administered at least one dose of a vaccine to 22% of the adult population by February 15th, while the EU average stood at around 4%.
The political and geopolitical effects of the crisis will be significant. The pandemic has resulted in an extraordinary expansion of executive powers, often with limited parliamentary oversight, and an unprecedented withdrawal of civil liberties. It has also become a testing time for central-local government relations, which have deteriorated in many countries owing to conflicts over power-sharing, policy responses and financial support. Elections have been cancelled or delayed in some countries, and have gone ahead in others in controversial circumstances. Governments' handling of the response will continue to face scrutiny. Public support for measures to combat the pandemic is fraying, and we expect social unrest to rise in 2021. Failure to address the social crisis triggered by the coronavirus could further erode trust in national institutions. The crisis may encourage support for the nation state, and a backlash against globalisation and open borders. It will also intensify the competition for global leadership between China and the US, and a realignment of geopolitical spheres of influence may ensue in Europe, Africa and other regions.

The economy contracted by 5.3% in 2020, the first annual fall since the 5.6% contraction in the wake of the global financial crisis. This was a less severe downturn than in the other major economies in western Europe; real GDP fell by 8.3% in France, 9.9% in the UK and 11% in Spain. Germany's better outturn reflects less stringent lockdowns, high levels of government support and a large manufacturing sector-equivalent to 20% of gross value added, and closely tied to the strongly recovering Chinese market-which was able to continue operating with social-distancing measures in place.
We expect real GDP to return to 98.2% of its 2019 size in 2021, a quicker recovery than the west European average, with annual growth of 3.7% in 2021 and 4% in 2022. The latter reflects strong carryover effects and improving macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets. The industrial sector has been hit less severely by the second lockdown and Germany's export-oriented manufacturing firms are benefiting from growing demand in China and other Asian markets. China overtook France as Germany's second-largest export destination in 2020, and our forecast of 8.5% GDP growth in China in 2021 will keep demand for German exports elevated. Construction was a bright spot in 2020, expanding as housebuilding continued. Consumers will maintain high precautionary savings this year, but much of the forced savings resulting from lockdowns and deferred investment will be drawn down to satisfy pent-up demand in the second quarter, once restrictions are lifted. The Kurzarbeit scheme has been extended to end-2021, which will support disposable incomes. However, in-person services will take longer to recover, and the immediate outlook is not promising. After a decrease in 2020, owing to deferred reporting obligations and massive government financial support, we expect a rise in bankruptcies this year.
We forecast 1.9% annual average growth in 2023-25. The poor demographic outlook will constrain potential growth as the working-age population declines, exacerbated by a fall in net immigration during the pandemic. Technological disruption to the automotive sector also represents a structural risk: Germany has been slow to shift emphasis towards electric vehicles. Efforts to reduce supply-chain dependence on China may see some reshoring of production, but as labour costs in Europe are higher, we do not expect this to bring a surge in job creation. Instead, automation and digitisation will gain pace, and linkages with existing suppliers in central and eastern Europe will strengthen.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends Services account for about 70% of GDP, industry for almost 30% and agriculture less than 1%. The share of industry in the German economy exceeds those of all the other major economies in Europe, with the UK and France both below 20% and even Italy barely at 24%. This proved an advantage for Germany during the pandemic in 2020-21, as industrial production was less disrupted by social-distancing restrictions than contact-intensive services. Nonetheless, we expect a gradual reduction in the share of industry in the economy, to 28% in 2025. A decrease in the relative importance of manufacturing is the inevitable result of rising living standards: as people become wealthier, they spend a higher proportion of their income on services. However, it also reflects the changing nature of industry: Germany's industrial champions increasingly provide value added through services supplied in conjunction with manufactured products.
The automotive sector is currently managing a structural transition Germany's most important manufacturing sectors are automotive, electrical and mechanical engineering, chemicals, and food, drink and tobacco. Germany is the global leader in the production of premium cars, an industry that has benefited from robust competition between several domestic companies, ownership structures that have enabled firms to make long-term investments, and a host of innovative supplier companies in the mechanical and electrical engineering sectors. Germany's automotive sector is currently managing a structural transition towards electric and hybrid vehicles, having historically invested heavily in diesel technology and entered the electric market comparatively late. As major producers of capital goods, German firms were able to weather the years following the global financial crisis by profiting from rapid industrialisation in emerging markets such as China and India. China became Germany's second-largest export market in 2020; it is now also a rapidly growing competitor in the high-tech industrial sector.
Most industries derive competitive advantages from Germany's well-developed system of vocational training, good physical infrastructure and research base, and a tax system that encourages capital investment. Low interest rates and fiscal stimulus measures targeted towards infrastructure improvements and the green and digital transitions will continue to support construction, which is currently facing capacity constraints in the face of accelerating demand. Although we do not expect the EUR750bn Next Generation EU recovery fund to directly spur much infrastructure spending in Germany itself, sharp rises in other member states will result in spillover benefits for German companies.
The pandemic has had an asymmetric impact on the services sector The services sector is the largest component of GDP and comprises a broad range of activities, from retailing to financial services, logistics and healthcare. The pandemic has had a highly asymmetric impact on the services sector, with contact-intensive services such as retail, accommodation and foodservice heavily affected, while professional services that can be performed remotely have held up well. We expect this split to remain substantial even as the economy recovers, with many of the changes prompted by the pandemic-more remote working, less business travel, a rise in e-commerce at the expense of bricks-and-mortar retailers-enduring throughout our forecast period.
The financial services sector entered this crisis in a comparatively strong position, with high capital-adequacy ratios and low levels of non-performing loans. We expect the share of bad loans to rise now that a temporary moratorium on insolvencies has come to an end, while the phasing out of the Kurzarbeit scheme by end-2021 presents a further risk. Profitability-which was already low, amid a low-interest-rate environment-is likely to fall further, and market regulation-in the wake of the Wirecard accounting scandal-is likely to be strengthened. More positively, Germany's main financial hub, Frankfurt, has seen a modest rise in the number of registered companies as a result of Brexit.

Consumer prices rose by just 0.4% in 2020, reflecting low oil prices, the hit to demand from the coronavirus and the cut to the VAT rate in July-December. January 2021 saw a change in trend, with annual inflation rising to 1.6% as a consequence of the end of the VAT cut, new carbon emissions certificates raising transport and heating costs, and a minimum-wage rise. Annual price growth will remain slightly above the euro zone average in 2021 as a consequence of these changes in administered prices. We expect inflation to average 1.8% in 2021, before moderating to an average of 1.6% in 2022-25, allowing for a continuation of the ECB's accommodative monetary policy.

The euro experienced high volatility throughout 2020. A depreciation against the US dollar in the early months of the year, when the coronavirus forced European countries into lockdowns, was followed by a rapid appreciation after the EU announced the establishment of a new recovery fund worth EUR750bn. We forecast that the euro will stabilise at an average of US$1.21:EUR1 in 2021, supported by the weakness of the US dollar. In 2022-23 we expect depreciation against the dollar, owing to a protracted economic recovery, muted inflation and continued monetary accommodation from the ECB, which will maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy stance for longer than the Federal Reserve (the US central bank). The euro will strengthen from 2024 onwards, supported by the euro zone's structural current-account surplus and by the gradual unwinding of the ECB's asset purchases.

Germany's current-account surpluses were the largest in the world in nominal terms in the four years to 2019, and we expect them to be so again from 2021, after temporarily falling below China last year. They are underpinned by huge trade surpluses, reflecting the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector. This will continue to generate large domestic savings that are mainly invested abroad, leading to a solid primary income surplus.
We expect the 2020 recession to have caused a decline in Germany's trade surplus, as the fall in exports outstripped the fall in imports. We estimate the current-account surplus at the equivalent of 6.8% of GDP-down from an annual average of 7.8% in the previous six years. Trade and primary income surpluses will comfortably outweigh narrow structural deficits on the services and secondary income accounts throughout our forecast period. We expect the current-account surplus to recover in nominal terms in 2021. In 2022-25 we forecast that the external surplus will average 6.9% of GDP as world trade volumes and investment flows recover.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Germany Stocks and flows Germany is an attractive destination for foreign investment, but the country's role as an exporter of long-term capital is more important: it is the fourth-largest investor in the world. The skills of its workforce, the availability of supplier companies, the quality of the research and innovation framework, and a reliable administrative and legal environment make Germany one of the most attractive global destinations for inward foreign direct investment (FDI). However, relative to GDP, the stock of such investment is lower than in some other comparatively sized economies. Following a significant increase in inflows during the 1990s, the rate of growth of FDI then slowed, falling below the world average, and outflows have exceeded inflows since 2004. In 2017 and 2018 FDI inflows accelerated, but in 2019 (latest available data), as economic growth slowed, they more than halved to EUR72bn (in line with similar volatility elsewhere in Europe). In 2019 the inward FDI stock came to EUR1.8trn, equivalent to 46.7% of GDP; the outward FDI stock stood at 65.6% of GDP.
Origin and distribution As is the case in other developed countries, the FDI stock in Germany is increasingly dominated by service providers rather than by manufacturers, although manufacturers remain important, in line with the relatively large size of the manufacturing sector. About two-thirds of Germany's inward FDI stock originates from other EU member states-although this sometimes includes investment from outside the EU that is transferred through countries such as the Netherlands and Luxembourg, often for tax reasons. The most important investor from outside the EU is the US, which accounts for 12% of the total stock. Authorities and companies have become increasingly hesitant about increasing investment from China (which amounts to just over 1% of the FDI stock), which often targets mid-sized companies with significant technological know-how. This is likely to weigh on investment from China in the coming years, as Germany has put its weight behind new investment screening measures at the EU level. Most outward investment is to other EU countries, but investment in Switzerland, the US, Russia and China is also significant.
Determinants Germany's attractiveness as an investment location stems from its robust institutional framework, stable legal code, strong research and innovation capacity, and an extensive network of global and regional supply chains. The country also has good infrastructure, a number of innovative high-tech clusters and a high-quality workforce. Labour costs are among the highest in the world, but compare strongly with European peers owing to a lengthy period of wage restraint. Germany Trade and Invest is the first point of contact for foreign investors, and provides pandemic-specific information including details about growing areas of demand such as digital solutions for health, education and logistics. Foreign investors, including private equity firms, are attracted by the large number of profitable medium-sized companies specialising in niche markets. Regulations such as the right of worker representatives to sit on company boards (up to half of board members) have deterred some foreign investors, but in practice the system of workforce representation in companies often helps company management bodies to communicate their strategies and, where necessary, explain the need for changes in working practice-or even reduced pay in difficult circumstances. The tax environment remains, on balance, a downside.
Impact Foreign-owned companies employ about 2.5m people in Germany. Many FDI inflows take the form of acquisitions rather than greenfield investment, and hence the immediate impact on employment is not clear (and in some cases is initially negative). In industry, especially manufacturing, the dominance of German firms means that FDI has had only a limited impact. Foreign investment in Germany's services has had a larger impact on the domestic economy, boosting productivity via the introduction of new technology and fewer hierarchical organisational structures. Investment by private equity groups has also helped to inject capital and managerial expertise into slow-growing family-owned businesses.
Potential Germany's skilled workforce and sound infrastructure make it a good location for specialised manufacturing. More generally, the structure of German industry is still relatively fragmented, providing foreign investors with the opportunity to participate in sectoral consolidation and to reap economies of scale through acquisitions. The generational changeover at the helm of several small and medium-sized companies provides opportunities for foreign investors, although in many cases foreign involvement is not appreciated. The still-moderate level of property prices-by west European standards-and increasing demand for housing, especially in urban areas, may attract investors into this sector. A poor demographic outlook, with population growth set to stagnate and then decline, will constrain Germany's potential as a consumer market. Government screening of inward investment has increased recently and will remain high, as political pressure to protect sensitive industries has increased in recent years and has broadened from traditional strategic industries, such as defence, to high-tech industries, driven by the desire not to sell technology to future competitors, and the healthcare sector. This is the case across Europe, and has led to delays in approving projects and more frequent rejections of takeovers.

As a consequence of the pandemic, there was negative population growth in 2020 Germany's population declined between 2002 and 2011, but high levels of net immigration underpinned population growth thereafter. The population reached 82.8m in 2018 and has stabilised at about this level, up from about 80.3m in 2011, boosted in particular by the impact of the migrant crisis in 2015. The pandemic in 2020 resulted in a higher death rate, lower net immigration and slightly fewer births than in 2019, meaning that there was no population growth for the first time in nine years. The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that the population will increase marginally in 2021-22 as the impact of the pandemic recedes, before beginning a longer-term trend of decline.
The population has recorded a natural decline in every year since 1972, with the death rate higher than the birth rate, and this will continue to be the case in 2021-25. The birth rate plummeted after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, especially in East Germany, but more recently this trend has reversed, with the fertility rate rising to 1.6 children per woman in 2020-the highest figure since the 1970s. This reflects both policy efforts, such as an expansion in childcare provision and parental benefits, and a higher fertility rate among immigrant communities. However, this is still well below the replacement rate of 2.1, the rate needed to keep the population size constant in the absence of migration.
Population growth will depend on net immigration, given no natural growth Population growth since 1972 has come entirely from positive net immigration. This peaked in 2015 during the migrant crisis, when migrants and refugees from conflict zones in the Middle East and North Africa were attracted to Germany in particular because of its strong economy and initially welcoming policy stance. However, the sheer volume of arrivals soon proved politically unsustainable, prompting a hardening of the government's position. The influx of migrants slowed in 2016-17, reflecting the closing of the Balkan route into the EU and an agreement (brokered by Germany) between the EU and Turkey to halt migrants crossing illegally to the bloc from Turkey. In early 2020 Turkey decided to end this agreement and opened its borders with Greece, leading to another inflow of refugees attempting to enter the EU. In the absence of a common migration policy, EU member states decided not to allow the asylum-seekers to enter the bloc. Governments across Europe have shifted to the right on migration policy; in Germany, the government is under pressure from the inflammatory rhetoric of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). We believe that the country is unlikely to open its borders again.
The working-age population remains fairly large, but is declining swiftly This means that the demographic outlook will remain poor. As in the region more broadly, the population is ageing, with the old-age dependency ratio expected to rise throughout the forecast period and the working-age population already in decline. We expect the share of the population aged 15-64 to fall throughout the forecast period, from 53.6% in 2020 to 51.7% in 2025. The size of the working-age population in Germany remains significantly larger than in regional peers such as France (40.2%) or Italy (35.6%), but the rate of decline is faster. This is likely to lead to greater pressure on the pensions and healthcare systems. It will also exacerbate labour shortages, given robust economic activity at present in Germany and a tight labour market-even amid the pandemic, the unemployment rate is barely over 4%. Efforts have already been made to attract more women and older workers into employment, but there will be diminishing returns from these over the forecast period, and data from 2020 suggest that the policy response to the pandemic (including school closures) has damaged the female labour force participation rate. Policy innovation will also be needed to attract immigrants into the labour market.
Germany has the second-highest number of immigrants in the world, after the US, with more than 16m first- and second-generation immigrants. The largest groups in 2019 were from Turkey (which is double the size of any other group), Poland, Syria, Romania and Italy. Aside from a large inflow of migrants from the Middle East and the Balkans in 2015-16, the turnaround in net immigration since 2011 reflects a rise in the number of people migrating to Germany from Poland, Romania and Bulgaria, and to a lesser extent from crisis-hit members of the euro zone, such as Italy and Greece. Germany has largely been successful at integrating the migrant labour force.

Germany will remain the fourth-largest economy in the world in 2025 Measured by GDP at current exchange rates, Germany is the fourth-largest economy in the world, behind the US, China and Japan. According to The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecasts, this will still be the case in 2025, with German GDP at about US$4.9trn, although this figure is lower than it would have been without the hit from the pandemic (China was the only one of these economies to grow in 2020). Germany is the largest economy in Europe, about 40% larger than the French economy, the second-biggest; and accounts for just over one-fifth of total EU GDP. On a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis, which adjusts for differences in price levels between countries that are not always captured by market exchange rates, the German economy is the fifth-largest in the world, behind China, the US, India and Japan.

Germany is the largest consumer market in the EU in terms of population size. However, GDP per head is only the eighth-highest in the EU, and the market for consumer goods is further reduced by an elevated savings rate, a cultural reluctance to buy on credit, the second-highest tax wedge as a percentage of labour costs in the OECD (after Belgium), and a low proportion of national income accounted for by wages and salaries.
The pandemic caused major disruption to retail and supported e-commerce The coronavirus pandemic caused major disruption to parts of the German retail sector, with lockdowns and social-distancing measures resulting in lower footfall, changed working patterns and huge shifts in the composition of household spending. On an aggregate basis, the retail sector was resilient in 2020, with sales volumes expanding by 3.6%, according to data from the Bundesbank (the central bank). However, this masked a sharp divergence in sales patterns: although online purchases surged alongside firm demand for groceries, household goods and electricals, there were significantly weaker sales at clothing and department stores, foodservice outlets and some other non-essential retail segments.
Online retail sales totalled an estimated EUR71.5bn in 2020, equivalent to about 12.5% of all retail sales, according to the German Retail Federation (HDE). This was up from EUR59.2bn (10.8%) in 2019, with a strong expansion in online purchases of "everyday goods" offsetting the weakness of clothing sales. We expect many of these habits to persist after the pandemic-related restrictions have been rolled back. The traditional mainstays of bricks-and-mortar retail such as bookshops, consumer electronics stores and household appliance chains will thus continue to disappear, while department stores struggle to remain profitable. Reflecting the high market share of discounters, consumers will retain a strong price focus for staple goods, including food and clothing, but high-end income gains will also sustain demand for luxury goods.
The Kurzarbeit wage-subsidy scheme and other government stimulus measures supported continued wage growth in 2020, although a combination of forced and precautionary savings bumped up the savings rate from 11.2% in 2019 to 17.1%, thereby limiting consumer spending. Collective-bargaining arrangements foresee firm wage growth in the medium term, and we forecast a comparatively rapid recovery from the crisis in Germany (versus regional peers). We expect personal disposable incomes to return to robust growth from 2022, with pent-up demand resulting in a period of strong post-crisis consumer spending.
Population ageing will influence longer-term spending patterns Germany is a mature consumer market, but demographic and social trends will have an important influence on spending patterns over the next few years. The continued rise in the number of single and two-person households, which now comprise three-quarters of the total, will support sales of white goods. The population is ageing, and, according to Germany Trade and Invest, people older than 50 years now account for more than half of purchasing power. This brings with it a rising demand for age-related services, particularly in the health sector, and for products-for example, in the tourism industry-that cater specifically for the needs of the elderly. Meanwhile, the increasing awareness in the working-age population that the public pension system will not remain as generous as it is at present will boost demand for retirement savings products in the financial services industry.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Initial conditions: Germany has many attributes that are conducive to sustainable long-term growth, including a highly skilled workforce, good infrastructure and stable institutions. Its economic underperformance prior to the 2008-09 global financial crisis was largely the result of deficient consumer demand, but also reflected supply-side rigidities in services. The situation in the labour market and wage dynamics indicate that the rebalancing towards consumption-driven growth has scope to continue throughout a multi-year time horizon. The structural shift towards a more services-oriented economy still has further to go in Germany than in other OECD members, owing to the relatively high share of the manufacturing industry in overall GDP. Growth in services is likely to come from areas connected with the manufacturing sector.
The demographic outlook will prove the biggest drag on long-term growth Demographic trends: The Economist Intelligence Unit expects negative demographic trends in the coming decades, with the total population set to shrink by 0.14% per year on average in 2021-50 (the long-term forecast period), and the working-age population set to decline at an even more rapid rate of 0.59% per year. The tightening of conditions for long-term unemployment benefits has increased the incentive to search for employment, and additional measures in the same direction are likely in the long term. The partial reversal of previous plans to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 between 2012 and 2029 will add to demographic challenges, although we expect some relief to come from increased participation of older workers. Immigration from central and eastern Europe could make a modest contribution to alleviating labour shortages, and further liberalisation of immigration rules for highly skilled workers from non-EU countries is possible. The large-scale immigration from the Middle East and Africa seen in 2015 provided a temporary boost for the demographic outlook, but the arrival of another wave of refugees in early 2020 at the borders of Europe was met with a firm rebuff. The economic fallout of climate change may drive more refugees to Europe from Africa in the coming decades, but political considerations will prevent large-scale arrivals from being accepted in Germany.
External conditions: As an export-oriented country, Germany benefits from the broadly liberal world trade order. Generally, it suffers less than other developed countries (for example, Italy) from competition from emerging markets, such as China and India, owing to its specialisation in high-technology capital goods. This specialisation will also allow Germany to benefit from strong demand from these countries as they upgrade their capital stock. However, over the longer term German output will come under more pressure as manufacturers in emerging markets become more sophisticated and challenge German producers head on in high-end merchandise goods. Within the EU the liberalisation of trade in services should continue, albeit slowly. Germany (in line with the EU more broadly) will aim to balance its trade ties with China and its diplomatic and security ties with the US, despite ongoing US-China trade tensions; and will push to maintain the multilateral trading system by reforming the World Trade Organisation. The open German economy would be exposed to a further acceleration of trade protectionism.
Institutions and policy trends: Germany's low growth in the early 2000s focused the minds of politicians and policymakers on the need for economic reforms, many of which were implemented, along with more flexible bargaining about wages and other working conditions. Our expectation is that national and EU initiatives will continue to strengthen competition, but there is a risk that the recent loss of faith in market-based solutions will persist. Under the previous government, there were already signs of a partial reversal of the reforms that have underpinned strong growth in recent years. Although the public finances are currently in a healthy state, and the sharp rise in public debt arising from the pandemic will be manageable, further reform is needed to make them sustainable in the long term. Not much movement in this direction, for instance via the reform of the pension system, is currently in sight, and we expect policymaking to continue to be slow.
Long-term performance: Our forecast for the economy's long-term average annual growth rate is 1.5%, slowing from 2% in 2021-30 to 1.3% in 2031-50. A contraction of the working-age population is the main driver of this weakening overall growth rate; total factor productivity will remain supportive of growth, as will capital spending. The picture looks slightly more favourable on a per-head basis, with growth of real GDP per head averaging 1.7% in our long-term forecast period, slightly faster than average growth since reunification in 1990. GDP per head in 2050 will therefore come to US$141,540, marginally behind the UK, but still well ahead of France. In terms of the size of the German economy overall, we expect it to be overtaken by India in the 2030s, in line with a broader eastward shift in economic power, making it the world's fifth-largest economy at market exchange rates in the world by 2050.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability The Energiewende, which focuses on expanding renewable energy and reducing Germany's carbon footprint, has been a critical element of the country's energy policy for the past decade. In 2020 renewable energy accounted for 46% of the country's power supply. Coal use is declining, with its phase-out to be completed by 2038, but still accounts for about 30% of the power supply; the nuclear phase-out will be completed by end-2022. Germany aims to cut emissions by at least 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. Among the flagship measures announced in 2019 to reduce carbon emissions is a carbon tax levied on transport and buildings, from 2021. Incentives to buy electric cars, lower value-added tax (VAT) on rail travel, surcharges on domestic flights and higher road tolls for lorries aim to accomplish the same goal. On the supply side, Germany aims to become a global leader in green hydrogen (produced solely with renewable energies), with an ambitious national hydrogen strategy announced in 2020.
Recent studies conducted by the Ministry of the Environment conclude that on the current measures, by the end of the decade emissions will have been reduced by 51% from 1990s levels, instead of the planned 55%. The government will therefore ramp up efforts to reduce emissions in the coming years-not least as the coalition in office following the federal election in September 2021 is likely to include The Greens.
Public support for emissions reduction is substantial. Nonetheless, frictions are likely to emerge. Closing coal-fired power stations will have a disproportionate impact on parts of east Germany where jobs are scarce and support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which denies human responsibility for climate change, is well established. The need to ensure adequate gas supplies also underpins Germany's support for the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline-running from Russia to Europe across the Baltic Sea-which is opposed by the US and by several countries in eastern Europe (notably Poland and Ukraine), but for now is still set to be completed in 2021.
Germany's exposure to the impact of climate change will remain comparatively low, given its geographical position, with limited coastal areas and a temperate climate. We expect the government to remain willing to provide the infrastructure upgrades necessary in the face of more extreme weather patterns in the future, although in the short term construction firms will struggle with capacity constraints. Supply-chain risk may increase as countries on which the export-oriented German economy depends are damaged by climate change. Our long-term growth model, which explicitly incorporates the impact of climate change, shows that the German economy will be 1% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth.
Technological developments Technological advancements will have a significant effect on Germany over the long term for a number of reasons. First, the share of manufacturing in GDP is much higher there than in most other developed European countries, with industry accounting for almost 30% of the economy. According to the OECD, along with agriculture, manufacturing is the sector most exposed to automation globally. In general, the OECD found that jobs in Germany (as in central and eastern Europe, and Japan) were easier to automate than those in the UK, the US, Nordic countries and the Netherlands.
Second, Germany is typically strong at research and development (R&D), and innovation, which could make a transition to higher automation rates both more likely and quicker. In 2019 Germany spent 3.2% of GDP on R&D, among the highest rates in the bloc (the EU average was 2.2%), but slightly behind Sweden and Austria. Germany also filed 15% of all patents at the European Patent Office, the second-highest share in the world, after the US with 25%.
Third, Germany is already starting from a strong position. In 2019 it was ranked by the International Federation of Robotics as the fourth most highly automated country in the world, after Singapore, South Korea and Japan. Robot density stood at 346 robots per 10,000 workers, and Germany accounted for 38% of all industrial robots in Europe.
Germany is already working to increase automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies as part of its Industry 4.0 strategy, and efforts to embed new technologies across the industrial sector will continue over the long term. This is likely to be disruptive for the automotive sector in particular, as e-mobility gains pace and autonomous vehicles are further developed, and as diesel technologies are gradually phased out. It is also likely to prove difficult for the Mittelstand, the often family-owned small and medium-sized enterprises found across the country that are central to Germany's manufacturing prowess, as they may struggle to acquire the digital skills needed to compete with new challengers. Efforts to make these firms more resilient to digital disruption will gain pace in 2020-50. Although the country will not supplant the US as a leader in innovation, adoption of new technology will be consistently strong.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2016-20) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2021-25). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2016-20. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2021-25 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2016-20 ranges are then used to derive 2021-25 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2021-25, not to the likely situation in 2025 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2018 or 2023). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - The centre-right New Democracy (ND) administration led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis is the first single-party government since the start of the Greek sovereign debt crisis more than a decade ago. This should allow for a more stable and effective government than its predecessor, a coalition led by the left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left-Progressive Alliance (Syriza). Neverthe-less, the multiple challenges facing the country, especially amid the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, suggest that political instability risk will remain high in 2021-25 (the forecast period). The ND government will struggle to implement measures to address major shortcomings in the public administration. Historical tensions between Greece and Turkey have intensified. The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that both sides will aim to prevent tensions from escalating into military hostility, but the risk of conflict has greatly increased.

- Greece's business environment score rises from 5.63 in the historical period (2016-20) to 6.70 in the forecast period (2021-25), pushing up its global ranking by thirteen places, to 42nd. However, Greece remains one place from the bottom of the regional ranking, at 17th, above only Turkey. In addition, because of Greece's heavy reliance on tourism, the economy was especially hard hit by the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, despite the government's relatively good handling of the crisis, the negative effects of which will carry over into 2021.

- The ND government made a good start to implementing its economic reform agenda and meeting Greece's commitments to its international creditors, but severe policy constraints will remain in place in 2021-25 and beyond, until the huge government debt is substantially reduced. General government debt was an estimated 209% of GDP at end 2020, mainly owed to official creditors (the EU and the IMF), making another debt write-down-as happened in 2012-unlikely. In the short term the coronavirus poses a significant downside risk to growth, given the likely negative impact on tourism. We forecast a gradual pick-up in activity, to real GDP growth of 3.2% this year, 5.7% in 2022 and an average of 3.2% per year in 2023-25, reflecting in part our expectation that the EU recovery fund will lift output as government support measures for households and businesses are gradually withdrawn. Greece's exit from the euro is not a short- or medium-term risk.

Population growth   -0.4 -0.5
Working-age population growth   -0.8 -0.7

- According to UN projections, the population will decline slowly in the coming five years, by an average of 0.5% per year in 2021-25. However, life expectancy is increasing, and in 2020 it was estimated to average 81.6 years-broadly in line with the EU27 average of 81.3 (2019). The population structure by age already bears all the hallmarks of the demographic ageing process, with the decline in the working-age population and rise in the elderly population (65 years and older) projected to continue. The proportion of people aged over 65 is forecast to rise from an estimated 22.4% in 2020 to 24% in 2025. Population ageing will prove to be a burden on already heavily indebted social services, particularly the pension and healthcare systems.

- During the pandemic GDP per head (at market exchange rates) slumped to an estimated US$18,116 in 2020-well below the EU average. This is forecast to rise to US$24,828 by 2025. This primarily reflects a projected recovery in GDP, from a low base, following the coronavirus crisis, but also a shrinking population. The after-effects of the coronavirus crisis in 2020-21 will continue to reshape market opportunities, which had already changed considerably during the sovereign debt crisis. The recovery of the tourism industry (and associated real estate) sector, should revive market opportunities. A return to the rapid pre-crisis increases in one-person households is unlikely over the medium term.

Growth of real GDP per head 3.0 1.5 2.0

Labour productivity growth 2.5 2.3 2.4
From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.

- We expect real GDP to grow at 2.5% per year on average in 2021-30 (3% per head). Over 2031-50 average annual GDP growth is forecast to be 1% (1.5% per head). Labour productivity growth is expected to average 2.4% per year over the entire long-term forecast period. We expect a decline in the working-age population and the labour force in 2021-50. We believe that there remains a risk that Greece will leave the euro area over the long term.

Background: After 400 years of Ottoman rule Greece emerged as a sovereign state in 1830. A devastating civil war followed the retreat of German occupying forces in 1944. A military junta ruled the country from 1967 to 1974, but since then a democracy has been in place. In 1981 Greece joined the European Economic Community, now the EU. It became a member of the economic and monetary union (EMU) in 2001, but its public finances became unsustainable, resulting in a sovereign debt crisis in 2009-10. Greece's elevated public debt has put its continued membership of EMU into question.
Political structure: Greece is a parliamentary republic, with deputies elected for four-year terms. The prime minister and government hold executive powers. The president is elected by the 300-member parliament for a five-year term. The government requires the support of parliament to hold office. The 2010 crisis shook the traditional party system. Voters blamed the parties that ruled Greece after the return of democracy in the mid-1970s-New Democracy (ND) and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok)-for causing the crisis, which led to the imposition of painful austerity by the country's external creditors. The result has been political fragmentation and the rise of populist parties such as the left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left-Progressive Alliance (Syriza), which came to power in 2015, and far-right parties such as the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (XA), but ND returned to power in July 2019 and XA failed to win enough votes to enter parliament.
Policy issues: Greece exited its third economic adjustment programme in August 2018, but it is still subject to an enhanced surveillance monitoring regime by its euro zone creditors. The coronavirus-related public health crisis has put agreed fiscal targets and some structural reforms temporarily in abeyance. In the short term the government's main focus will be to control a renewed rise in coronavirus cases and mitigate the economic impact of a second national lockdown. In the medium to long term, the main challenges will be putting Greece's public finances on a sustainable footing, diversifying economic activity to reduce overdependence on tourism, improving the business environment, reviving the privatisation programme, eliminating state arrears to the private sector and reducing Greek banks' high levels of non-performing loans.
Taxation: Changes in the 2020 budget included a corporate tax rate of 24% (28% previously) and 5% on distributed dividends (10% previously). The top personal income tax rate is 44% on annual earnings over EUR40,000. The standard value-added tax (VAT) rate is 24%.
Foreign trade: In 2019 goods exports (fob) were worth about US$36.3bn and imports (fob) amounted to US$61.9bn. The current account registered a deficit of US$3.1bn, equivalent to 1.5% of GDP.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Following the July 2019 general election, the centre-right New Democracy (ND) party, led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, was returned to office with a majority of 158 seats in the 300-seat parliament. The ND government replaced a coalition comprising the dominant left-wing Syriza Coalition of the Radical Left-Progressive Alliance (Syriza), led by Alexis Tsipras, and the smaller, hardline nationalist Independent Greeks (AE). Several parties represented in the previous parliament either did not stand, notably the centre-left To Potami (The River), or failed to reach the 3% vote threshold for parliamentary representation, such as AE and the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (XA). In October 2020, after a trial that had lasted five and a half years, an Athens court sentenced 57 leaders, members and associates of XA to a total of more than 500 years in prison on charges ranging from murder and assault to running or participating in a criminal organisation.

Political outlook: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the ND administration led by Mr Mitsotakis to provide stable and effective government during the forecast period. It is the first single-party executive since the start of the Greek crisis a decade ago and has 158 seats in the 300-seat parliament. The ND government's strong record has helped to strengthen investor sentiment towards Greece and boost public support, but the challenges ahead are formidable, especially since the outbreak of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. If the already high unemployment rate rises sharply, as we expect, renewed social unrest is possible.
The spread of the coronavirus to Greece in early 2020 posed new challenges for the government: to contain contagion, and to mitigate the economic and social impact. The government performed well in the first wave and Greece recorded relatively few cases and related deaths, despite a decade of austerity during which healthcare spending had declined sharply as a share of GDP. However, since the reopening of the economy began in June, the number of cases and related deaths has risen sharply.
On a 14-day cumulative measure published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of new cases per 100,000 people peaked at 331.6 on November 21st, compared with a peak during the first wave of just 10.7 per 100,000 on April 4th. ECDC data showed a subsequent decline through to late January 2021, when the case rate began rising again, almost doubling in the space of one month to an average of 147.9 in the third week of February. The government came under pressure to consider a further tightening of restrictions rather than an easing, amid delays in the vaccination programme owing to supply shortages. The cumulative number of coronavirus-related deaths reached 6,534 on March 2nd 2021, up from just 179 on June 2nd 2020. We expect that tighter restrictions in the final quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 will have depressed economic activity, reversing a partial recovery in July-September 2020.
Tackling the fallout from the coronavirus crisis has consumed most of the government's energy and resources this year, slowing the reform process. However, we expect that EU grants and loans to Greece from the EU recovery fund will revive reform momentum and boost employment and investment. A comprehensive draft reform plan focused on green and digital transformation, and measures to increase employment, social cohesion and private investment was submitted to the European Commission on November 18th 2020. The Commission is expected to make its final assessment of the plan in April 2021. Given political and societal resistance to reforms, implementation is likely to be challenging.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Greece scores poorly in relation to other developed economies on political and institutional effectiveness, as a result of the high levels of corruption, patronage and inefficiency affecting the government and the legal system. Under the terms of Greece's financial assistance package, which expired in August 2018, the authorities committed to implementing a far-reaching reform of the public administration, judiciary and society more broadly. However, political effectiveness has been sorely lacking since the start of the bail-out era in 2010, reflecting weak governments and an inefficient bureaucracy. Despite a range of fiscal and structural reforms having been legislated, implementation of bail-out and post-bail out policies has fallen short in the face of political and societal resistance. The ND government has provided some momentum to the reform process, enacting several reforms intended to improve government effectiveness, including one containing measures to address major short-comings in public administration. However, the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020 has disrupted the reform process in many areas, causing delays to the adoption of agreed legislation, as well as the implementation of reforms. In addition, resistance from political groups and trade unions to change in the civil service is typically strong.
The coronavirus pandemic has delayed implementation of some reforms The establishment of a modern state and public administration has been one of the four pillars of the reform agenda under the bail-out programme and the post-bail-out enhanced surveillance regime overseen by Greece's euro zone creditors. The main priorities have been to control the size and cost of the public sector and at the same time increase the efficiency of the public administration in the delivery of essential public goods and services. Reforms have been designed aimed at strengthening the institutional and operational independence of major institutions, such as revenue administration and the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT, the national statistics office), as well as improving the efficiency of the judicial system and tackling corruption.
Action to strengthen the public sector recruitment system is continuing During most of the 2010-18 period the government adhered to an attrition rule of one new entry for every three exits; this was adjusted to 1:1 in 2019-22, with unfilled positions from the previous period carried over into 2020, in addition to allowing the conversion of temporary posts into permanent positions. However, in order to increase its control over the hiring of temporary staff, the ND government has reduced the number of exceptions used to bypass temporary staff hiring procedures. At the same time, the government is taking action to strengthen the efficiency of the civil service recruitment system and reduce political interference, by increasing the capacity of the Supreme Council for Civil Personnel Selection (ASEP), the authority responsible for civil service recruitment, by end-2022. The measures include stronger competition procedures, scoring classification procedures, temporary staff hiring procedures and the reorganisation of the Council. However, given past trends and a likely surge in unemployment as a result of the pandemic when government support measures are gradually withdrawn, a return in the future to pre-crisis practices of excessive levels of public-sector hiring and political interference cannot be ruled out.
The European Commission's quarterly enhanced surveillance reviews have highlighted that there has been uneven progress in areas such as depoliticisation of the public administration. This was supposed to be accomplished through renewal of the top management and the implemen-tation of new selection procedures for all levels of senior management, including the replacement of political appointees. The Commission has also noted mixed progress in efforts to increase the efficiency of the judicial system, which is needed to enhance the business environment and revive investment. Greece's judicial system remains burdened by an excessive backlog of cases, especially tax cases (appealing tax decisions can take up to 12 years). The sector is subject to frequent strikes by the courts and the Bar Association.
In terms of the anti-corruption agenda, the implementation of the relevant action plan is proceeding, but the government has yet to address fully concerns expressed about legislative amendments adopted in June 2019 that down-graded the status of active bribery from felony to misdemeanour. The authorities have repeatedly amended the legal framework for the financing of political parties to bring it into line with European best practice.
Overall, progress in modernising the public administration and tackling ingrained patronage and corruption has been slow. We expect some further improvement in these areas during the forecast period, as reflected in the improved score from 4.9 to 6.1 in the political effectiveness category of the business environment rankings. We expect Greece to continue to lag behind most of its peers in the EU in this area. However, the need to improve government effectiveness to meet the governance requirements for access to EU recovery funds could spur a more rapid improvement than we are currently expecting.
Political outlook: Election watch The next general election is due in mid-2023, when Greece will also hold local and regional polls. We expect the ND government to remain in office until the end of the four-year parliamentary term. In January 2020 parliament passed a law that restored the 50-seat bonus for the party that wins the most votes in a general election, which had been abolished by the previous administration. However, with 163 votes in favour, the restoration of the 50-seat bonus will take effect only at the general election after the next one, which is likely to complicate government formation after the 2023 general election. In January 2020 the ND candidate, Katerina Sakellaropoulou (a senior judge), was elected as president by an overwhelming majority in the first round of voting, with the support of the two main opposition parties. The next presidential election is not due until January 2025.
Political outlook: International relations Persistent domestic political and economic instability has limited Greece's influence in the EU. However, the Mitsotakis government has begun to repair the damage and has made good progress in strengthening relations with the US. Tensions between Greece and Turkey are endemic, but have intensified, notably over long-standing territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea and hydrocarbons exploration in the eastern Mediterranean. As a result, the risk of conflict has increased. However, we believe that both sides will prevent tensions from escalating into military hostilities. The refugee crisis in Turkey (stemming from the conflict in Syria) has stoked Turkey-EU tensions, leaving Greece exposed to a new wave of migrants seeking to enter the EU.

Economic reforms introduced since the height of the Greek fiscal crisis in 2010, and the election in July 2019 of a pro-business, centre-right government, have improved the outlook for the business environment in Greece. Owing to progress in several categories, The Economist Intelligence Unit's overall business environment score for Greece rises from 5.63 in the historical period (2016-20) to 6.70 in the forecast period (2021-25), pushing up its global ranking by 13 places, to 42nd. However, Greece remains one place from the bottom of the regional ranking, at 17th, above only Turkey. In addition, because of Greece's heavy reliance on tourism, the economy was especially hard hit by the 2020 coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, despite the government's relatively good handling of the crisis, the negative effects of which will carry over into 2021.
Public administration reforms could make a big difference to business The biggest improvements are in government effectiveness, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, and financing. These improvements reflect the potential impact of the overhaul of the public administration introduced by the New Democracy (ND) government in 2019 and a further bout of digitisation, expedited as the government leveraged public health needs to curb union and bureaucratic resistance; and a swift realignment from support- to recovery-related pandemic-driven funding; reforms in the banking system to reduce Greek banks' still high level of non-performing loans; and efforts to attract foreign investment in the transport and logistics sectors.
The economy remains under an enhanced surveillance regime, but Greece's creditors have adopted a more positive attitude towards the country's economic prospects. This reflects the ND government's strong start to its pro-business legislative agenda and its handling of the pandemic, but addressing Greece's entrenched structural problems will be extremely challenging and there remains a risk over the medium term that reforms could be rolled back or diluted.

Business environment outlook: Greece's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: The pro-business New Democracy (ND) government steps up efforts to revive its privatisation programme.
2023-25: Efforts to valorise public property through concession management and long-leasehold development agreements.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Cutting bureaucracy will be a focus; with this aim, the Investment Incentives Law of 2016 was supplemented by new legislation in October 2019.
2023-25: The 2019 "Fast-track" legislation could help to drive an investment recovery in "strategic" sectors such as energy, tourism, transport, communications and health. A further boost could come from EU recovery fund-related reforms
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Remaining capital controls were lifted in September 2019, but the public health crisis caused by the spread of the coronavirus disrupts international travel and trade.
2023-25: The risk of Greece leaving the euro zone is likely to rise in the long term if economic growth continues to disappoint. "Grexit" would probably result in the reintroduction of foreign-exchange controls and possibly restrictions on trade.
Taxes 2021-22: Extensive efforts to widen the tax base while lowering rates. The government pledges to pursue aggressive tax collection, but implementation is difficult. Mandatory introduction of electronic point-of-sale terminals helps.
2023-25: Slow progress in cutting corporate tax and value-added tax rates. Measures to tackle tax evasion are stepped up.
Financing 2021-22: Pressure to reduce non-performing loans (NPLs) intensifies, but foreign interest picks up. A moratorium on foreclosures is lifted for the majority of debtors. Liquidity is likely to remain tight owing to the coronavirus pandemic.
2023-25: The need to reduce continued high NPLs hampers lending. More Greek bank foreign subsidiaries are sold off.
The labour market 2021-22: Coronavirus crisis causes widespread job losses, keeping unemployment high. The government has pledged to cut social security contributions and continue to top up the income of employees in the worst-affected sectors.
2023-25: EU-funded job-creation schemes, particularly for youth, raise employment but create few productive jobs.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Energy infrastructure comes to the fore following the opening of the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) in January 2021.
2023-25: Technical assistance from the EU helps absorption of European funds to revive infrastructure investment.
Technological readiness 2021-22: Greece rolls out high-speed internet, at a slow pace. Private-sector adoption of electronic payments widens. The coronavirus crisis accelerates digitalisation of the public administration, which is one of the pillars of future reform plans.
2023-25: Significant financial and technical assistance from the EU, but Greece remains a laggard.

"Grexit" is no longer a risk in the medium term Greece's score for the macroeconomic environment is relatively low and improves only marginally in the forecast period, as the economy presents a mixed picture after the country's exit from the third economic adjustment programme in August 2018. The unemployment rate is the highest in the euro zone (16.2% in November 2020), and is not higher only thanks to the government's support measures to stave off bankruptcies during the pandemic. Households are highly indebted but debtors' primary residences have long been protected from foreclosure. This protection was set to expire in 2020 but has been extended during the pandemic. The insolvency framework has been modernised but a mixture of payment moratoria and court adjournments due to the pandemic has rendered it-for now-ineffective. The banking system is burdened with bad loans, although a workout including state guarantees for securitisation is under way. At the same time, the stock of public debt remains the highest in the euro zone (as a share of GDP) at 209%; the public sector is still inefficient, despite gradual reforms; and labour market and demographic trends are not conducive to growth.

- The ND government remains committed to the policy conditionality agreed with Greece's creditors, and is taking steps to take control of the reform agenda. The primary budget surplus targets, which are equivalent to 3.5% of GDP annually in 2019-22, declining to 2.2% from 2023, have been waived for both 2020 and 2021. This has enabled the government to put into place hefty support packages consisting of deferring tax payments, moratoria on foreclosures and even outright subsidies. Greece's creditors have praised the government's efforts to keep reform implementation on track. Financial markets have also been more positive about Greek sovereign debt, despite its size. Another debt write-down is unlikely, given that most of it is owed to Greece's official creditors. "Grexit" is no longer a risk in the medium term, largely because the short-term repayment schedule is manageable. However, it could rise again in the long run, given the size of the debt pile, and the uncertainties facing Greece and the wider region.

Efforts to promote competition are under way, but face headwinds Progress towards liberalisation, enhancing competition and privatising state-owned companies was uneven under the third three-year economic adjustment programme (EAP) agreed in 2015, largely because of weak implementation. The coronavirus pandemic in 2020 has disrupted the current government's efforts to get reforms back on track, but we expect some improvement during the forecast period. State asset ales brought in only EUR2.9bn in 2011-15 and cash receipts amounted to just one-fifth of the envisaged EUR2.5bn in 2016. The process picked up pace in 2017 to reach EUR1.4bn in sales, but as reform momentum waned only EUR1bn was raised in 2018. Of the EUR1.2bn raised in 2019, EUR1.1bn came from a single deal-the extension of the concession agreement for the Athens International Airport. In 2020, amid the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, revenue amounted to a mere EUR54m, against a target of EUR2.4bn. The Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (TAIPED) has set a target of EUR1.8bn for 2021.
Privatisation plans moving ahead
- Initial delays in launching the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (EESYP)-Greece's privatisation and investment fund, of which TAIPED is now a subsidiary-have been overcome. Under its strategic plan for the development, restructuring and sale of its assets, EESYP is working to improve corporate governance at the companies that it manages. The profits will be used to pay down public debt and boost investment in the economy, but implementation of the plan is likely to be protracted.
- In January 2021 a call for binding bids for the concession to operate the Egnatia highway was extended to April 1st 2021. The sale of shares in two regional ports (Alexandroupolis and Igoumenitsa) and a subconcession of a terminal for the Kavala port received strong investor interest in 2020. The sale for the development of Hellinikon, the site of the former international airport, is progressing; a casino licence, which was a prerequisite, has now been awarded and the breakdown of development land and assets that will remain public property has been agreed. Onsite work had begun on the project just prior to the onset of pandemic-related site closures.
- The long-delayed sale of a 66% stake in the Hellenic Gas Transmission System Operator (DESFA, which is 31% owned by TAIPED and 35% by Hellenic Petroleum, HELPE) to an international consortium comprising Snam (an Italian infrastructure company; 60%), Enagás (a Spanish energy company; 20%) and Fluxys (a Belgian natural gas transmission operator; 20%) was completed at the end of 2018. The conclusion of the DESFA process unlocked the process for the privatisation of the commercial division of the Public Gas Corporation (DEPA) and HELPE. In a tender for the state's stake in HELPE no bids materialised. A tender for DEPA attracted some interest in mid-2020 but has yet to be concluded.
- Laws put in place in 2011 and 2012 abolished restrictive practices in more than 150 professions, but they have not been fully applied. Implementation of the law has in many cases been left to professional groups, which have used their influence to maintain restrictive practices. Legislation has been passed to open network industries, but it is ponderous, and implementation will be slow.

Attracting foreign direct investment is high on the ND government's agenda The ND government has adopted a foreign direct investment (FDI) policy aimed at reversing a process of disinvestment that has been going on since 2010. Although we expect some reforms to be implemented during the forecast period, improving Greece's attractiveness as a location for FDI will be challenging. Persistent deterrents include complex and unevenly enforced legislation, frequent changes in tax laws and obstructive bureaucracy, which the current government is seeking to mitigate through the digitisation of procedures.

- The third EAP included policies to speed up company registration, "fast-track" investment (by facilitating approvals and relaxing regulation) and simplify export rules. The fast-track legislation covers investments that are deemed to be strategic. Priorities include industry, energy, tourism, transport, communication, health and waste management. The fast-track process provides for approval in one month by the Interministerial Committee for Strategic Investments (DESE) and facilitation of licensing and permitting applications (against payment of fees) within two months by the Ministry of Development's Enterprise Greece agency. The process did not start out smoothly. By February 2020, before the outbreak of the coronavirus, only 15 investments had been approved, according to the agency's website. A combination of the government's pro-business attitude and growing investor appetite resulted in this rising to 39 by February 2021.

Investors will be offered more tax breaks and fewer cash subsidies
- The investment incentives law (which provides for tax breaks and grants to promote regional development) involves the National Fund for Entrepreneurship and Development (ETEAN), which has now been recast as the Hellenic Development Bank (HDB). HDB operates in conjunction with commercial banks to provide financing for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, given Greek banks' high levels of non-performing loans (NPLs) and the difficulty facing banks in foreclosure cases, available funding is limited. HDB is supplemented by the Development Ministry with EU-led community support framework funding, as well as by Information Society, the government's technological consultancy arm. The result has often been confusing for SMEs, which have to invest a substantial amount of time in chasing up funding. In its first decade of operation (2010-19) the fund, according to its financial statements, managed to disburse 16,844 loans.
- In October 2019 the ND government passed Law 4635/2019 aimed at alleviating some of the bureaucratic burden generally, and specifically in more targeted sectors (for example, by simplifying the licensing of fifth-generation-5G-mobile telephony antennas). Some of the highlights include speeding up litigation via the introduction of an electronic filing system, the introduction of private-sector auditors for the evaluation of investment plans and curtailing administrative delays in land use approval, for example those determined by the archaeological agency. In December 2020 5G licences were awarded for EUR372m. In February 2021 the government also mended fences with Eldorado Gold, by signing an amended agreement covering many of the disputes that led to several lawsuits, which the government lost. Important investments were also announced in 2020 by Microsoft and Pfizer among others.
- In April 2013 an "investor ombudsman" service was set up to examine deadlocked investments and liaise with the relevant branch(es) of the public administration to remove stumbling blocks. The ombudsman, which is part of Enterprise Greece, is available for investments in excess of EUR2m. Enterprise Greece also runs a "golden visa" programme, which grants investors residence permits when investing in the country. About 8,000 of these had been granted up to end-2020, although the EU has called for a common European framework for such schemes, especially as regards background vetting.

On September 1st 2019 the new government abolished the remaining exchange and capital controls that had been put in place in June 2015 to prevent a mass withdrawal of cash from the banking system at the height of the debt crisis. The restrictions contravened the rules of the common currency, but the European Commission deemed them justifiable on the grounds of maintaining the stability of the Greek financial system. Their abolition is one of the main factors behind the significant score improvement for Greece in this category in 2021-25.

- As long as Greece remains a member of the EU (and the euro area), which we consider the most likely outcome, the country's foreign trade and exchange policy will be that of the EU. The EU remains committed to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and its dispute arbitration procedures, despite an appointment crisis at the WTO's Appellate Body since late 2019, which undermined their effectiveness. The change of administration in the US in January 2021 may help to resolve the crisis. Greece has so far been largely unaffected (directly) by the global pick-up in tariffs in recent years.
- Within the EU no tariffs or quotas are permitted, and the bloc has abolished most other non-tariff trade restrictions, such as health regulation that favours domestically produced goods. The EU has a customs union with Turkey; includes Norway and Iceland in the European Economic Area; and has a range of bilateral agreements enabling free trade and other economic exchange with Switzerland. Agriculture is excluded from all of these arrangements. Outside agriculture, trade with non-EU countries is mostly subject to moderate customs duties. The EU takes a liberal approach to trade in industrial goods. Average unweighted tariffs on these goods from "most-favoured nations" are 4%.
- The UK's relationship with the EU, following its exit from the bloc effective from the beginning of 2020, has been tense. A limited trade deal was agreed at the end of 2020, but technical issues remain unresolved. Greece's main exposure is in the important tourism sector, as the UK accounts for over 10% of total arrivals, although such concerns have been overshadowed by the disruption caused by coronavirus-related travel restrictions.

Efforts to reduce tax evasion will remain a government priority Improvement of tax collection is a major policy focus aimed at reducing widespread tax evasion and avoidance in order to increase tax revenue and widen the tax base so that high tax rates can be reduced. Some progress has been made since 2015, but tax increases since the start of the crisis in 2010 have also played a role in generating higher levels of government revenue. The 2018 budget included increases in social security contributions, tax rates for medium-sized and large properties, and value-added tax (VAT) rates on most Aegean islands, as well as a new hotel stay levy. The ND government is seeking to reverse the upward trend, and enacted corporate and real estate tax cuts in the 2020 budget. Plans to widen the base for property tax by aligning property tax values with market prices have been scaled down considerably as market prices have adjusted downwards during the coronavirus crisis.

- The overhaul of the tax administration has been painfully slow. The Independent Authority for Public Revenue (IAPR) only became operational in 2017 as an autonomous agency, following a series of ineffective reforms. However, with significant technical support from the Commission and the IMF, the IAPR has begun to shift from building its institutional capacity to enhancing its operational capacity and efficiency by adopting modern collection and audit tools, as well as increasing staffing levels. A new salary grid aimed at attracting high-calibre staff was passed in February 2021. Tax collection rose marginally (+0.3%) in 2019, despite a reduction in rates, but in 2020 the government adopted a series of deferrals, waivers and other measures to try to prevent business failures. However, more widespread use of electronic payments during the pandemic may help to tax evasion.

Some tax cuts under way, but Greece's high public debt to limit room for more
- Some tax cuts have been adopted since 2018. But given the size of the public debt, the overall tax burden is unlikely to be reduced substantially during the forecast period. The corporate income tax (CIT) rate is one of the highest in the EU, at 24% in 2020 (down from 29% in 2019), and, in addition, firms pay a fixed annual levy of EUR650 irrespective of profitability. The system is complex, adding to the administrative burden of compliance, and the burden of taxation on labour remains higher than the EU average.
- Under the enhanced surveillance regime, further reform of the tax administration will remain a priority. Efforts to improve the efficiency of the justice system have had mixed results, which suggests that progress towards reducing the backlog of tax appeal cases is also likely to be slow. Debt management units are being establised in all larger tax offices to concentrate on tax arrears that can be paid through the negotiation of instalment plans. All tax obligations must be settled through bank transfers coupled with tax identification measures; the use of cheques and cash has been abolished to reduce the scope for corruption of inspectors.

Banking sector focused on NPL reduction Greek banks went through a difficult time in 2010-14, and 2015 was even worse, culminating in a month-long bank holiday from June 28th and the imposition of capital controls, following accelerating capital flight. In 2012 rising NPLs and the 53.5% haircut on private-sector sovereign debt holdings (a 79% reduction in net present value) resulted in state-funded recapitalisation, followed by a new round of capital increases in 2014, which were privately funded. The stakes of the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) in the systemic banks at end-2019 were as follows: Eurobank Egrasias, 1.40%; National Bank of Greece, 40.39%; Alpha Bank, 10.96%; and Piraeus Bank, 26.42%. However, in November 2020 Piraeus skipped a payment of the coupons of its conditionally convertible bonds to the HFSF, triggering the process of their conversion. As a result, the state's stake will increase to 61.34%.

- In May 2018 the European Central Bank (ECB), the euro zone's banking watchdog, released the stress test results for the four "systemic" Greek banks. The testing was based on a baseline scenario that assumed annual average real GDP growth rates of 2.4% in 2018-20, and an adverse scenario that assumed a return to recession in 2018-19 and negligible growth in 2020. There are no official "pass rates", but unofficially a capitalisation rate of 5.5% or better under an adverse growth scenario is considered acceptable. All of the Greek banks met this benchmark, but they did not do so by a large margin owing mainly to the large NPL burden that continues to weigh on the Greek banking system. According to data from the Bank of Greece (the central bank), NPLs accounted for 35.3% of total loans in September 2020, down by more than 6 percentage points from 41.9% a year earlier and a further 7 percentage points from a high of 49.1% in mid-2017. A government project named Hercules, under which banks can shift loans to special purpose vehicles (SPVs) and issue tranches of debt on them with the government guaranteeing (against fair remuneration) the senior tranche, has helped to speed the process. New problem loans are likely to surface, however, once the coronavirus crisis abates, and the government is already considering a second tranche of Hercules to that effect. Stress tests by the European authorities are planned for 2021, but they are likely to be technically difficult to conduct.
- Domestic deposits at Greek banks remain well below pre-crisis levels after falling by 30% in 2009-12 and by another 25% in the first half of 2015. After stabilising as a result of capital controls in 2015-17, they began to increase gradually again towards the end of 2017. The pace picked up after the 2019 election and the abolition of capital controls, returning deposits at end-2020 approximately back to their end-2014 levels.
- Bank credit contracted for 36 consecutive quarters to March 2020 but started to pick up during the pandemic as a result of government support for businesses. We expect lending to the private sector to remain constrained under the weight of NPLs during most of the forecast period. Despite the Hercules plan, progress is constrained by weak bank profitability, new moratoria on repossessions and a likely new bout of bad loans. A new insolvency framework, which took effect in January 2021, is intended to address many of the issues that have hindered banks' ability to clean up their balance sheets.

Labour market gradually becoming more flexible, but progress is slow Greece's labour market has been one of the least flexible in the euro area. However, this began to change in 2010. In addition to greater flexibility regarding redundancies and a reduction of redundancy compensation, reforms should enable company-level collective agreements to prevail over those at the sectoral and occupational levels. Another law provided for flexible working time, including part-time shift work. The government, under pressure from creditors to liberalise the market and after losing a precedent-setting case at the European Court of Justice, abolished in May 2017 the discretionary right of the labour minister to approve collective dismissals in the private sector. A further reform package scheduled to be enacted in 2021 includes provisions to limit the scope for industrial action, more flexibility in working hours and a capitalisation social security pillar (Greece's state-run system is solely redistributive).
Unemployment likely to rise again as government withdraws support
- Labour market liberalisation and economic recovery, as well as emigration of mainly young Greeks and government support during the coronavirus pandemic, has helped to reduce the unemployment rate, which was 16.2% in November 2020, down from a peak of 27.9% in July 2013 during the sovereign debt crisis. Government measures prevented a sharp rise in unemployment during the coronavirus pandemic-induced lockdowns, but we expect job losses to rise as support measures are gradually withdrawn.
- The rise of unemployment during the sovereign debt crisis was accom-panied by sharp wage cuts, which were reduced three times in the public sector in 2010-12. In 2012 the government slashed the minimum wage for over-25-year-olds by 22% and by 32% for under 25s. The minimum wage remained unchanged until February 2019, when a single rate was restored and increased by 10.9% to EUR650 per month (still 14 annual payments). A review of the minimum wage scheduled for 2020 was deferred to 2021 as result of the coronavirus outbreak.

Statutory pension age has increased, and is likely to rise further
- Primary (pillar one) pensions in the public and private sectors were reformed in 2011. In 2015 new legislation introduced penalties for early retirement in an attempt to address loopholes that let people collect pension benefits at an average age of 57-58. In May 2016 a new way of calculating pensions was introduced. It reduced auxiliary pensions, partially stopped the payment of a special social solidarity allowance for low-income pensioners (EKAS), cut high-end pensions and widower pensions, and increased insurance contributions for employers, employees and farmers. Starting in 2017, contributions were further increased for freelancers and civil servants. The private sector is now almost exclusively served by a single fund that came about from the merger of eight smaller ones in 2017. The statutory pension age is 67, and the number of years of contributions necessary to secure a full pension is 40. The minimum pension eligibility age is 62. In 2020 further reforms gave the self-employed greater flexibility in their choice of pension plan and digitised parts of the social security process.
- From 2021 the statutory pension age and the minimum pension eligibility ages, of 67 and 62, will be revised every three years, in line with life expectancy. In the future pensions will be based on full earnings history, and accrual rates will be reduced so that the replacement ratio will drop from about 80% to 64%.
- Future Greek governments may regret the decision (approved by the Commission) not to include previously agreed pension cuts in the 2019 budget, because they were deemed unnecessary to meet the government's primary budget surplus target of 3.5% of GDP. The cuts were designed to reduce the difference between the higher pension levels of those drawing their pensions before the 2016 reform and those drawing them after. With budget targets on hold, the issue is not likely to come to the fore before 2022 at the earliest.
- According to the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 test scores, 31% of Greek 15-year-olds were "low achievers" in reading and 36% in mathematics, compared with OECD averages of 23% and 24% respectively. Two reforms have been passed on the education front, covering vocational training (December 2020) and higher education (February 2021), which the Commission's ninth enhanced surveillance review considers ambitious. Persistently high youth unemployment has led more than 400,000 young educated Greeks to seek work abroad. With a labour force of about 4.6m, this will have a lasting negative effect on Greece's labour market.

Major deficiencies in infrastructure will remain The poor quality of Greece's transport and communications networks is holding back the country's international trade and investment potential. Delays to plans to improve infrastructure arise for a variety of reasons, including scarcity of funds, despite the availability of EU monies; administrative complexity; and political opposition at local and national level. The main gaps include the need to upgrade the existing rail network; improve interconnections between domestic and international transport links; overhaul the coastal shipping network to improve the accessibility of islands and reduce over-reliance on the port of Piraeus; and promote multi-modal freight transport by improving rail connections to Trans-European Transport Network ports such as Thessaloniki. Because of a lack of investment, Greece has lagged well behind most of the rest of the EU in the move to fast broadband in terms of both the availability of higher speeds and coverage.

- A motorway (Pathe) runs between Athens, the capital, and Thessaloniki, on the east coast of the mainland, and a highway-standard link (Egnatia) runs across the north from the port of Igoumenitsa to the Turkish border. However, nine uplinks from Egnatia to the Balkans remain uncompleted. The tendering of a long-term concession for Egnatia and three of its uplinks is under way, with binding bids now expected in April 2021, after repeated extensions.
- The government created a special purpose vehicle (SVP) called Hellenic Motorways, where the state allocated its concession rights from five concession toll roads contracted by the government in the early 2000s. As the economic downturn stalled projects, the government renegotiated the concession contracts in 2013, with the Commission approving related funding of EUR2.97bn. The works were largely concluded in 2017. The central Greece highway's southern portion is scheduled for completion in 2021, after an extra EUR306m was approved in October 2018. A northern portion costing EUR442m was agreed in early 2021 and is scheduled to be completed within three years.

ND government has renewed focus on investment
- The government wants to couple management concessions for infrastructure projects such as the railway system, ports and airports with development financing. In August 2016 a Chinese logistics company, Cosco, which in 2010 won a EUR5bn, 35-year concession to manage two of three piers at the main container depot at Piraeus, paid EUR280.5m to acquire a majority stake in the third pier and promised to invest a further EUR350m within the next decade. Of this, EUR294m was supposed to be completed in five years, which would allow Cosco to exercise a right to increase its stake to two-thirds for an additional consideration of EUR88m. Cosco has attributed delays in the execution of the investment plan to licensing delays by the state, and has requested to exercise the option to increase its stake regardless. In March 2018 a 67% stake in the Thessaloniki port authority was sold to a consortium of international and domestic companies for EUR232m upfront plus a portion of revenue annually. The buyers also agreed to undertake investments of EUR180m over the next seven years.
- In April 2017 Germany's Fraport entered a 40-year concession to manage 14 regional airports. It paid EUR1.2bn upfront and will pay both an annual flat fee of EUR23m and a portion of operating profits. It has also undertaken to invest EUR330m in the airports by end-2020. In February 2019 an agreement to extend the concession for Athens International Airport for 20 years (from 2026 onwards) to the current concessionaire was signed for EUR1.4bn. The state sub-sequently started a tender to sell TAIPED's 30% stake in the airport. As at end-January 2020 nine bidding groups had pre-qualified for participation, but the pandemic has stalled the process.

Greece scores relatively poorly on technological readiness, which measures how future-oriented the business environment is-the extent to which it is digitally connected, open to innovation and prepared for technological disruption. Furthermore, this is the only area in which it shows no improvement between the historical period and the forecast period, despite the pro-business government that was elected in mid-2019 and the planned return to growth that the government seems intent on supporting via investment.

- Our Inclusive Internet Index ranks Greece 40th out of 100 countries and second to last in the EU. The index ranks countries on four different axes: availability, readiness, affordability and relevance. Greece scores poorly on most fronts, and with only availability improving. In the EU's Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) Greece ranked 26th out of 27 in 2020. In the UN's E-Government Survey 2020, Greece ranked 42nd out of 193 countries for e-government development-down from 35th in 2018. In the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2020, Greece is amongst the least prepared countries to create a vibrant business environment, scoring 47.2 (out of 100) on economic transformation readiness.
- In 2017 Greece's telecoms regulator approved a two-year roll-out plan for very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL) vectoring technology that will, when completed, considerably improve high-speed internet availability in Greece. However, the plan is facing delays and is being amended on a rolling basis. The government's targets are also unrealistic. For instance, by end-2020 it aimed to provide internet access of more than 30 Megabits per second (Mbps) to all Greeks and a connection with a speed of more than 100 Mbps to at least 50% of households (take-up was less than 1% in 2019). The pandemic-induced lockdown accentuated the need for strong broadband to cover remote working, education and entertainment needs, and is likely to have spurred action in this area.

Economic forecast: Policy trends The severe recession triggered by the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic has compounded the economic policy challenges facing the government during the forecast period. In the short term, the focus will be on bringing the recent rise of infections under control, rolling out available vaccines and reopening the economy after the reimposition of restrictions since mid-September 2020. Over the medium to long term, the main challenges will be diversifying economic activity to reduce over-dependence on tourism, improving competitiveness and putting the public finances on a more sustainable footing.
Greece is to receive a total of EUR30.5bn (about 18% of GDP), comprising about EUR17.8bn in grants and EUR12.7bn in loans, from the EU recovery fund designed to support the member states that have been worst affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Added to the EU's multi-annual financial framework, Greece is set to receive a total of about EUR72bn in EU funds in 2021-27. The impact on the economy could be huge, providing an annual boost to real GDP of up to 2 percentage points over the medium term, according to the Bank of Greece (the central bank). However, the effectiveness of the funds will depend on the government implementing reforms to address the long-standing shortcomings in Greece's business environment, such as inefficiencies in the public administration and the judicial system; a complex tax regime and high social security contributions; skills mismatches in the labour market, low productivity and restrictive employment laws; and modest levels of investment in research and development.
Greece remains under "enhanced surveillance" by its euro zone creditors. To allow the government to respond to the coronavirus crisis, the creditors have waived the country's primary budget surplus target of 3.5% of GDP until at least 2022. However, they are still pressing Greece to accelerate other reforms, including plans to reduce banks' heavy burden of non-performing loans to ensure the stability of the country's credit institutions and revive lending.
Since the end of its bail-out programme in August 2018, the Greek government has maintained a substantial cash buffer comprising money raised on inter-national markets and unused loans from official creditors. At EUR31bn as at end-December 2020, the reserve would be sufficient to cover about two years of financing needs, even without further bond issuances. The stated goal of the Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA) is to maintain the reserve at about EUR30bn in the coming years. In 2021 it plans to issue EUR8bn-12bn (including Treasury-bill auctions), providing enough funds to finance its anti-pandemic support measures and repay early EUR3.6bn in IMF loans due in 2021-22. Taking advantage of the favourable market conditions, the Ministry of Finance returned to the market in January 2021, raising EUR3.5bn with a new ten-year bond issue at a record-low yield of 0.75%. This followed EUR2bn that was raised from the reopening of a 30-year bond through a private placement with two Greek banks.
Greece's qualification for support from the European Central Bank (ECB) and financial assistance from the EU's recovery fund will help to contain government borrowing costs. Despite a global pick-up in bond yields in February, the secondary-market interest rate on benchmark ten-year Greek government bonds was still just 0.8% at end-February 2021, which is well below the spike of about 3.5% in mid-March 2020 and the 5-5.5% rates in July 2017, when the government returned to the debt markets after a three-year absence. Investors have been attracted to Greek bonds, which offer relatively good returns, given the current ultra-low-interest-rate environment.
Over the medium term, a further increase in risk aversion in the global financial markets, or signs of tension between the government and its international creditors (for example, over how quickly Greece returns to compliance with its budgetary and other commitments under the post-bail-out programme) could cause Greek yields to rise again sharply.

Government debt 209.0 206.6 195.9 189.7 183.4 178.0
Reflecting the severe impact of the public health crisis on the public finances, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects both the budget and the primary balance to have recorded deficits in 2020-of 9.2% and 7.3% of GDP respectively-and estimate that the government debt/GDP ratio rose by almost 30 percentage points, to 209% by end-2020. The government is unlikely to start to retrench until 2022 when the economic recovery is more solid, but we expect the deficit to start to narrow in 2021, helping to stabilise the debt/GDP burden. From 2022/23 we also expect disbursements of grants under the EU recovery fund to boost economic growth and reduce the deficit further, to 1.9% of GDP by 2025. Our baseline forecast is that a return to economic growth and tighter fiscal policy will help the government debt/GDP ratio to decline gradually from 2021, to 178% in 2025.

The monetary policy of the ECB will remain highly accommodative until at least the end of 2023. The overnight interbank rate (EONIA) has been negative since October 2014 and stood at -0.48% in January. With policy rates at their effective lower bound, monetary policy is now conducted primarily through quantitative easing (QE). The ECB restarted asset purchases in November 2019 at an average monthly pace of EUR20bn, as the euro zone economy was slowing. In 2020 the bank adopted further stimulus measures to contain the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus: an extra round of QE worth EUR120bn, a EUR1.85trn pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), liquidity injections at negative rates and easier capital and collateral requirements for banks.
We expect the ECB to use the PEPP envelope in full. Therefore, after EUR1.1trn of asset purchases in 2020, we expect additional purchases worth EUR1.1trn in 2021 and EUR460bn in 2022. The bank will maintain its QE programme into 2023, when we forecast that inflation will continue to undershoot its target of just below 2%. We do not expect policy rates to increase by the end of 2025.
The ECB's actions have prevented a credit crunch in the euro zone: borrowing costs for households and businesses are at historically low levels and this will continue for the next few years, supporting the economic recovery. However, the pandemic poses challenges to credit markets: banks tightened credit standards for businesses in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 owing to increased risk perception, and collateral requirements have reached the highest value since the third quarter of 2009.

Greece's economy was in a relatively weak position when the coronavirus crisis and the emergency measures adopted to contain it triggered a severe downturn in the second quarter of 2020. Despite three consecutive years of real GDP growth, averaging a moderate 1.5% per year in 2017-19, real GDP remained about 24% below the level recorded before the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Reflecting the impact of the severe contraction in the second quarter of 2020 followed by only a modest recovery in the third, and the reimposition of a national lockdown since November, we estimate that the economy shrank by 9.9% in real terms last year, reversing the gains made since 2017. With the recovery pushed back by one or two quarters into 2021, we forecast only a gradual pick-up in activity, to real GDP growth of 3.2% this year and 5.7% in 2022, reflecting in part our expectation that the EU recovery fund will lift output as government support measures for households and businesses are gradually withdrawn. We expect the economy to expand by an average of 3.2% per year in 2023-25. Nevertheless, real GDP is not expected to return to pre-coronavirus levels until 2023.
The main driver of the contraction in 2020 was a sharp fall in activity in the tourism sector, which has accounted for between 21% and 25% of GDP (including indirect effects) and about half of growth in the overall economy in recent years. A combination of high unemployment, high direct and indirect tax rates to reverse a renewed surge in government debt, heavy household debt relative to disposable income and tight credit conditions will continue to put pressure on private consumption. After an estimated 3.8% contraction in 2020, we expect a moderate recovery, with private consumption growth averaging 2.3% per year in 2021-25.
In response to the public health crisis, we expect government consumption growth to have accelerated to an estimated 2.2% in 2020 and forecast average annual growth of 3.5% per year in 2021-25. We expect that pressure on Greece from its international creditors to reduce the budget deficit will be partly offset by a boost to government spending from the EU recovery fund.
We estimate that real fixed investment contracted by 2.5% in 2020 as businesses reduced capital spending amid the uncertainty of the coronavirus crisis and as the government focused on current spending to support the healthcare system, businesses and the unemployed. As confidence returns and EU recovery funding is disbursed, we expect investment to recover, recording average annual growth of 10.1% per year in 2021-25. However, the recovery will only partly offset the severe depletion of Greece's capital stock during the previous economic crisis.
Greece has a relatively small, uncompetitive goods export sector, so the impact on growth of supply-chain disruptions and a sharp contraction in world trade will be limited. However, we expect a global economic slump and domestic and international travel restrictions to deal a heavy blow to Greece's shipping services, as well as to travel and tourism. We estimate that real exports of goods and services declined by 29.3% in 2020. We forecast a gradual recovery, with annual average growth of 5.3% in 2021-25.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends Greece's economy is driven by services, particularly shipping and tourism, and the related real estate sector, as well as financial services, although the relative size of this sector has declined considerably, reflecting the difficulties that the banking system has faced since the sovereign debt crisis. All of these sectors have also been particularly badly affected by the coronavirus pandemic and the restrictions put in place to contain it. This is likely to reduce significantly, at least in the short term, their contributions to the overall economy in terms of growth and employment, especially in the tourism and travel sector. The government is also seeking to diversify the economy further to reduce its over-dependence on tourism and travel by focusing on the development of green and digital industries, but the shift is likely to be slow, given entrenched resistance to reform.
Output in the industrial sector (including construction), which before the pandemic accounted for about 15% of gross value added (GVA) in nominal terms-one of lowest levels in the EU-contracted sharply during the sovereign debt crisis years, before recovering gradually from 2016. Although GVA in the sector contracted in real terms in 2020, its share of the total in nominal terms is expected to have increased, owing to a much sharper decline in the services sector.
After contracting in real terms in the eight years to 2018, real estate activity started to pick up modestly in 2017-19 and is estimated to have held up relatively well in 2020, despite the severity of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the tourism sector on which it is largely dependent. The sector accounted for a relatively large 16% of GVA in 2019. The share is likely to have increased in 2020, owing to falls in harder-hit sectors.
The financial services sector went through a difficult period in the ten years to 2019, suffering from weak profitability, a huge depletion of assets, deleveraging and a major asset quality problem; non-performing loans (NPLs) were about 41% of total loans at end-2019. The sector's growth prospects will be strongly correlated with political stability, continued reform progress now that the third economic adjustment programme has ended (in August 2018), and its ability to reduce NPLs and revive lending. NPLs have been steadily declining, but the ratio of NPLs to total loans remained high at 35.8% as at the end of the third quarter of 2020, and NPLs are likely to rise again when insolvencies increase as the government withdraws pandemic-related support. Profitability is also likely to continue to be squeezed by the low interest rate environment in the euro zone.
Greece's shipping industry employs 250,000 people and makes an important contribution to the country's GDP. Demand for shipping declined dramatically from mid-2008 to early 2009, owing primarily to sharp reductions in cargoes of commodities such as iron ore and coal. Compared with a peak of 11,793 in May 2008, the Baltic Dry Index (BDI, which measures the demand for shipping capacity against the supply of dry bulk carriers) plummeted during the global financial crisis and has fluctuated in a range of 250-4,100, reflecting bouts of global and regional economic uncertainty, as well as periodic concerns about excess supply in the industry, international trade tensions and, most recently, the negative impact of the novel coronavirus. At the beginning of March 2021 the index stood at about 1,900, up from about 1,200 in early October 2020.
Health of Chinese economy is biggest risk to global economy We estimate that the pace of world trade growth slowed from 5.8% in 2017 to an estimated 0.9% in 2019, before plunging by 9.6% in 2020. Our baseline forecast is that world trade will recover from 2021, averaging annual growth of about 5.5% in 2021-25, but this assumes that the coronavirus pandemic will be brought under control. This should be sufficient to underpin growth in shipping, as long as shipping companies can manage oversupply problems.
Tourism will be main driver of growth in services The tourism sector plays a major role in the Greek economy and was one of a few bright spots during the country's near-decade-long economic depression. According to World Travel and Tourism Council 2019 data, it contributes about 7.5% to GDP directly and about 20% including indirect effects. Employment in the sector is about 11.5% of total employment directly and 22% including related sectors. In terms of foreign-currency earnings based on the balance of payments, travel credits amounted to EUR18.2bn-or 8.2% of estimated GDP-in 2019, compared with about 2% in France, 5% in Spain and 8% in Portugal. Greece had another record year for tourism in 2019, with just over 31m arrivals, compared with 30m in 2018, about 27m in 2017 and 25m in 2016.
However, the sector has been one of the worst affected by the coronavirus pandemic, with arrivals slumping to 7.4m in 2020. We expect the sector to recover gradually from 2021, but much will depend on the extent to which travel restrictions remain in place and the success of the vaccination programme in Greece and its major tourist markets. The medium-term outlook for the sector remains reasonably positive, owing to competitive pricing and the perception, at least so far, that it has managed the pandemic better than some rival tourism destinations.

Despite a return to economic growth in 2017-19, significant slack in the Greek labour market, subdued domestic demand and low global oil prices have dampened inflationary pressures. Reflecting a further sharp fall in global energy prices and depressed aggregate demand, Greece's headline consumer price index (EU harmonised measure, seasonally adjusted) declined by an average of 1.3% in 2020. As Greek domestic demand and international energy prices recover, we expect prices to rise gradually, with annual consumer price inflation averaging 0% in 2021 and 1.5% per year in 2022-25.

The euro experienced volatility throughout 2020. A depreciation against the US dollar in the early months of the year, when the coronavirus forced European countries into lockdowns, was followed by a rapid appreciation after the EU announced the establishment of a new recovery fund worth EUR750bn. We forecast that the single currency will stabilise at an average of US$1.21:EUR1 in 2021, supported by the weakness of the US dollar. In 2022-23 we expect depreciation against the dollar, owing to a protracted economic recovery, muted inflation and continued monetary accommodation from the ECB, which will maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy stance for longer than the Federal Reserve (the US central bank). The euro will strengthen from 2024 onwards, supported by the euro zone's structural current-account surplus and by the gradual unwinding of the ECB's asset purchases.

The compression of imports, owing to weak domestic demand and strong tourism earnings growth, helped to reduce the current-account deficit to 1.5% of GDP in 2019, compared with an annual average of 6.5% of GDP since Greece joined the euro zone in 2001. We expect that the deficit widened to 6.3% of GDP in 2020, as tourism earnings have decreased more sharply than imports of goods and services, and forecast a still-large deficit of 5.1% of GDP in 2021. We forecast that the deficit will shrink subsequently, averaging 3.6% of GDP per year in 2022-25, mainly reflecting a recovery in the tourism sector and the transfer of grants from the EU recovery fund.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Greece Stocks and flows Greece is a small host of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) compared with other EU countries. Stocks and inflows are well below those of many of the central and east European countries that joined the EU in 2004. FDI outflows have in some years exceeded inflows. Most inflows have been for the acquisition of existing companies either through privatisation sales or joint ventures with local partners. There has been significant disinvestment since the advent of the sovereign debt crisis, particularly in the retail and banking sectors; according to data from the IMF (based on data by the Bank of Greece, the central bank), the stock of FDI fell from a peak of US$55.1bn (17.3% of GDP) in 2007 to US$25.6bn (10.8% of GDP) in 2014. The stock has since risen, to US$49bn (24% of GDP) at the end of 2019 (latest available data), but is likely to have fallen again in 2020 owing to the disruption caused by the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Despite the increase in 2015-19, Greece's FDI stock remained far below the levels of new EU member states in the former communist Balkans, Bulgaria (US$51bn; 74% of GDP) and Romania (US$110bn; 44% of GDP). Greek companies' FDI stock abroad was US$51.7bn (17.9% of GDP) at end-2011. Much of this outward investment was in the Balkan region, although Greek companies have also looked further afield, to invest in North Africa, Turkey and, in a few cases, the US. The outward stock had declined to US$23bn by end-2019, equivalent to 11.3% of GDP, as a result of retrenchment by Greek companies and banks.
With FDI inflows drying up after the onset of the economic crisis and outflows falling less sharply, net negative FDI flows were registered in 2010-11. In 2012-13 net inflows turned positive, but this was mainly the result of inflows from foreign banks recapitalising subsidiaries before divestment. Net inflows turned negative again in 2014-15, amid acute political and economic uncertainty. In 2016-18, after Greece signed a third economic adjustment programme in August 2015, there was a pick-up in FDI inflows and positive net investment, to US$5bn and US$4.4bn respectively in 2019-the fourth consecutive year of positive net investment.
Origin and distribution Historically, the US was a major source of FDI for Greece in heavy industries such as refining and chemicals. However, since Greece entered the common market, EU countries, particularly Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (because of its status as a financial hub for special-purpose entities-SPEs-created by multinationals for inward and outward FDI), have become the main investors, primarily in financial services and telecommunications, as these sectors have been liberalised. However, since the height of the Greek crisis most foreign firms have sold off their interests in Greece's financial services sector, resulting in net negative inward FDI stock figures for the sector for eight consecutive years in 2012-19, according to Bank of Greece data. In 2019 Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg accounted for 56% of Greece's total inward FDI stock. However, retrenchment in Europe has led to a search for funding from Middle Eastern sovereign funds (Dubai and Qatar) and pursuit of investment from China, particularly through the China Development Bank. A number of Chinese transport and logistics companies have made large investments in Greece with a view to creating a gateway into the EU for Chinese manufactures. According to the Bank of Greece, in 2019 information and communication accounted for the largest share of the inward FDI stock, at 15%, followed by retail and wholesale trade (14.7%); refined petroleum, chemical products, pharmaceutical and plastic products (9.6%); and transport and storage (9.3%). Encouraged by government incentives, foreign real estate investment has risen sharply, accounting for 8.4% of total FDI stock in 2019. Probably reflecting the predominance of small, family-owned operations in the tourism industry, the hotel and restaurant sector FDI stock is modest at just 2.4% of the total, given the sector's overall importance in the Greek economy.
Determinants Factors that have traditionally held back greater levels of inward direct investment include Greece's geographical remoteness from core EU markets; its small domestic market; excessive product and market regulation; underdeveloped transport and communications infrastructure; a reluctance to allow companies in so-called strategic sectors to be majority foreign-owned; widespread red tape and corruption; and an unstable tax regime. Political factors have sometimes come into play, such as Greece's historically tense relations with Turkey.
Impact The share of FDI inflows in gross fixed investment in Greece is well below the EU average. Increased foreign participation in privatised or part-privatised companies would boost productivity. In April 2016 Greece sold a majority stake in Piraeus Port Authority, the state-owned company that controls Pier I and the port's cruise, passenger and car terminal operations, to China's Cosco. The investment has turned Piraeus into one of the biggest and fastest-growing ports in the region, opening the way for the site to become a major multimodal transhipment hub in the Mediterranean and the most important sea trade gateway into Europe, potentially bringing significant benefits to the economy. Investment by South Europe Gateway Thessaloniki (SEGT), the German-led consortium that operates the Thessaloniki Port Authority, has helped to increase throughput at Greece's second-largest port. This rose by more than 7% in 2018, following SEGT's 67% stake purchase in March of that year.
Potential Greece holds relatively few attractions for FDI in the short term for investors, with the exception of investors specialising in distressed assets. The payoff from structural reforms in terms of increased competitiveness will take years to materialise fully and could yet be reversed in the medium term now that Greece has exited its EU-backed economic adjustment programme. In the medium term the country will offer opportunities for investment in renewable energy and greenfield new technology ventures if red tape continues to be reduced and the reduction in labour costs is maintained. The Economist Intelligence Unit projects average annual FDI inflows of about US$5bn in 2021-25 (the forecast period).

Age structure set to change dramatically over long term According to UN projections, the population will decline by an average of 0.5% per year in 2021-25 (the forecast period). However, life expectancy is increasing, and in 2020 it was estimated to average 81.6 years-broadly in line with the EU27 average of 81.3 (2019). The population structure by age already bears all the hallmarks of the demographic ageing process, with the decline in the working-age population and rise in the elderly population (65 years and older) projected to continue. The proportion of people aged over 65 is forecast to rise from an estimated 22.4% in 2020 to 24% in 2025. Population ageing will prove to be a burden on already heavily indebted social services, particularly the pension and healthcare systems.
The economic impact of an ageing population will be exacerbated to some degree by the continued decline in the working-age population during the forecast period, which means that the old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of people aged above 65 to the working-age population) will rise compared with the previous five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that the population of people of working age will decrease by an average of 0.7% per year in 2021-25, which is marginally slower than the average in 2016-20. The labour force, however, is now projected to rise by an average of 0.4% over the forecast period, reversing a sharp decline of 1% on average in 2016-20, driven by higher participation rates due to a rise in the effective retirement age and an increase in the number of women in work. The decline in the historical period reflects the impact of the emigration of young, skilled workers leaving Greece to seek employment opportunities elsewhere and the arrival of fewer economic migrants. The labour force participation rate for women is much lower than that for men and is one of the lowest in the EU. The gender gap (the difference between the employment rates of men and women of working age (15-64) in Greece was about 16.5 percentage points in 2020 (Eurostat), compared with an EU28 average of just under 11 percentage points. The narrowest gap (about 3 percentage points) was in Lithuania and the widest in Romania (about 19 percentage points). In November 2020 the seasonally adjusted unemploy-ment rate for males was 13.2%, compared with 20% for females. We expect to see a gradual increase in the employment rate for women and a narrowing of the gender gap in unemployment rates over the medium and long term.
According to Eurostat, the foreign-born population of Greece as at January 1st 2020 was 1.35m-equivalent to 12.6% of the total population, 3.3% being EU-born and 9.3% born outside the EU. In 2015 controversial legislation granted Greek citizenship to second-generation immigrants. Prior to the new law, children born to migrants in Greece received a "maternity clinic certificate", not a birth certificate, leaving them without proper legal status. As they were not Greek nationals, they were not entitled to the same rights-such as travelling, working and studying within the EU-as EU citizens.
The migrant influx via Turkey and Greece into Europe in 2015-16 posed big challenges for the authorities. About 800,000 migrants arrived in Greece in 2015, according to the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. The closure of the western Balkan migrant route in February 2016 led to about 55,000 migrants becoming trapped in Greece. In March 2016 the Turkey-EU joint action plan stemmed the influx into Greece of migrants from Turkey. However, Greece is vulnerable to another migration upsurge given its extensive and porous land and sea borders, the refugee crisis in Syria and an increase in tensions with Turkey.
Immigration has become contentious issue Legislation regarding permanent residence and working rights is in line with EU regulations, allowing non-EU persons legally resident in the country for five years to acquire permanent resident status. Since 2006 all immigration has been linked to employment criteria based on available jobs, and these are posted at consulates abroad. Persons wishing to work in Greece have to acquire a permit through the consulate in their home country before arriving. Persons arriving in the country on student or tourist permits are not allowed to change their status and take employment. Those seeking to establish themselves in Greece as self-employed or as entrepreneurs have had to fulfil detailed criteria demonstrating their relevant experience and supply evidence of having sufficient funds to support themselves so that they do not become dependent on the state. In 2020 the government introduced a 7% flat income tax rate for ten years for new foreign retirees to Greece. In early 2021 the government announced plans to introduce a special visa regime and generous tax relief for foreign, self-employed digital workers.

Greece is a small, fragmented market of about 10.5m people, about 12% of whom live on its many islands. As a result, distribution has typically been a problem, which is exacerbated when the population is swollen by large numbers of tourists in the high season. In 2019 Greece attracted a record 31m visitors (almost triple the population of Greece itself). However, international travel restrictions introduced in response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak since March 2020 caused the number of foreign visitors to the country to plummet by nearly 80% in 2020. We expect a gradual recovery in the number of visitors from 2021, although this will depend on the success of the vaccination programmes in Greece's main tourist markets and the effectiveness of the government's measures to tackle a resurgence of the pandemic in late 2020. The recovery of the tourism industry (and associated real estate) sector, should revive market opportunities, despite the moderate projected growth of the wider Greek economy.
Even after coronavirus-related international travel restrictions are lifted, the movement of commercial visitors to and from non-EU countries will continue to be affected, particularly as Greece is a signatory to the Schengen Agreement, which places tough controls on external borders. Greece has been in the front line of recent mass migration into Europe-mainly from the Middle East and North Africa-that peaked in 2015. Road and rail development should gradually improve access between Greece and its Balkan neighbours in the coming years, enhancing the country's role as a distribution centre for the southern Balkans, as will development of the ports of Thessaloniki, Kavala and Alexandroupolis.
Market opportunities will pick up but consumer spending power constrained Over the forecast period (2021-25) market opportunities in Greece will be constrained by consumers' limited spending power. The coronavirus-related economic slump in 2020, still-high unemployment, high taxes, only a partial recovery in wage levels, tight credit conditions and the need to attain large government primary surplus targets to reduce Greece's huge public debt of over 200% of GDP will make consumers cautious about spending over the forecast period. During the pandemic GDP per head (at market exchange rates) slumped to an estimated US$18,116 in 2020-well below the EU average. This is forecast to rise to US$24,828 by 2025. This primarily reflects a projected recovery in GDP, from a low base, following the coronavirus crisis, but also a shrinking population.
The after-effects of the coronavirus crisis in 2020-21 will continue to reshape market opportunities, which changed considerably during the depression in 2008-13, the truncated recovery in 2014 and the renewed economic downturn in 2015-16. A return to the rapid pre-crisis increases in one-person households is unlikely over the medium term, as the number of single people able to afford their own household will not continue to rise. This will have negative follow-through effects on demand in various consumer goods markets, such as white goods, consumer electronics and furniture. Other consumer durables that relied on a buoyant, debt-fuelled economy for sales growth are also likely to suffer, as low consumer confidence will mean that households will show restraint with regard to big-ticket purchases in the forecast period. Internal migration to the cities will continue, although at a slower rate than before the sovereign debt crisis, as young people abandon farming because of falling EU subsidies and the hope of better employment opportunities in the big cities: Athens (the capital), Thessaloniki and Larissa.

Demand for healthcare and communication services will rise Food, beverages and tobacco, together with housing, household fuel, and household goods and services, absorbed about 50% of consumer expenditure in 2020, declining to about 47% in 2025. Demand for housing will fall as a percentage of GDP compared with other items over the forecast period, in line with the broadly stagnant number of households over the next five years. Non-essential spending will generally also be held back by increased saving efforts by the population, as well as debt-reduction moves. Greater spending power among the immigrant community and population ageing will have important influences on consumption patterns during the forecast period, providing support to demand for communication and healthcare services.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
The negative effect of ageing will become more pronounced over time The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that Greek real GDP growth will average 1.5% per year in 2021-50. We expect annual growth to average 2.5% in 2021-30, slowing to 1% in 2031-50. This trajectory reflects the greater negative effect of demographic trends in 2031-50 compared with 2020-30, especially the contraction in the working-age population, which becomes more significant as time goes on. Reasonable total factor productivity and capital stock growth will support a continued economic expansion in 2021-50, offsetting the negative contribution of labour to GDP growth from 2030.
Initial conditions: Several factors will hold back potential long-term GDP growth in Greece. The economy has a number of deep structural flaws that will continue to hinder growth in 2021-30 and 2031-50. In particular, a decline of just over 65% in real fixed investment in 2008-20 will undermine the economy's ability to generate growth over the longer term. It also remains to be seen how much permanent damage is inflicted by the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic crisis in terms of, for example, labour market scarring and possible changes in international travel trends. There could be a significant boost to growth potential if the availability of EU recovery funds from 2022 spurs economic reforms, although our baseline forecast assumes that existing political and institutional shortcomings will continue to hinder implementation. We expect that agricultural products, renewable energy, tourism and shipping will remain Greece's principal exports in the long term, but the success of these and other industries will also depend on the restoration of competitiveness to the economy inside the euro zone (we are sceptical that a return to competitiveness and catch-up growth can be accomplished as long as Greece retains the euro, hence our forecast that "Grexit" is more likely than not over the long term). A marked deterioration in the demographic profile will result in diminishing opportunities to increase labour utilisation.
Demographic trends: The demographic profile becomes increasingly unfavourable in 2021-50. The working-age population will decline steadily, despite immigration. Life expectancy is high, reflecting good living conditions and health standards (at least until recently). The birth rate is set to remain below the replacement level; since 2012 the crude death rate has exceeded the crude birth rate every year. The number of people aged 65 and over will increase from an estimated 2.3m in 2020 to 2.6m by 2030 and 3.3m by 2050. The number of people of working age will decline from 6.8m to 6.2m and 4.7m over the same periods.
Transport links to neighbours should improve External conditions: Greece is geographically remote from the EU market, although less so since the EU's expansion to include Bulgaria and Romania in January 2007. Greece will continue with infrastructure projects to improve transport links with the southern Balkan states of Albania, Macedonia and Bulgaria (in part subsidised by the EU). Provided that the Balkan region can improve political and economic stability, better transport links with the countries to the north are expected to help to attract some investment from foreign companies wishing to establish a base in south-east Europe from a more established Western market. However, existing EU27 members are divided on the question of eastward enlargement, which has slowed progress and could encourage the countries of the western Balkans to seek other patrons, including China, Russia, Turkey and the UAE. We also believe that there remains a risk that Greece will leave the euro area over the long term as currency devaluation becomes the preferred method to restore competitiveness. However, even if Greece were to leave the euro area, we expect that it would remain a member of the EU.
Greek and EU relations with Turkey will also influence Greece's long-term economic prospects. Relations between Greece and Turkey had been improving since mid-1999, but took a turn for the worse in 2016-19 over the Cyprus question, and again in August 2020 over hydrocarbon exploration by Turkey in disputed areas of the Eastern Mediterranean. Relations are set to remain volatile and we do not expect progress in the dispute over Cyprus. The EU opened membership negotiations with Turkey in October 2005. Some large EU member states, such as Germany and France, stalled the talks on technical grounds. A deal over migration between the EU and Turkey in April 2016 was meant to revive the stalled accession negotiation process, but talks have remained in the doldrums. Our forecast is that Turkey will not join the EU as it is currently shaped. Even so, we expect that political tensions will have only a limited impact on broadly positive trade and investment relations between Greece and Turkey.
Political stability will be imperilled by public distrust of all political parties Institutions and policy trends: Greece has a well-established parliamentary democracy. However, the political system is prone to instability owing to government ineffectiveness and the erosion of public trust in the mainstream political parties. A renewed migration surge into Europe along the Balkan route as a result of war and state breakdown in the Middle East could potentially threaten social stability. Institutional effectiveness should improve moderately in 2020-50, but progress is likely to be constrained by pervasive corruption, political patronage and bureaucratic resistance to change.
We expect that red tape will be reduced moderately and that the tax system will become more efficient. Labour law has been changed to ease the hiring and firing of workers and to give priority to labour agreements at the company level. However, we expect that the adoption of structural reforms to boost competitiveness will be inconsistent and will make a difference only over the longer term. Public debt and the cost of supporting an ageing population will remain high, leaving little room for a substantial cut in the overall burden of taxes and social security contributions.
Long-term performance: We expect real GDP to grow at 2.5% per year on average in 2021-30 (3% per head). Over 2031-50 average annual GDP growth is forecast to be 1% (1.5% per head). Labour productivity growth is expected to average 2.4% per year over the entire long-term forecast period. Scope for a further rise in labour force participation rates will be reduced, and we expect a decline in the working-age population. We expect the labour force to shrink by an annual average of 0.2% in 2021-30, and by 1.3% per year in 2031-50, resulting in an annual average fall of 0.9% in 2021-50.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Climate change is predicted to have significant negative effects on the natural ecosystems of Greece and on many important economic sectors over the long term; for example, it will affect biodiversity, species and habitat, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, tourism, transport, activities in coastal areas, and the built environment in urban centres, mainly owing to increased temperature, drought, extreme weather events and rising sea levels. According to specific climate change studies pertaining to Greece, the effects will lead to reductions in productivity, capital losses and additional costs arising from damage repair. According to a study by the Bank of Greece (the central bank) in 2011, under an inaction ("business as usual") scenario, Greek GDP could fall by an annual 2% by 2050 and 6% by 2100. It states that the total cumulative cost to the Greek economy could reach about EUR700bn (at constant prices of 2008) by 2100. An updated study is due to be published in 2021. According to our long-term economic model, by 2050 climate change will subtract 3.4% from forecast real GDP.
There is thus a clear necessity for the adoption of mitigation and adaptation policies. For example, the tourism and shipping sectors are of vital importance for Greece. The focus is on "Blue Growth", which is a long-term strategy to support integrated sustainable growth in the marine and maritime sectors. The Mediterranean region, where Greece is situated, is bordered by more than 20 countries and a large part of the Mediterranean Sea remains outside national jurisdiction. As a result, co-operation on issues such as climate change and the environment is vital in order to manage maritime activities, tackle climate impacts, protect the marine environment and fight pollution in the Mediterranean region.
Greece adopted its first National Climate Change Programme in 1995; the second was adopted in 2002 and revised in 2007. All three iterations placed great emphasis on achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by changing the fuel mix to include a higher percentage of natural gas and renewable energy sources; improving energy efficiency and conservation in all sectors; making structural changes in agriculture and transport; reducing emissions in waste management; and expanding research and development efforts. In 2016 Greece adopted the National Strategy for Adapting to Climate Change (ESPKA) through Law 4414/2016, which sets out general objectives, guidelines and means of implementation. According to the strategy, mitigation policies and adaptation should be adopted in all fields, but especially in those of energy, clean technology, industry, biodiversity, agriculture, tourism and transport. The National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) published in December 2019 sets out a detailed roadmap regarding the attainment of specific energy and climate objectives by 2030. Its core objective is a reduction of GHG emissions of more than 42% by 2030 compared with emissions in 1990 and more than 56% compared with 2005, which is more ambitious than core EU targets. The Ministry of Environment and Energy is responsible for identifying potential climate change impacts, planning and co-ordinating adaptation measures and policies, and preparing a national adaptation strategy
Demographic and productivity headwinds The UN's long-term population projections for Greece, which The Economist Intelligence Unit uses in its long-term growth forecasts, assume a decline in the overall population from an estimated 10.5m in 2020 to 9.9m in 2030 and 9m in 2050. Falling fertility rates and continued outward emigration will result in a rapidly shrinking and ageing population. Greece's working-age population is projected to fall from an estimated 6.7m in 2020 to 6.2m in 2030 and 4.7m in 2050; that is a decline of 29.5% over the 2021-50 period. This is one of the steepest declines in the euro area. We forecast an only slightly slower decline in the labour force, of 27%, from 4.6m in 2020 to 3.5m in 2050; this assumes an increase in the labour participation rate in the coming decades as the retirement age is raised and more women enter the labour force.
Such adverse demographic projections would imply a severely negative effect on long-term real GDP growth rates. This is especially worrying given Greece's poor historical track record when it comes to productivity growth. To achieve even the modest average annual long-term real GDP growth rate of 1.5% that we forecast for 2021-50 will require significant improvements in employment, labour participation and productivity growth rates, which Greece has not achieved in recent decades. Over the past 45 years Greece's total factor productivity growth averaged 0.2% per year, and since joining the euro zone in 2001 it has turned negative.
A rebound in investment is likely given the low levels to which it has sunk over the past decade and a potential boost from EU recovery funds, but this positive effect will not persist over decades. Once the capital stock is replenished, the boost to growth will dissipate and the negative effects of poor demographics and productivity will reassert themselves. The emphasis must therefore be on policies to raise employment rates and boost total factor productivity to avert the disaster of negative average growth rates over the long term. However, the empirical evidence suggests that even the most comprehensive structural reform programme aimed at transforming productivity and the labour market may not deliver the sort of pay-off in terms of growth that is needed.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2016-20) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2021-25). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2016-20. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2021-25 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2016-20 ranges are then used to derive 2021-25 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2021-25, not to the likely situation in 2025 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2018 or 2023). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - The president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is facing a challenging period for the remainder of his term, which ends in 2024. This includes a possible challenge for the leadership of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) in December 2022 in the absence of an economic rebound.
- As South Africa emerges from the global coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the economic damage, alongside the need for urgent action, will help to build support within the ANC for the president's reformist agenda, albeit reluctantly in some cases. The fightback against corruption is also gaining momentum: the former president, Jacob Zuma, faces a full trial on long-standing corruption charges in May. A post-pandemic recovery plan will focus on a vaccine rollout starting in the second quarter, as well as on infrastructure investment (led by the private sector), public works programmes to create jobs and measures to combat shortages of electricity. Fiscal constraints point to an increased reliance on public-private partnerships to drive forward key projects.
- Following a severe recession in 2020, with real GDP shrinking by 7% because of the pandemic, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a modest recovery to 2% (revised from 1.8%) in 2021. The uplift reflects stronger commodity prices and another bumper harvest, but power supply constraints, still-weak tourism and jobs lost to the pandemic will preclude a more rapid rebound. We envisage growth quickening to an average of 2.7% a year in 2022-25, underpinned by structural reforms, but unemployment will continue to weigh on aggregate demand.
- We estimate that the budget deficit will have reached a peacetime record of 14.6% of GDP in fiscal year 2020/21 (April-March). The shortfall will retreat in 2022-25, but debt risks remain elevated. Cumulative interest-rate cuts in 2020 reduced the benchmark rate to 3.5%, providing relief to borrowers. We expect the next move to be a small rise in late 2021 or early 2022.
- After easing to a multi-year low of 3.2% in 2020, average inflation will rise to 3.7% in 2021, owing to costlier oil and electricity, but weak demand will keep price growth subdued. Inflation will quicken to 4.6% a year on average in 2022-25 as economic growth stages a gradual post-pandemic recovery.
- A rare current-account surplus in 2020 (as imports fell faster than exports) will revert to a deficit in 2021-25. The merchandise trade surplus will persist, but it will be offset by a much larger deficit on non-merchandise (invisible) trade.

- South Africa's business environment score improves for 2021-25, although its global ranking drops by one and its regional ranking is unchanged from 2016-20. Market opportunity and infrastructure gains will be partly offset by deteriorations in macroeconomic stability and taxation.

Country forecast overview: South Africa's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: A post-pandemic investment drive, focused on infrastructure, facilitates public-private partnerships. Challenges include tighter competition laws and stricter black economic empowerment (BEE) rules.
2023-25: Expropriation without compensation, to speed up land reform, applies in limited circumstances only, reducing the threat to property rights. Investment incentives in selected industries (such as automotive manufacturing) remain in place.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: A reworked mining charter offers some concessions to business. A new foreign investment law limits access to international arbitration by giving local courts the primary responsibility for handling disputes.
2023-25: The government continues to encourage foreign investment and public-private partnerships, but resists the full privatisation of state assets in most cases.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: The government implements a further relaxation of capital controls on outward investment and other flows.
2023-25: Progress towards regional economic integration in Southern Africa makes some advances, but barriers persist.
Taxes 2021-22: Despite tough fiscal conditions, the government avoids major tax increases to shield households and firms. The corporation tax is trimmed to 27% (from 28%) in 2022.
2023-25: Efforts to streamline and modernise the tax system and expand the tax base continue.
Financing 2021-22: Cuts in the benchmark interest rate and other liquidity-boosting measures help to support banks and firms during the pandemic. Local banks remain sound and a major source of corporate financing, despite profits being squeezed.
2023-25: The continued independence of the South African Reserve Bank (the central bank) helps to preserve financial system stability. Interest rates edge higher. The proposed nationalisation of the central bank is symbolic.
The labour market 2021-22: Pandemic-induced job losses oblige trade unions to accept a mild relaxation of currently inflexible labour laws.
2023-25: The labour market remains tough, owing to skills shortages and BEE targets.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Investment in transport and electricity, led in many cases by private firms, boosts capacity.
2023-25: Private-sector-led investment in renewable energy gathers momentum under the government's long-term energy plan, adding diversity to power supplies and cutting reliance on coal. Rising power tariffs drive energy efficiency.
Technological readiness 2021-22: The rollout of domestic fibre-optic cables boosts capacity and cuts costs. Investment in digital technology gathers momentum, including in cloud computing and high-end data analysis. The allocation of new spectrum boosts capacity.
2023-25: Work advances on the Square Kilometre Array-a powerful radio telescope with multinational support-giving a wider boost to science and to information and communications technology.

Background: South Africa became a full democracy in 1994, when it first held all-race elections. The African National Congress (ANC) won, and has dominated all subsequent elections-in 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019. However, support ebbed steadily from a peak of nearly 70% in 2004, to 62.1% in 2014 and 57.5% in May 2019. The ANC feared a worse result in May 2019, but the installation of Cyril Ramaphosa as president in February 2018, replacing the scandal-tainted Jacob Zuma, provided a mild bounce. Mr Ramaphosa will now serve a full five-year term and will be eligible for a second term.
Political structure: South Africa is a constitutional democracy with a bicameral parliament and a president elected by parliament. The constitution is the supreme law. The National Assembly is elected by proportional representation; the National Council of the Provinces consists of indirectly elected representatives of the nine provinces. The judiciary is independent and includes an 11-member Constitutional Court. The constitution provides for an independent corruption watchdog-the Public Protector-and commissions on human rights, gender equality and restitution of land rights.
Policy issues: The main policy focus in 2021-25 will be to facilitate recovery from a severe recession in 2020, caused by the damaging impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The need to boost post-pandemic growth will allow Mr Ramaphosa to push ahead more forcefully with his reformist agenda. An economic recovery and reconstruction plan, devised in consultation with business and labour unions, will focus on investment in critical infrastructure, led by the private sector, alongside a public works programme to create jobs. Tackling power shortages by commissioning new capacity from independent power producers, and by restructuring Eskom, the highly-indebted electricity parastatal, is another key objective. Fiscal constraints point to greater reliance on public-private partnerships, despite resistance from vested interests. A new draft expropriation bill sets clear limits on when compensation is not payable, thus diminishing the threat to property rights and investor confidence. Challenges include skills shortages, stricter competition laws and the risk of strikes.
Taxation: Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a flat rate of 15%-after a rise from 14% on April 1st 2018-although some essentials are zero-rated. Corporation tax (of 28%), income tax and VAT were left unchanged in the 2021/22 budget, which was largely tax-neutral. Some tax concessions are available, including in special economic zones.
Foreign trade: South Africa has a relatively open economy, with foreign trade (imports plus exports) accounting for about 52% of GDP. China, the EU, the US and Japan are among its largest trading partners. Trade with the rest of Africa has become progressively more important, and it is the only region with which South Africa has a consistent trade surplus.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability Recovery from the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic will confront South Africa with unparalleled challenges, but the growing authority of the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has positive implications for political stability and economic reform. Since being elected for a five-year term in May 2019 Mr Ramaphosa has struggled to unite the disparate factions of the ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC), behind a reformist agenda, but a severe recession in 2020, accompanied by heavy job losses and rising poverty, is changing the political dynamic. After several years of policy fudges to appease powerful interest groups (such as labour unions), the urgent need for action to repair the economy-and working more closely with the private sector-is boosting the president's influence and sidelining his critics.
The two main sources of resistance to Mr Ramaphosa within the ANC will be left-wing interventionists, including labour unions-which will remain wedded to a strong state role in the economy-and the so-called radical transformation movement that emerged during the presidency of Jacob Zuma (2009-18), which is blamed for facilitating corruption and patronage under the guise of black economic empowerment. The left, although still clamouring for wage rises, is now resigned to a more prominent role for the private sector and the restructuring of dysfunctional parastatal firms, in view of the state's financial and technical capacity constraints. Heavy job losses will inevitably weaken trade unions' influence in both the private and the public sectors, obliging them to compromise in many cases. The president's economic recovery package, devised with business and labour input, combines an infrastructure investment plan-to be led by the private sector-with a major job-creating public works programme to provide temporary relief to the unemployed.
Resistance from the radical transformation faction will fade, given an escalating crackdown on corruption and the rising prospect of Mr Zuma being convicted on graft charges dating from before his presidency: a full trial will start in May. Mr Zuma could also be jailed for defying a Constitutional Court order to appear before a judge-led corruption inquiry on February 15th. A pending corruption trial facing the ANC's secretary-general, Ace Magashule-one of Mr Zuma's allies-now scheduled for August, will further weaken the radical transformation faction, especially if Mr Magashule is suspended from his post in line with party policy. A conviction in 2021 for Mr Zuma, who presided over institutional weakening during his tenure, would symbolise a fightback against impunity. Mr Ramaphosa-who The Economist Intelligence Unit views as South Africa's best leadership option-will continue to face political obstacles and will act cautiously, but the stronger his position becomes, the better the outlook for much-needed economic reforms.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch The next major political event is the ANC's five-yearly National General Council (NGC)-a policy implementation review-which will give a clearer indication of the balance of forces in the party and the extent of Mr Ramaphosa's control. After being delayed by more than a year by the pandemic, the NGC's timing is still uncertain, although we expect it to take place in advance of the next municipal elections, which are scheduled to be held during an August-October 2021 window. The nationwide ballot will give voters the first chance to judge the government's pandemic response and will be a test of Mr Ramaphosa's and the ANC's popularity. A vote share for the ANC in 2021 of less than the 57.5% won in 2019 would be a setback for Mr Ramaphosa, heralding a potential challenge by radical forces for the ANC leadership in December 2022; a share above 57.5% would help to cement the president's position. We expect the ANC, under Mr Ramaphosa, to retain power at the next general election (in 2024), but with reduced electoral support. The implementation of a new Political Party Funding Act in April 2021 will strengthen transparency.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations South Africa-the most advanced economy in Africa and a major business hub-will remain deeply engaged in the continent, particularly in Southern and East Africa. Despite a challenging environment, South Africa will continue to attract international companies, including from the US, Europe and Asia, owing to strong institutions, sound banks and its role as continental gateway. South Africa's commercial involvement in other African markets will remain broad-based, covering mining, banking, telecommunications, retail and hospitality. The pandemic is causing temporary disruption to regional relations because of border closures and flight bans, aggravated by a second wave of infections, but regional access for South Africa-based firms will improve in 2021, helped by vaccine rollouts.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends The main policy focus in 2021-25 will be facilitating recovery from a severe recession in 2020, stemming from the pandemic's impact on economic activity and health. Containment measures have been progressively loosened since a strict initial lockdown was imposed in April 2020-including a move to level one, the most relaxed, on March 1st-but the cost of the pandemic in terms of lost jobs and income remains heavy. A second wave of infections, driven by a new, more transmissible variant of the virus, led to more cases and deaths in December/January than during the first peak in July/August 2020, but the figures retreated again in February. An initial vaccine rollout in March will gather pace during the second quarter of 2021, but widespread immunisation is unlikely in South Africa until July-December, given supply shortages and logistical challenges, which increases the risk of a third wave of Covid-19.
The government will attempt to engineer a rebound in growth in 2021-25, via targeted measures and deeper structural reforms, although the scope for additional monetary and fiscal intervention is limited. With the benchmark interest rate at a record low of 3.5%, there is little room for further cuts, and several years of heavy spending and rising budget deficits preclude a broad-based fiscal stimulus. Even before the pandemic South Africa was trapped in a low-growth trajectory, not for the want of pro-growth plans, but because of policy fudges between left-wing and pro-business factions and weak implementation. The pandemic, by exposing underlying weaknesses (such as widespread poverty and inequality) and by highlighting the need for urgent action, should be a catalyst for deeper and more rapid structural reforms, including a greater role for the private sector.
Devised in consultation with business and organised labour, an economic recovery and reconstruction plan will focus on job creation-via large-scale public works programmes-and infrastructure investment. The plan aims to channel R100bn (US$6.8bn) over ten years into an infrastructure fund with the aim of attracting a ten times greater sum from the private sector via public-private partnerships. Projects already identified include housing and network infrastructure. Restoring energy security by adding new capacity (mostly solar and wind) from independent power producers is a key target, as is the planned auction of new broadband spectrum in 2021, which will boost communication and digitisation. Restructuring dysfunctional parastatal firms is another central priority. Implementation remains a challenge, but the political will to act is now stronger. Commitments to the IMF in return for a rapid financing instrument (RFI) in July 2020 will add impetus to reforms in the face of resistance from vested interests. We expect economic policy to support medium-term growth momentum and help the country to emerge from secular stagnation.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy The budget for fiscal year 2021/22 (April-March), unveiled in February, under-scores the severe impact of the pandemic on revenue. The Treasury expects the deficit in 2020/21 to hit a peacetime record of 14% of GDP, although this is lower than the 15.7% of GDP shortfall predicted in last October's medium-term budget policy statement (MTBPS), helped by a revenue boost from a recent commodity price upswing. The revenue gain will more than offset higher outlays on health and social welfare in 2020/21, and means that planned tax hikes in 2021/22 are now on hold and that a vaccine rollout costing R8.2bn (US$550m) is fully funded. The combination of stronger revenue-aided by an overhaul of the South African Revenue Service-alongside spending curbs, especially on public-sector wages, will see the deficit shrink during the forecast period. We expect the shortfall, as a percentage of GDP, to ebb to 9.2% in 2021/22 and 7.4% in 2022/23, before easing to 3.3% in 2025/26. The biggest risk to fiscal consolidation is a fightback by labour unions against wage restraint via a combination of legal action, political pressure and possible strikes.
The massive deficit in 2020/21 pushed up public debt to 80% of GDP (from 63.3% of GDP in 2019/20), but the Treasury now expects the burden to rise more slowly, peaking at 88.9% of GDP in 2025/26, compared with 95.3% of GDP in the MTBPS. Speedier fiscal consolidation reduces South Africa's risk of debt distress, as does its heavy reliance on deep and liquid domestic capital markets to finance most of the budget shortfalls, but debt-servicing costs will continue rising and there is limited scope for slippage on either the spending or the revenue fronts. A failure to meet debt targets could oblige South Africa to undertake a formal IMF programme with strict conditions attached.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy Policy accommodation during the 2020 pandemic crisis will give way to a normalisation process later in 2021, with interest rates edging higher as the economy begins to recover. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB, the central bank) cut the benchmark interest rate (repo rate) five times in 2020-most recently in July-by a cumulative 300 basis points to 3.5%, to help to shield the economy from the pandemic. However, the rate has since remained on hold, reflecting limited scope for additional loosening. We expect the SARB to maintain its current stance throughout most of 2021, but the expected resumption of real GDP growth, and a mild inflation upswing, point to a small rate rise in either late 2021 or early 2022. Additional small increases will follow in 2023-25, broadly tracking US trends.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth South Africa faces serious economic challenges because of ongoing pandemic-related disruptions, including containment measures, which caused a deep recession in 2020, with real GDP shrinking by 7%, in line with our previous estimate of 7.1%. Given weak pre-pandemic growth, the recession provisionally wiped out several years of economic expansion and job creation, putting severe pressure on household, corporate and government finances. Growth will resume in 2021, underpinned by a global rebound and a commodity price upswing, which will support the key mining sector and which, combined with the prospect of a second consecutive bumper harvest, a tax-neutral budget and signs of a rebound in investment and construction, have prompted us to revise up our real GDP forecast for 2021 to 2% (from 1.8%). The pace of recovery will be held back by several domestic constraints, including the winding down of fiscal stimulus measures and enduring damage to the productive sector and employment caused by the recession. A probable year-on-year contraction in real GPD in January-March because of the largely pre-pandemic baseline will also curb growth in 2021. Looser restrictions and vaccine rollout will support the economy in the second quarter, but a third wave of Covid-19 remains a risk in the third quarter.
A pending vaccination programme will boost economic activity and confidence, but the rollout will be slow initially, before gathering pace in the second half of the year, which leaves the possible risk of a third wave of infection during the southern hemisphere winter (June-August). A major challenge in 2021 will be a shortage of electricity, which places an upper limit on the growth rebound. The recession and lower demand in 2020 spared South Africa from more frequent and heavier load-shedding (power rationing), but the constraint will persist ahead of the planned commissioning of new generating capacity in mid-2022. The phased reopening of borders will provide some impetus, but pandemic risks will keep international tourism and the hospitality sector in the doldrums. Global risks include an escalation of US-China tensions.
Prospects for 2022 are slightly brighter; we expect growth to quicken to 2.2%, helped by a relaxation of power-supply constraints and by stronger private investment in response to favourable policy initiatives. Factors weighing on domestic growth will include a slowdown in global growth (after an initial rebound in 2021), alongside fragile tourism and elevated unemployment. We expect growth to strengthen to 2.9% a year on average in 2023-25, underpinned by long-delayed reforms (such as parastatal restructuring) and the spread of digital technology, but the global backdrop will remain subdued in terms of economic growth and trade flows.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation After dipping to a multi-year low of 3.2% in 2020 owing to recession, cheaper imported oil and a bumper food harvest, inflation will edge up to 3.7% in 2021, remaining comfortably within the SARB's 3-6% target range. The main sources of inflation in 2021 will be higher oil prices and costlier electricity tariffs, although favourable rainfall to date in the 2020/21 season and the prospect of a second consecutive bumper harvest will offset higher global food prices. Other factors curbing inflation are a much slower pace of rand depreciation in 2021, weak aggregate demand (due to unemployment and income losses), spare industrial capacity and strong retail competition. We expect inflation to quicken to an average of 4.6% a year in 2022-25, spurred by a modest revival in GDP growth, but to stay within the SARB's target range, temporary breaches aside.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates The rand appreciated to R14.75:US$1 in February (from R15.13:US$1 in January), its strongest level for 13 months, supported by external factors, including liquidity injections in wealthier countries, which are buoying emerging-market currencies. The US election outcome, expectations of a bigger US stimulus package, higher commodity prices and global vaccine rollouts reinforce the trend. We expect the rand to slide from February's level, as an ongoing recession and a wide fiscal deficit put pressure on the currency, but the pace of depreciation in 2021 will be much slower than in 2020, when the rand weakened by 14% to R16.46:US$1. Our current forecast sees the rand drifting to US$16.53:US$1 in 2021, although the currency, being widely traded, will remain volatile, often experiencing large daily movements in response to shifting sentiment. South Africa's modest external debt stock and healthy foreign-exchange reserves offer some protection. Gradual depreciation will see the rand slide to R17.41:US$1 in 2022, before a further drift to R18.71:US$1 in 2025.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector South Africa provisionally recorded a rare current-account surplus in 2020, of 1.3% of GDP, as exports fell much less sharply than imports, generating a large surplus on merchandise trade that more than offset the perennial deficit on invisible trade (which comprises services, trade and current transfers). We expect the current account to move back into deficit in 2021 as imports recover faster than exports, trimming the trade surplus. Robust demand and prices for gold and platinum-group metals and China's return to near normality will boost exports, but higher oil prices and the resumption of real GDP growth will buoy imports by a larger margin. We forecast that the current-account deficit as a proportion of GDP will widen from 1.2% in 2021 and 2.3% in 2022. Trade flows will move closer to pre-pandemic levels in 2023-25, leading to a slightly wider current-account deficit (of 2.4% of GDP a year on average), as the invisible trade shortfall-led by income payments to foreign investors and transfers to fellow members of the Southern African Customs Union-offsets the surplus in goods. South Africa will benefit from preferential access to the US under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (ahead of its scheduled expiry in 2025) and from the gradual rollout of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area. A persistent current-account deficit implies continued reliance on foreign financial inflows, including portfolio and direct investment, to finance the shortfall.

Full text: - Despite Venezuela's socioeconomic collapse and the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, to retain power throughout the 2021-25 forecast period. Mr Maduro's position will be supported primarily by his grip over a complex security apparatus and the opposition's lack of de facto power. On this basis, we expect continued deterioration of the economy, sustained outward migration, and a poorer and more violent Venezuela. Despite US sanctions (and their impact on oil production), the Maduro regime has managed internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through its strict control over the security forces.
- The scale of the socioeconomic collapse and the elevated level of political instability will ensure that the Maduro regime continues to be challenged both economically and politically. In particular, there is a significant risk of regime change stemming from a possible breakdown in the patronage system that sustains the security forces' support of the regime. Under our baseline forecast, we assume that Mr Maduro will avoid this, as oil revenue should pick up from a trough in 2020. However, there are substantial risks to this assumption, given the scale of operational difficulties and the lack of incentives for investment in the Venezuelan oil industry.
- De facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding. Concurrently, the government has taken measures that have allowed the official exchange rate to float. These measures have to date aided price stability and therefore increased the availability of some basic goods. However, the measures are not a product of economic orthodoxy, but of policy decisions to ensure the regime's survival. We do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that will be required to resolve Venezuela's economic crisis within the forecast period.

- Venezuela ranks 82nd of 82 countries in the global business environment rankings for 2021-25, having been in 80th place in the 2016-20 historical period, as the economic crisis deepens despite minor improvements. Reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment are unlikely.

Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Expansion of interventionist measures, including price controls. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and continue to undermine free competition.
2023-25: Contract rights remain weak, and red tape and ad hoc interventionism continue.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Most attempts to attract investment prove unsuccessful, owing to political and economic instability.
2023-25: Investment flows remain low amid ongoing economic volatility. Intellectual property protection and private property rights deteriorate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Currency controls are weakened, but access to foreign currency remains limited.
2023-25: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, and de facto dollarisation advances. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves as oil prices rise, albeit slowly.
Taxes 2021-22: Risk of further unrest and political instability reduces probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major rise in public spending.
2023-25: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2021-22: Inflation remains high and concerns surrounding economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2023-25: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2021-22: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Past emigration of skilled labour aggravates skills shortages.
2023-25: Labour-market rigidities persist despite some increase in flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Underinvestment in water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts.
2023-25: Investors remain highly cautious about committing to long-term capital projects. Infrastructure deteriorates even further.
Technological readiness 2021-22: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment, but with little interest.
2023-25: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to restrict internet and mobile coverage.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013 proved unsuccessful. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his own popularity plummet as his macroeconomic mismanagement, combined with strict sanctions on trade from the US, has plunged the country into a severe economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature to be in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly. In December 2020 the PSUV and its allies regained control of the legislature in an election that was widely regarded as rigged.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of PDVSA (the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country) has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports, and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$10.2bn in 2019 as a long-term decline in oil exports deepened. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the trade account deteriorated further in 2020, shifting to a deficit of US$995m

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV, the Chavistas), to remain in power throughout the 2021-25 forecast period, despite its failure to stem a long-running socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis. A number of factors underpin our forecast; particularly significant is the regime's strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces. This control, which depends on a patronage system that rewards the loyalty of high-ranking officials, will allow the regime to manage internal dissent.
Following a sham legislative election in December 2020, in which the Chavistas retook control of the National Assembly, the regime enjoys virtually unchecked control over all the levers of power. Meanwhile, the domestic opposition, led by Juan Guaidó (the former head of the legislature and self-declared interim president), has been left scrambling without a clear path forward. Its decision to boycott the December election has left it without a voice in any major government institution. Before it lost control of the National Assembly, the opposition moved to unilaterally extend its mandate by one year. However, with many lawmakers abstaining from the vote out of fear of reprisals from the Maduro regime, and with key international players like the EU no longer recognising Mr Guaidó as the interim president (but rather as the main opposition leader), the opposition's attempt to extend its mandate lacks clear support and legitimacy.
In practice, the fallout from the election changes little in terms of policymaking; Mr Maduro has long used the executive's sweeping powers, as well as his influence over the highly politicised judiciary, to approve his policy agenda. However, retaking control of the National Assembly is significant insofar as it all but erases any threat that the Guaidó-led opposition might pose to Mr Maduro.
There is, nonetheless, a high degree of risk attached to our forecast that Mr Maduro will remain in power. The uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease, diminished oil rents-resulting from severe mismanagement of the sector, and more recently from US sanctions and low international oil prices-and persistent goods shortages all present hefty challenges to the survival of the regime. In our view, there are three main paths to a change of government: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We believe that the prospect of military action by the US or Colombia is very low. Notwithstanding efforts by the US to increase multilateral engagement, a negotiated transition would also be difficult, as trust issues between the two sides are insurmountable. Bearing this in mind, we believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The regime's main weakness is the fragility of its internal finances. Its patronage system is crucial for sustaining its security apparatus and resisting social unrest. Low, albeit rising, oil prices, US sanctions and an extremely poor macroeconomic environment will limit the country's ability to draw in US dollar finance. The regime will continue to benefit from funds from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities, but a lack of hard currency could prove fatal to the patronage system, and will test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks and control over the security apparatus. The regime's liquidity problems-along with a deepening socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis-could prompt putsch attempts in the near term.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch Venezuela held legislative elections in December 2020 to select the 277 members of the unicameral National Assembly. The vote, which was boycotted by most opposition parties, was widely regarded as being neither free nor fair. The results were therefore unsurprising; the Gran Polo Patriótico, an electoral alliance dominated by the PSUV, won an overwhelming supermajority of 256 seats in the legislature.
Next on the electoral calendar are regional elections (to elect governors and state legislative assemblies), due by end-2021, followed by local elections (to elect mayors and councillors) in 2022. However, we now believe that local elections will be brought forward to 2021, following a move in early March by lawmakers to repeal the law that regularises the constitutional terms of state and local governments. In a context where the PSUV already controls more than 85% of state governments and municipal councils, the political benefits of consolidating power at the sub-national level will be modest. Consequently, we believe that the regime will also endeavour to use negotiations over electoral conditions as a step towards gaining international legitimacy and some degree of sanctions relief. At present, we remain sceptical that the regime will acquiesce to conditions that would ensure a level playing field, and we consider that prospects for sanctions relief are dim.
Against this backdrop, the key question for the opposition will be whether to participate in elections, with the game rigged against it. We believe that some factions are likely to participate, even under unfair conditions, to make inroads into a political system from which they have been shut out. However, any gains will be modest and will not alter the fundamental balance of power.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations The Maduro regime's main foreign policy challenge will centre on managing its combative ties with the US. The administration led by the former US president, Donald Trump (2017-21), instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions as part of a "maximum pressure" campaign designed to undermine the regime's finances (and therefore its patronage system) in order to force Mr Maduro to hold free and fair elections. Although the aggressive sanctions policy did not produce its intended outcome, it did accelerate the decline of Venezuela's oil industry. Mr Maduro will look to reset ties with the US under the new president, Joe Biden, but we expect little progress. US policy towards Venezuela has bipartisan support in that country, and Mr Biden is unlikely to provide significant sanctions relief absent major political compromises and commitments to democratic reforms from the Maduro regime (which remain highly improbable). Any changes to sanctions policy by the US would therefore be only on humanitarian grounds, aimed at improving the lives of the poorest Venezuelans. For instance, we expect the Biden administration to reverse course on the recently instated sanctions on crude-for-diesel swaps, which are largely used by the regime to shore up diesel supplies for power generation, agricultural activity, water pumps and public transport.
Iran recently became Mr Maduro's main international backer. In 2020 Iran sent more than 2.5m barrels of petrol to Venezuela (in exchange for gold shipments) to alleviate the country's severe gasoline shortages. An additional 677,000 barrels have already been sent in the year to date (mostly in exchange for jet fuel).
Venezuela's other major allies, including Russia and China, seem unwilling to provide the financing-amounting to tens of billions of US dollars per year-required to stabilise the economy and secure the long-term future of PDVSA (the state oil company). Mr Maduro has openly courted both countries, but has had little success in securing finance for investment.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends The Maduro regime's immediate policy priorities will be to contain the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak and to halt a long-running economic collapse. In order to address the community spread of the coronavirus, in January the regime reintroduced the "Fórmula 7+7 Plus" strategy, which involves alternating between a week of tighter restrictions (when non-essential shops and services are closed) and a week of more relaxed restrictions (when those businesses may open). However, this approach will not prevent Venezuela's decrepit medical infrastructure from being overwhelmed. Concurrently, efforts by the regime to procure vaccines are making little headway. So far, Venezuela has only received some 200,000 doses of the Sputnik V vaccine from Russia. Mr Maduro says that a total of 10m Sputnik V doses will arrive this year, but Russian authorities have not confirmed a purchase agreement. The government also hopes to obtain 1.4m-2.4m vaccine doses through the WHO-led COVAX Facility, but a lack of funding, along with the politicisation of vaccine distribution, is hindering procurement. Against this backdrop, we do not expect that enough doses of the vaccine will be distributed to have a significant impact on local transmission until 2023.
Addressing the long-running economic decline will be a similarly difficult task. Mr Maduro will continue a process of gradual economic liberalisation in order to draw in private investment. In October 2020 the regime promulgated an anti-blockade law, which gives the executive branch the unchecked authority to sign confidential new deals with private firms and countries (in a bid to skirt international sanctions). In November the regime used the law to sell Agropatria, a state-owned agricultural firm, to Grupo Agrollano, a private company of unknown origin. We expect that the regime will similarly seek to reprivatise a number of other businesses that had been expropriated by Mr Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chávez (1999-2013), but were run aground by cronyism and mismanagement. The regime will also encourage greater private-sector participation in the oil industry, but it will refrain from outright privatisation of PDVSA. These efforts, however, are unlikely to yield significant results; even assuming that the regime is able to sidestep financial sanctions, it will struggle to attract new investment, given the abysmal business environment and the lack of confidence in the rule of law.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy The authorities have not published complete data on fiscal accounts since 2011. However, we expect that a high level of inefficient current expenditure, combined with an extremely weak revenue intake, will keep the budget deficit wide and the public debt/GDP ratio astronomical throughout the forecast period. The sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will curb government spending. The regime relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Money printing will continue to finance the government's deficits in 2021-25. The sovereign is in arrears on virtually all of its interest and principal repayments, and we do not expect any debt restructuring in 2021-25. Moreover, the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing-mainly PDVSA-issued debt and development funds from China-understates the true size of total public liabilities.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy Monetary policy will remain subservient to fiscal policy, as the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) continues to print money to finance the government's gaping budget deficits. The BCV has, in recent years, taken steps to control growth of monetary aggregates. For instance, in early 2019 it lifted the cash reserve ratio (CRR) to 100%; although it has relaxed the CRR slightly since that peak, as at January it remained at an extremely high 85%. Moreover, far from taming inflation, these measures have only led to the complete destruction of private-sector credit; in January the stock of real private-sector credit was less than 1% of what it was four years ago.
These factors have accelerated the use of US dollars in the economy. According to private-sector estimates, two-thirds of all financial transactions are now made in US dollars. This is likely to rise further, following Mr Maduro's January announcement that banks would be authorised to expand the use of foreign-currency bank accounts. The regime has even allowed private companies to issue debt in hard currency in order to raise finance; in November 2020, Ron Santa Teresa became the first company in more than two decades to issue dollar-denominated bonds (worth US$300,000) on the Caracas Stock Exchange. Although progress will be gradual, we believe that Venezuela is ultimately headed towards overall de facto dollarisation.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 31% in 2020 (and a cumulative contraction of almost 77% since 2013), we forecast an additional 3.7% decline in GDP in 2021. GDP is now strongly correlated with oil production. Having plummeted to an average of 500,000 barrels/day in 2020-its lowest level in several decades-crude production should stabilise in 2021 as global energy demand starts to recover. PDVSA's ability to ramp up oil production more significantly will be limited, given the absence of any active oil rigs in the country. Moreover, prospects for investment are bleak: at present, Venezuela's average break-even price is about US$15-20/barrel. However, US sanctions on the regime raise the risks involved in dealing with Venezuela, forcing the country to offer a hefty discount on its crude. This means that, at current market prices, Venezuela is making only a limited profit (its oil basket traded at an estimated US$37/b in January). That said, there are some upside risks to our assumptions. Oil prices are currently on the rise, giving potential buyers stronger incentives to find ways around US sanctions. Moreover, even in the absence of active rigs, it is possible that PDVSA could extract more crude than we anticipate from existing oil wells. For its part, the non-oil economy will see little improvement, especially as an uncontrolled pandemic limits prospects for services activities.
In 2022 we expect economic growth to return on the back of a surge in oil prices. Despite serious operational problems (such as difficulties in obtaining equipment for repairs and finding qualified staff) and a limited pool of suitable buyers of Venezuelan crude, oil output will recover partially in the medium term, as producers adapt to post-sanctions export markets. Furthermore, relative macroeconomic stability-driven primarily by an expansion of dollarisation-will allow the non-oil economy to recover marginally in the medium term. Nonetheless, we assume that Venezuela's GDP (in real terms) will be only about half of its 2018 level, even in 2025.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation A severely reduced domestic goods supply, constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits will impede the disinflationary process in 2021-25. The regime has shown little inclination to take on the fiscal and macroeconomic reforms that would address the root causes of inflation. It has, however, lent its support to an ongoing process of de facto dollarisation, which will help to ease price pressures over time.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates Hyperinflation will sustain bolívar depreciation in 2021. Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency redenomination (as in March 2018) or a new currency is a strong possibility. Even though a number of currency regulations officially remain on the books, the regime has largely stopped enforcing them in its recent embrace of dollarisation. Although a black market for US dollars continues to operate, the premium is modest compared with previous years. On March 4th the black-market exchange rate stood at BsS1,900,753:US$1, only marginally above the official exchange rate of BsS1,874,605:US$1.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector Balance-of-payments pressures will remain severe throughout the forecast period, contributing to goods shortages and economic inequities. According to the BCV, foreign reserves stood at US$6.3bn in February-their lowest level in three decades. The steep decline in reserves, which has been several years in the making, reflects poor policymaking and a lack of economic diversification in the country's external sector.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect reserves to rise modestly over the forecast period, reaching US$7.7bn by end-2025. We expect this result to be driven entirely by trends on the current account, as Venezuela's access to foreign capital will remain extremely limited. We expect the current-account balance to shift from an estimated deficit of 3.4% of GDP in 2020 to a surplus of 1.5% of GDP in 2021. Thereafter, it will remain in surplus, averaging 1.8% of GDP in 2022-25. Our forecast rests on the assumption that export earnings will pick up from a nadir in 2020, as international oil prices recover and the country steps up trade with new markets in Asia. We also expect that workers' remittances from abroad will play a crucial role in propping up the current-account balance, as Venezuelan emigrants are gradually absorbed into the labour markets in their host countries.

Full text: - The tenure of the president, Muhammadu Buhari, will last until 2023 and be blemished by a decline in living standards caused by recession in 2020, a rise in unemployment and (paradoxically) high, policy-induced inflation.
- The government intends to vaccinate 40% of the population against the coronavirus by end-2021. In reality, completion of a vaccine rollout could take years, with tight global supply and new variants complicating the process.
- Owing to the decline in living standards under Mr Buhari, whose tenure has been marked by two recessions, as well as frustrations over pervasive insecurity and poor governance, The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) will win the 2023 election.
- We expect some reregulation of electricity pricing under a PDP government. This would be bad news for the power sector, but we do not expect a return to distortive pricing in the petroleum sector.
- A current-account deficit will continue to exert pressure on the multiple-exchange-rate regime in 2021 and force another devaluation of the official rate. Foreign-exchange supply is then expected to improve, allowing the market to stabilise in 2022-24. As oil prices dip in 2025 another devaluation is expected.
- Healthcare and capital spending will result in another substantial fiscal deficit by Nigerian standards. The shortfall will then broadly and gently narrow as external conditions improve, the domestic economy picks up and revenue rises over 2022-24. Decreasing oil prices in 2025 will again widen the deficit.
- Given a crippling infrastructure deficit, high inflation, instability in crucial agricultural regions and high unemployment, we expect growth of just 1.1% in 2021. Only when the exchange rate and inflation stabilise will there be a more meaningful recovery.
- Inflation will stay high in 2021 as devaluation of the naira, price deregulation, instability in agricultural growing areas, monetary loosening and exchange-rate restrictions for staple imports feed into consumer prices. Monetary tightening to tackle the issue is expected to start from 2022.
- We expect a current-account deficit for a third consecutive year in 2021 (something that has not occurred since the 1990s), despite a modest increase in oil prices. The current account will return to surplus in 2022-25 as the oil market recovers and petrol import volumes decline.

- Nigeria's business environment score worsens slightly for the forecast period (2021-25) as the macroeconomic and security environment remains highly challenging. As a result, its global and regional rankings fall.

Country forecast overview: Nigeria's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: The overarching policy objective is to promote self-sufficiency and local industrialisation through protectionism. As a result, the non-oil sector is be largely shielded from external competition.
2023-25: A new government (which is likely to be opposition-led) is likely to remain wary of opening up the economy.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Royalties for offshore oil activity that were introduced in 2020 are reduced in an attempt to prevent divestment by oil majors operating in Nigeria. Outside the oil sector, concerns over the foreign-exchange regime deter investment.
2023-25: Energy firms remain hesitant about increasing their presence in a difficult operating environment, especially onshore, but concerted efforts are made to clean up the national oil company (which is in joint venture with oil majors).
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Movement of goods is highly regulated to prevent smuggling, but people will be allowed to cross land borders once the coronavirus pandemic is brought under control.
2023-25: A spread between the official and the parallel-market exchange rates persists as oil prices rise and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is again able to defend an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxes 2021-22: The focus on boosting tax compliance intensifies, but the weak state of the economy and upcoming elections prevent tax increases. Value added tax (VAT) is increased to 10%.
2023-25: VAT is increased from 10% to 15% in two equal stages in order to manage persistently high debt-servicing costs.
Financing 2021-22: The government returns to the sovereign debt market, and capital projects are restarted.
2023-25: Credit conditions become tighter as the CBN moves to control high inflation.
The labour market 2021-22: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers, restrictive visa regulations and poor health indicators.
2023-25: Employers continue to struggle to find qualified staff; unemployment stays high and the labour market loose.
Infrastructure 2021-22: A reduction in consumer subsidies (for petrol) frees up resources for higher public capital investment, but government spending remains small relative to the size of the economy, at less than 7%.
2023-25: A large private refinery starts up, reducing Nigeria's near-total dependency on imported petrol.
Technological readiness 2021-22: Nigeria retains a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2023-25: Research spending remains low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960, and multi-party democracy was restored in 1999 after a protracted period of military rule. The first two presidential elections (in 1999 and 2003) were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. In 2015 Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari, who secured a second term in early 2019.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties predominate. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the predominant political force, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015 and secure re-election in 2019.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. The government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is a contentious issue, with important subsidy programmes hinging on an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take small as a share of GDP. With oil prices far lower than they were in 2010-14, it is likely that amendments to consumer taxes will be made, specifically in value-added tax (VAT, currently 7.5%).
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the president, Muhammadu Buhari, to stay in power until his second (and final) term expires in 2023. He will be under immense pressure to stabilise Nigeria, but myriad security threats will prove unmanageable. The military and police are overstretched and unable to tackle simultaneous security crises. Emergencies will be triaged, with military resources deployed to whichever is considered the most pressing.
This shaky system will keep the government in power but leave the country highly dysfunctional and, in many regions, extremely insecure. The government will remain embroiled in a conflict with Boko Haram and Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP), two Islamist terrorist groups firmly ensconced in north-eastern Nigeria. As the region is a stronghold of the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), the president will be committed to asserting control, irrespective of how difficult this will be. Boko Haram and ISWAP will be aggressively countered, but the north-east-particularly Borno state-will remain a low-level conflict zone, and the campaign there will divert security forces away from other insecure parts of Nigeria.
One hotspot that is likely to be more neglected is the agricultural Middle Belt, where violent conflict between farmers and herdsmen over increasingly scarce land and water resources has killed thousands in recent years. Formal land-titling is often touted as a solution to the crisis; however, as it would in effect alienate one group from communal holdings in favour of another, it would prove too contentious. As with the north-east, the direct effects of the conflict will be localised, but the entire country will feel the fallout in the form of reduced local food production and high prices.
The military and police will be poorly equipped to suppress pervasive banditry and kidnapping, particularly in the north-west. There is also evidence of terrorist groups operating more openly in the north-west, highlighted by a recent mass kidnapping at a school there. Over 2021-25 the region could begin to resemble the highly insecure north-east as, essentially, a "no-go" zone.
Nigeria's federal government has weathered severe but localised (largely rural) security problems for several decades without overall stability being jeopardised, but the near- to medium-term outlook is made more uncertain by the scars of recession in 2020 and by rising levels of unemployment and poverty. Declining living standards arguably exacerbated and prolonged protests over police brutality that broke out in cities across southern Nigeria in October 2020. Avoiding a repeat of these will be paramount for Mr Buhari's administration, and in practical terms this means that a pro-market reform agenda that made impressive headway in 2020-with subsidies relaxed on fuel and electricity-is judged to have wilted, and that should protests again break out, concessions would be expected.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch The next national elections are due in 2023. In the most recent presidential election, in 2019, the candidates of both main parties were from the north, and custom dictates that the candidates in 2023 will be from the south. This should lead to an improvement on the abysmally low turnout in 2019 in the south, which is a stronghold of the main opposition party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP). Frustration with high prices, declining living standards and perpetual instability will be directed at the APC, giving the PDP a winning edge.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations Nigeria will remain a major player in Africa given its size, but its domestic challenges tend to keep policymakers inwardly focused. Land borders that were closed to goods since late 2019 have reopened, but Nigeria's government is unlikely to show much enthusiasm over encouraging regional trade, beyond its obligations under the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCTFA). The trade pact compels Nigeria to eliminate 97% of tariff lines over the next five to ten years. This deadline will not be met early, given high prices in Nigeria and declining external competitiveness for industries that could otherwise benefit from regional market access. Protectionism (underpinned by foreign-exchange restrictions) also makes Nigeria's adoption of a common West African currency, the eco, highly unlikely.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends Nigeria's government and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will aggressively promote local industry, but some elements of policy are contradictory and will contribute to macroeconomic imbalances. A theme of considerable importance for overseas investment will be management of the exchange-rate regime. A ban on foreign-exchange access for imports of certain manufactures and agricultural goods (which currently covers 45 items) is being enforced to protect local industry and support the naira, but has some major flaws. Most notably, restrictions are elevating inflation and undermining the currency regime through sustained real effective exchange-rate (REER) appreciation. Despite this, currency restrictions are expected to last throughout the forecast period, being central to the CBN's economic development strategy.
There are multiple exchange rates in operation, with the central bank essentially overvaluing the official rate and-to a lesser extent-the Nigerian autonomous foreign-exchange fixing (NAFEX) rate, which is used by exporters and investors. There is now a wide spread between these and the parallel-market conversion. The CBN has given mixed messages about unifying Nigeria's exchange rates. Although strides were made in 2020 to merge the official and NAFEX rates, the CBN has allowed a differential to return and lasting adoption of a market-determined currency is not expected over 2021-25, with the CBN adamant such a move would lead to an overshoot and an inflationary spiral.
Faced with hard currency shortages in 2020, the CBN has allowed a backlog of foreign-exchange orders from investors and importers to accumulate in preference to drawing down reserves. Market turnover has recently edged up, but the backlog will only be cleared slowly in 2021 to modulate capital outflows, further undermining the currency regime's international reputation. A pattern of inflexibility by the CBN in the wake of oil price shocks (with similarly severe foreign-exchange shortages in 2015-16) will have a long-term impact on confidence, and partly explains our projection for foreign direct investment to equal 1% of GDP or less throughout the forecast period.
Over time the contradiction between protectionism and the AfCFTA's principles will become increasingly conspicuous, but we do not expect an immediate change in strategy given that non-tariff barriers will be phased out over a long timeframe. Developing manufacturing and agriculture is likely to be viewed as a means of preparing for the eventual elimination of tariffs, with currency controls expected to play a role in hastening the process. However, an infrastructure deficit, REER appreciation and instability in agricultural heartlands mean that Nigeria will struggle to acquire new comparative advantages in 2021-25, leaving the fiscal and external accounts and the naira exposed to oil price swings.
Price controls will be another important area of economic policy. Astonishing strides towards the deregulation of petrol and electricity pricing were made in 2020, but electricity price increases have already been scaled down in the face of political pressure. A reinstatement of outright petrol price controls is made less likely by a new Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) that we expect to be passed in 2021. The legislation is likely to streamline sector-wide regulation in the process of creating a new, profit-oriented national oil company, which by definition could not be weighed down by subsidising the retail market. The downstream industry should become commercially viable from this reorganisation of the sector, allowing Nigeria to wean itself off petrol imports, with a new 650,000-barrels/day refinery expected to come on stream in 2022. The PIB will also encourage upstream oil investment by making fiscal terms clearer for multinationals. However, we do not expect the sustained electricity price increases that are needed for the power sector to become financially sound, and pricing in the sector remains regulated de jure. Electricity undersupply will therefore continue to hinder industrialisation.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy We expect the fiscal account to stay in deficit in 2021-25. Receipts from crude oil make up more than 50% of the federal government's retained income, and an average world oil price of US$56/barrel in 2021-25 will be insufficient to balance the budget.
The federal government's tax take is among the worlds lowest, owing to widespread evasion and a large informal sector. Value added tax (VAT, currently of 7.5%) is viewed by the authorities as the most effective means of increasing fiscal receipts, and we expect three equal VAT rate increases, taking the rate to 15% by 2025. The first is expected in 2022, prior to the next elections but seemingly inevitable given a rising debt load. Further increases are expected in 2024 and 2025. Even then, our federal revenue projection peaks at just 4.9% of GDP in 2024.
Set against this, high debt-servicing costs, a large public wage bill and healthcare commitments-including procurement of coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccines-will elevate expenditure. Capital investment will also be emphasised from 2021 now that petrol subsidies (which were formerly taken from revenue) have ostensibly ended. The government justified price deregulation by promising to invest the savings in infrastructure, and will be under pressure to match rhetoric with action. Consequently, we expect the highest spending/GDP profile since the global financial crisis in the latter half of the forecast period.
Overall, we expect the fiscal deficit/GDP ratio to be broadly stable in 2021 compared with 2020, at 3.5%, given elevated healthcare costs and other spending pressures. This will decrease, reaching 2.7% in 2024 as revenue peaks, before widening again to 3% in 2025 as oil prices slide. The government has raised its public debt limit to 40% of GDP to incorporate higher budget shortfalls over the medium-term and to accommodate securitisation of CBN deficit financing as long-term debt. A debt/GDP ratio of 40% would be unmanageable given low revenue, but we expect the ratio to reach about 31% of GDP in 2025, with domestic borrowing prioritised by the government in the near term as real interest rates stay relatively low.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy The CBN will fail to keep inflation below a target ceiling of 9%, and its policy decisions are likely to be erratic. In 2020, given a probable recession and limited fiscal firepower, it decided to cut the policy rate by a cumulative 100 basis-points. The rate has been kept at 11.5% despite an upward trend in annual inflation, which reached 16.5% in January. The strategy is to boost the supply side of the economy to control inflation. We believe this is misguided; high and rising inflation will frustrate an economic recovery, and issues such as inadequate public infrastructure, direct funding of the fiscal deficit, hard-currency shortages and rampant instability need to be addressed before the supply side can moderate the price level. We expect high inflation to persist, compelling the CBN to raise interest rates in 2022, despite still-weak economic growth. Easing will resume only in 2024 when inflation has fallen appreciably.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth The economy is expected to exit recession in 2021 as the impact of lockdown in 2020 fades, but high inflation will impede improvements in business sentiment and dampen real purchasing power amid high levels of underemployment and low nominal wage growth. Fiscal stimulus will be an inadequate counterforce given budget constraints, and loosened monetary policy will pressurise the naira, creating a scarcity of foreign exchange and further undermining macroeconomic stability. Oil production will, however, rise slightly as quotas agreed by OPEC+ (comprising OPEC and a group of non-OPEC countries) are relaxed, and, given an uptick in oil exports, we expect growth of 1.1% in 2021.
The CBN is expected to tighten monetary policy from 2022, which will circumscribe but not halt the nascent economic recovery, but the exchange rate should stabilise and cause inflation to ease. As non-business financial penetration is low, private consumption will recover alongside disinflation even as interest rates rise. OPEC+ quotas will be raised from April that year and new refining capacity is expected to come on stream in earnest, boosting real exports (with some output for the regional market) and reducing imports. We therefore expect growth of 3% in 2022. As refinery output continues to ramp up, crude oil exports rise, inflation falls and real spending power recovers, growth will pick up to an annual average of 3.8% in 2023-24. However, these rates of growth are well below potential. The economy will continue to lack dynamism owing to high interest rates, low foreign direct investment (FDI), high unemployment, pervasive instability in agricultural regions and infrastructure deficiencies, particularly regarding stable power supply. A more challenging year is forecast for 2025 as oil prices fall and macroeconomic uncertainty rises, with growth slipping back to 1.6%.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation In 2021 we expect inflation to average 17%, with increases on both core and non-core levels. Higher world oil prices will translate into increased prices at the petrol pump following deregulation in 2020, and this will combine with the lingering pass-through of raised electricity tariffs, foreign-exchange restrictions on various imported goods-including staple foods-and devaluation of the naira. Assuming that rising oil prices stabilise the exchange rate, and that the CBN eventually tightens monetary policy, we expect the annual inflation rate to fall to an average of 10% in 2024. Conflict in the Middle Belt-Nigeria's breadbasket-as well as foreign-exchange controls on imported goods will prevent a faster fall. Currency devaluation in 2025 will cause the average rate to increase again, to 12.5% that year.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates A stronger outlook for world oil prices has softened our devaluation forecast for 2021, but we expect the official exchange rate to slide from N379:US$1 at present to N422.5:US$1 by end-2021 (probably in two stages). The more market-determined NAFEX rate has been weakening despite a recent oil price uptick-trading at about N410:US$1 in mid-February-and foreign reserves have declined since late January. The CBN is yet to clear a backlog of hard-currency orders that has built up, indicating that the draw-down is caused by a net outflow on current transactions despite firmer oil prices. The CBN is publicly opposed to making the exchange rate more flexible, but we believe a currency adjustment is unavoidable. Based on higher oil prices and the impact of devaluation in 2021, we expect the current account to return to surplus in 2022-24, while monetary tightening in Nigeria will again attract hot-money inflows. This should allow the official exchange rate to be kept broadly stable in these years. Unceasing currency misalignment means that REER appreciation will nonetheless resurface and, with oil prices expected to slide again in 2025, another devaluation to N485:US$1 is expected.
Forecasting the naira Although The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts both the official and the secondary market rates, it is the official rate that appears in most of its data presentations, as this is the longest-running and best-tracked variable. The official rate also best represents exchange-rate policy. Indicators that are converted into US dollars at the official rate are essentially overvalued, which is in line with official calculations.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector An export slump due to low world oil prices and OPEC+ production quotas will keep the current account in deficit in 2021, for a third consecutive year (a stretch unseen since the early 1990s), with a shortfall of 0.9% of GDP expected in that year. This is despite a slight uptick in imports of goods and services as the economy recovers and pandemic-related travel restrictions imposed in 2020 are lifted, with a devalued naira restraining the increase. Over the remainder of the forecast period we expect a small current-account surplus. Oil prices are projected to rise in 2022-23, which will expand exports while lower petroleum import volumes (as new domestic refinery capacity comes on stream) constrain growth in the import bill (which is otherwise driven by real naira appreciation). Remittances from the large Nigerian diaspora should also increase as the coronavirus crisis passes globally. This will all contribute to an annual average current-account surplus of 0.7% of GDP in 2022-24. The surplus will then ebb to 0.4% of GDP in 2025 as falling oil prices push down export earnings and continued REER appreciation encourage imports. The deficit in 2021 will be financed largely by debt inflows, with investment inflows being limited by a dysfunctional foreign-exchange market in that year.

Full text: - The right-wing government of the president, Jair Bolsonaro, has built an alliance with centrist parties in order to bolster governability in Brazil's highly fragmented Congress and to advance his economic reform and socially conservative agenda. Tensions with the judiciary will simmer as the authorities investigate the affairs of the president's sons.
- Economic policymaking will be guided by the need to manage the health and economic impact of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Fiscal, monetary and credit stimulus will be hefty, leaving considerable consolidation challenges in the recovery period. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the fiscal deficit widened to almost 14% of GDP in 2020, lifting the public debt/GDP ratio to 90%. Assuming recovery and consolidation in the medium term, we expect this ratio to stabilise.
- GDP will only recover fully to pre-pandemic levels in 2022. After an estimated GDP decline of 4.3% in 2020, the economy will grow by 3.2% this year. GDP growth will average 2% annually in 2022-25. Despite policy accommodation, Brazil's productive capacity will be damaged by the crisis, impairing medium-term potential growth.
- Interest-rate normalisation will begin in March, lifting the Selic policy rate from 2% to above 5% by 2022. We expect inflation will be above the 3.75% mid-point target in 2021 owing to higher commodity prices and a weak currency. Inflation will then be around the declining mid-point target (3.75% in 2021, 3.5% in 2022 and 3.25% in 2023) over the medium term.
- Assuming that international risk aversion eases once the coronavirus pandemic abates, we expect the Brazilian Real to recoup this year's losses, trading at below R5:US$1 from 2022. Assuming a recovery in import demand, the current-account deficit will widen to beyond 3% by 2025.
- Following recession in 2020, the projected recovery will expand Brazil's large domestic market to above US$2trn by 2025. Despite some simplifications, the tax system will remain burdensome and one of the weakest areas of the business environment. Infrastructure investment through a concessions prog-ramme will help to ease logistical bottlenecks, but upgrades and extensions will materialise only slowly.

- Fiscal consolidation needs after hefty stimulus during the coronavirus pandemic and the 2022 electoral cycle will complicate government efforts to improve the business environment and enact structural reforms. Brazil's large economy is attractive, but poor government effectiveness, a burdensome tax system, archaic infrastructure, deficiencies in factor markets and skills shortages will impair business.

Country forecast overview: Brazil's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Vested interests slow economy ministry's ambitious privatisations programme, but some divestments materialise.
2023-25: Privatisations continue slowly. Fiscal pressures encourage private capital in infrastructure projects. Investment Partnerships Programme (PPI) advances further, with improved legal framework and regulatory agencies.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic hits foreign direct investment (FDI).
2023-25: Ideological issues within current government put nationalist politics before economic pragmatism in some cases.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Despite anti-globalisation moves in advanced economies, some bilateral and regional trade negotiations progress. Deal between EU and Mercosul (Southern Cone customs union comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) not expected to be ratified by EU parliaments.
2023-25: Steps taken to make Brazilian Real a fully convertible currency.
Taxes 2021-22: Post-coronavirus consolidation needs may lead to higher taxes.
2023-25: Tax simplification unifies three federal, state and municipal taxes into one value-added tax (VAT).
Financing 2021-22: Financial system weathers pandemic; Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank) provides emergency credit. BCB gains independence, improving efficiency and competitiveness, reducing borrowing costs. Credit resumes after crisis.
2023-25: Renewed growth in domestic equity and bond issuance as state banks dial back subsidised credit lines.
The labour market 2021-22: Unemployment surges owing to pandemic. Government implements further measures to reduce cost of labour.
2023-25: Steps to boost long-term labour productivity complicated by continued weak education policies.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Infrastructure concessions advance (through PPI), but coronavirus, and political and institutional constraints may cause delays. Corruption and recession weigh on established construction companies, opening industry up for newcomers.
2023-25: Industry newcomers' lack of experience causes project delays.
Technological readiness 2021-22: Fifth-generation (5G) frequencies to be auctioned in 2021. Quality of communications rises as demand expands.
2023-25: Building of 5G infrastructure network commences and is rolled out to consumers.

Background: A new constitution was ratified in 1988 after more than 20 years of military rule. The government of Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995-2002) ended hyperinflation and advanced reforms to liberalise the economy. Under a former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-10), Brazil reaped the benefits of the reforms and enjoyed a consumer-led, commodities-fuelled boom. When this cycle ended, discontent owing to a weak economy, corruption and poor public services led to street protests. Lula's successor as president, Dilma Rousseff (2011-16), nonetheless won a second four-year term in 2014, but was impeached in 2016 over budget irregularities. Her vice-president, Michel Temer (2016-18), finished her term. Jair Bolsonaro won the October 2018 election and took office as president in January 2019.
Political structure: The president executes policy approved by the 513-seat Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and the 81-seat Senate (the upper house). Constitutional review is conducted by an independent judiciary. Although the president can resort to temporary decrees to push through legislation, the constitution gives Congress ample scope to check the executive. In the lower house, 30 political parties are represented and party discipline has traditionally been weak.
Policy issues: The benefits and entitlements established under the 1988 constitution have contributed to a doubling in central government primary spending, to over 27% of GDP. Congress passed a federal spending cap in 2016 and a robust pension reform in October 2019. However, the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic led to expansionary fiscal, monetary and credit policies to offset the hit to the economy and financial system; The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the public debt/GDP ratio rose to 90% in 2020. The Banco Central do Brasil (the central bank) cut the Selic policy rate to 2% in August 2020-a record low-but will soon begin rate normalisation.
Taxation: Brazil has a poorly structured revenue system characterised by a heavy tax burden, a narrow tax base, complicated levies and widespread evasion. Both foreign and domestic companies employ tax professionals and devote considerable resources to managing their tax affairs. The corporate and indirect tax systems are particularly complex, porous and unwieldy; the income tax system is considered to be relatively efficient, with a top rate of 27.5%.
Foreign trade: The pandemic-induced recession and a weaker Real narrowed the current-account deficit to an estimated 0.9% of GDP in 2020. Agricultural exports support a moderate structural trade surplus.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability The political environment will be shaped by the deployment of coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccines and the efforts of the right-wing, populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, to build a platform for his re-election bid in October 2022. His position has been strengthened by the election in February of his allies in the centrão (a group of traditional centrist parties that have long held the balance of power in Brazil's fragmented political system and now back Mr Bolsonaro) to key leadership posts in both the upper and lower houses of Congress. The new leader of the lower house, Arthur Lira of the Progressistas party, is likely to shelve opposition calls to open an impeachment trial against the president. This was previously a risk owing to the president's confrontational attitude towards Congress and the Supreme Court last year and his poor handling of the pandemic. Even so, to ensure governability by retaining the centrão's support, Mr Bolsonaro will need to grant party members political favours, including govern-ment posts and budget allocations. Meanwhile, the opposition-more progressive centrist parties as well as parties on the left-has suffered a blow and will struggle to reorganise following defeat in the congressional leadership elections. However, Mr Bolsonaro's unpredictable leadership style-displayed in his recent firing of the chief executive officer (CEO) of Petrobras (the state-controlled oil company) following local fuel price rises-and his often confrontational politics, which will come more to the fore in the election campaign, will remain features of the political landscape, sustaining tensions.
Mr Bolsonaro's popularity dipped after emergency cash payments ended in January. According to a local CNT/MDA poll, his rejection ratings rose to 51% in February, from 43% in October 2020. Looking ahead, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Mr Bolsonaro to try to retain the support of his core conservative voters and of his new-found lower-income voters (who are particularly concentrated in the populous Northeast) to boost his re-election chances, but he will struggle to do the latter. Retaining the support of low-income voters will largely depend on additional cash payments, which we expect will be re-introduced from March for four months, but at reduced levels and to fewer people (about half the 70m or so previous recipients). To rally his right-wing supporters, Mr Bolsonaro will seek to push forward his socially conservative agenda, although this will meet some resistance from opposition parties, who will seek to block the measures in Congress and via the Supreme Court.
Mr Bolsonaro's proximity to the military (he is a retired army captain) has fuelled tensions, especially with the judiciary. We expect calm relations for now, but tensions could resurface given the president's impetuousness and investigations into both him (relating to alleged political interference in the federal police in 2020) and his sons, Carlos (a local councillor, involved in "fake news" campaigns against political opponents) and Flávio (a senator, implicated in a local assembly graft scheme). Not only has the president put retired military officers in important cabinet positions (including Hamilton Mourão as vice-president), appointed them to run a third of Brazil's state-controlled companies and stacked lower-ranking officials in the state bureau-cracy, but in early 2020 he actively supported bolsonaristas who attacked opponents in Congress (as well as in the judiciary and media) and called for military intervention. Tensions around election time are likely. However, a rupture of constitutional rule is unlikely, as voters would protest; polls suggest that 75% of Brazilians support democracy as the best form of government. In addition, most high-ranking, active military officials are reluctant to be closely associated with Mr Bolsonaro.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch The November local elections saw a boost in votes for traditional centrist parties, suggesting that, regardless of their opinion of Mr Bolsonaro, voters are unlikely to elect a left-leaning president in October 2022. The field for the presidential race will be large, but it looks likely to be a re-run of the 2018 vote, with Mr Bolsonaro probably competing against the leftist Fernando Haddad, the runner-up in 2018. A former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-10), the most prominent member of Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT), recently backed Mr Haddad as its candidate, although the continuation of PT support assumes that Lula, who was convicted of corruption, does not unexpectedly become eligible to stand. However, the PT performed poorly in the local elections, and leftist parties are unlikely to unite behind a single candidate, which could reduce the chances of the PT candidate (or other emerging leftist rivals) contesting a probable second-round run-off. The surprise factor could come from a centre-right candidate such as João Doria, the governor of São Paulo state, but this third way could prove unsuccessful if centre-right parties also fail to unite. Notwithstanding the advantages of incumbency, a strong centre-right candidate could present a tougher contest for Mr Bolsonaro in a run-off, as the president would not be able to capitalise on anti-PT sentiment as he did in 2018. It is too early to make a call; Mr Bolsonaro's standing could be affected by unexpected developments in Brazil's tumultuous political environ-ment. His recent interference in Petrobras has damaged his reputation among the business community, who may look to back a more market-oriented figure.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations The president's anti-globalist rhetoric and facilitation of illegal deforestation in the Amazon rainforest is tarnishing Brazil's international standing. However, as one of the world's ten largest economies and a major commodity exporter, Brazil will remain a significant global player. Under the new US administration of Joe Biden, bilateral relations will be cooler while Mr Bolsonaro is president given their divergent stances, particularly regarding climate change and deforest-ation. The relationship got off to a bumpy start, as Mr Bolsonaro was the last major world leader to congratulate Mr Biden, but we assume that a pragmatic approach will prevail, with common ground on anti-Chinese sentiment.
Brazil will remain one of the battlegrounds in US-China rivalry; a fifth-generation (5G) licence auction scheduled for 2021 will prove tricky for the government given the local presence of Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications company. Anti-Chinese rhetoric by nationalist government figures is stirring bilateral tensions, but military figures will encourage the president to be pragmatic regarding China's acquisition of assets, as Brazil needs investments in major infrastructure and energy projects. Moreover, Brazil's reliance on the Chinese coronavirus vaccine, Sinovac, will also temper the government's anti-Chinese rhetoric. We do not expect a free-trade agreement (FTA) between the EU and Mercosul (the Southern Cone customs union comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) to be ratified soon, owing to EU concerns over Mr Bolsonaro's environmental policies. Now that there is also pressure from Mr Biden on environmental issues, Brazil's efforts to join the OECD face delays.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends Policymaking in 2021 will focus on the Covid-19 vaccine rollout and the government's structural reform agenda, which has been overshadowed by the pandemic. Mr Bolsonaro's commitment to reforms, and to fiscal consolidation and privatisations, generally remains lukewarm and is driven by his re-election interests. Policymaking has recently taken a turn for the worse and will now be more unpredictable and populist as Mr Bolsonaro seeks to avoid unpopular measures ahead of the 2022 elections and panders to his various groups of supporters. This was evident in his recent interference in Petrobras (to appease truckers' unions, who paralysed the country during a strike in 2018) after the firm raised fuel prices in line with international increases. Market risks include a change in Petrobras's pricing regime and possible efforts to reduce electricity tariffs by changing some rules of the game. If the economy stumbles, a more expansionary fiscal stance than expected in the 2022 election year cannot be ruled out, although it would encounter resistance in Congress.
Following the landmark approval of formal central bank independence shortly after taking office as leader of the lower house, Mr Lira's next legislative priority will be to pass the (delayed) 2021 budget. Parties will look for ways to find fiscal space to extend last year's emergency cash payments via a new social relief programme, while keeping to Brazil's 2016 constitutionally mandated public-spending cap, which Mr Lira (and the president) have vowed to uphold. However, it seems increasingly likely that they will seek a solution that sidesteps the rules. Nonetheless, any cash transfer programme will be much smaller in scale than the huge 2020 stimulus package. Thereafter, attention will turn to public-sector reforms, which aim to increase budget flexibility (over 90% of government spending in Brazil is non-discretionary) and reduce the costly public-sector wage bill. Political consensus around these reforms, which require constitutional amendments (known as the Federal Pact PEC, the Emergency PEC and the Public Funds PEC), has increased recently, making their approval (requiring three-fifths majorities in both houses of Congress) more plausible.
Other economic reforms will encounter more difficulties, although we still expect some progress by end-2021. Among them is a revenue-neutral tax simplification reform to unify three or more consumption taxes into a single value-added tax (VAT). Likewise, progress on the privatisation agenda will be slow owing to weak support from the centrão, as many of its members have vested interests in state companies. If any privatisations move forward, we expect them to be of smaller, non-strategic assets, such as the state-owned postal service; privatisation of Eletrobras, the state electricity company, is unlikely, even though Mr Bolsonaro recently sweetened the deal politically by offering legislators development funds from privatisation proceeds.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy After surging to an estimated 90% in 2020 owing to pandemic-related support measures, currency depreciation and recession, the public debt/GDP ratio will inch up as fiscal revenue only partly recovers. Stopping a more substantial rise will require consolidation; otherwise, concerns about debt sustainability will re-emerge among investors, raising the country risk premium. The government will seek to avoid raising taxes ahead of the 2022 election, but tax increases thereafter cannot be ruled out. The "state of calamity" approved by Congress amid the pandemic allowed the government to sidestep constitution-ally mandated fiscal rules in 2020 and increase spending, but extending this into 2021 (a growing possibility albeit not currently our baseline forecast) would unnerve investors. The fiscal hit from the crisis is apparent in the widening of the 12-month rolling overall deficit, to 13.7% of GDP in November 2020. We expect measures to be mostly retracted in 2021; the deficit will narrow to 7.6% of GDP as revenue increases. Consolidation of these trends will keep the deficit smaller than 7% of GDP throughout 2022-25. We anticipate that public debt will stabilise within the forecast period, helped by privatisation proceeds and currency revaluation, but there is a risk that debt will exceed 100% if the president yields to an election-related increase in spending.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy As the economy recovers in 2021-25, we expect policy normalisation, beginning in March, to take the Selic policy rate from 2% to 5.5% by 2023 (a real interest rate of 2-3%, which we consider neutral, up from over -2% currently). The mid-point inflation target will fall by 25 basis points each year in 2021-23, from 3.75% to 3.25% (the 2024 target will be set in 2021 and could fall further). The most significant risk to the environment of low interest rates and inflation is an unexpected abandonment of spending cap rules, which could trigger a market sell-off that may force the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank) to tighten policy by more than expected.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth Following an estimated 4.3% contraction in 2020, real GDP will recover partly in 2021, expanding by 3.2%. However, growth in 2021 overall will be mostly due to strong statistical effects from the 2020 rebound, as sequential growth will be limited by the withdrawal of most fiscal stimulus. Although low (albeit rising) interest rates and inflation will be supportive factors, along with a recovering global economy, lasting damage to the productive sector and jobs, and to corporate and household balance sheets, means that we do not expect output to return to pre-coronavirus levels until 2022.
We expect real GDP to contract in the first quarter of 2021 as cash transfers end and the public health crisis worsens. Growth will be limited in the second quarter, with a gradual pick-up thereafter, boosted by wider distribution of Covid-19 vaccines. Our forecasts assume the approval of fiscal reforms and progress on other microeconomic reform agenda items, but we recognise that governability risks could hamper advances.
On the demand side, the upturn in 2021-25 will be driven by stronger investment (buoyed by infrastructure concessions and notwithstanding a normalisation in interest rates) and by private consumption, supported by credit growth. The re-introduction of (more limited) emergency cash transfers for the poor in March-June will prop up consumption slightly until the jobs market strengthens later in the year. On the supply side, commodity exports will accelerate in 2021-25, in line with a recovery in global demand. Manu-facturing has already rebounded owing to stimulus for consumers and a weaker currency, which could continue to make goods more competitive against imports in 2021-25. Positive vaccine news should boost consumer and business confidence, but the recovery of the services sector will not materialise fully until vaccines have been distributed beyond vulnerable groups, which should happen from mid-2021.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation A stronger policy framework than in the past will help to anchor inflation expectations, and minimum-wage increases are unlikely to be much above infla-tion (if at all). There is a risk that inflation expectations will become unanchored if the government's commitment to fiscal consolidation wavers. Inflation reached 4.6% in February; we consider that the rise in inflation since mid-2020-related to higher food and commodity prices, a weaker currency and higher demand created by emergency cash transfers last year-will be transitory. Assuming a gradual economic recovery in 2021-25, and barring periodic weather-related food shortages, an unexpected surge in oil prices or fiscal slippage, inflation should fluctuate close to the (lower) mid-point targets for 2021 (3.75%), 2022 (3.5%) and 2023 (3.25%).
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates Swings in global conditions and jitters over fiscal risks will keep the Real volatile, but it should continue to regain some of its 2020 losses over the medium term. The Real made gains in late 2020 as coronavirus-induced risk aversion eased, and ended the year at R5.2:US$1-about 22% weaker than at end-2019-although it has faced renewed depreciation pressures this year amid deteriorating economic expectations and market jitters over fiscal risks. We expect the Real to strengthen to R4.85:US$1 by 2025, fluctuating in line with Brazil's terms of trade, interest-rate differentials and global risk sentiment. A deeper local capital market for long-term debt will discourage corporate external borrowing, reducing capital inflows. The main risk to the forecast is the possibility of a market sell-off if confidence in debt sustainability evaporates.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector Risks to Brazil's external position will be assuaged by its modest current-account deficit and external debt ratio, comfortable reserves cushion and a Real no longer overvalued by high interest rates (as in the past). Public external debt is low, and most companies have some sort of currency hedge, despite moderate private external debt. The trade balance will post a large structural surplus in 2021-25, owing to stable commodity exports to China, but this will narrow gradually as imports rise following recession-related compression in 2020.
After narrowing in 2020, the current-account deficit will widen gradually in 2021-25, as imports recover in line with the economy, and will reach 3.4% of GDP in 2025. However, inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) will match this, averaging 3.6% of GDP in 2021-25, reflecting sizeable market opportunities.

Full text: - The re-election of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president, in June 2018 concluded Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Mr Erdogan and his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) to stay in power until at least 2023 (when the next pres-idential and parliamentary elections are due), maintaining a tight grip on national institutions and the media in order to continue to dominate Turkish politics.
- The economy has become less stable as a result of domestic political tensions, fraught international relations and unorthodox economic policies. This has jeopardised the hard-won improvements in macroeconomic stability on which the AKP built much of its previous electoral success. The economic downturn in 2020 has led to the biggest credit growth boom in a decade, facilitated by Turkey's state banks and a politicised central bank and creating further sources of economic instability.
- Turkey's foreign policy priorities have shifted under the AKP since the early 2000s. Declining trust in the US and the EU, a gradual shift to a multipolar world and an ambition to make Turkey a regional power have all incentivised the AKP to pursue a "Turkey first" approach to foreign policy. Turkey is at odds with its peers in the eastern Mediterranean over maritime borders and vast offshore gas reserves. The risk of military confrontation with Greece, in particular, has risen. Mediation of the conflict by Germany and the US will be vital to de-escalate the volatile situation. Turkey has openly backed Azerbaijan in its military conflict with Armenia over Nagorny Karabakh, and has deployed peacekeeping troops to the region, along with Russian troops.
- Poor government policies and the lack of credible institutions have created large external imbalances and triggered a lira sell-off in 2020. We believe that Turkey will avoid a balance-of-payments crisis, but risks have risen.
- After a slowdown in real GDP growth to an estimated 0.4% and a forecast recovery of 4% in 2021 and 4.1% in 2022, we expect average growth of 3.6% per year in 2023-25-short of the government's annual 5% target but close to Turkey's medium-term potential.
- Turkey's heavy reliance on often volatile, short-term capital inflows to fund lending and drive economic growth leaves the economy vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. However, the country's location and its large consumer market make it an attractive place to do business.

- Turkey's business environment score deteriorates in the forecast period (2021-25). The country's global ranking drops by ten places to 55th, and it falls to last place in the regional ranking. Political tensions, increased powers concentrated under the president, a politicised central bank and high domestic inflation have raised uncertainty about the direction of economic policy.

Country forecast overview: Turkey's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Adverse market conditions delay any reform momentum and privatisation deals.
2023-25: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) has been a government priority, but macroeconomic instability, increased nationalism and concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2023-25: Further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors could boost FDI inflows.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: The threat of sanctions from the US and the EU continues to hurt Turkey's trade and investment environment.
2023-25: Negotiations with the EU to update the customs union are likely to be protracted, given poor Turkish-EU relations.
Taxes 2021-22: To finance widening fiscal deficit, government raises income and value-added taxes, including on alcohol and tobacco.
2023-25: Tax collection capacity will improve, but tax evasion remains an issue. No tax rises in the 2023 election year.
Financing 2021-22: The Central Bank of Turkey continues to raise its policy rate in early 2021, before gradually returning to an easing cycle. Government lending policy leads to a sharp increase in contingent liabilities.
2023-25: The government reverts to relying on state banks to extend credit and support economic growth. Continued reliance on capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues. Contingent liabilities remain problematic.
The labour market 2021-22: Government measures to support employment and ban layoffs end. The inactivity rate continues to rise and the size of the shadow economy increases.
2023-25: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Next stage of Istanbul airport is operational. Slower progress made on other projects, including Istanbul Canal.
2023-25: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. New industrial zones become operational. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks may persist.
Technological readiness 2021-22: Spending on research and development remains moderate, at about 1% of GDP, holding back efforts to move the economy up the value-added ladder.
2023-25: Turkey's young population spurs further rapid digital transformation of the banking sector.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe in 1949 and NATO in 1952, and signed an association agreement with the then European Community in 1963. A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade. Under current political circumstances, EU accession will not be possible in 2021-25.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religious conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule. There was a failed coup in July 2016. Turkey has had a presidential system of government, in place since the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, changed the parliamentary system in 2018, with parliament elected for a five-year term. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote. Since the failed coup, power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of Mr Erdogan, the AKP leader, who was re-elected for a second presidential term in June 2018.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability and stabilising the lira in the 2020 recession are the major policy challenges. The government rolled out a large fiscal stimulus to support the economy in 2020 and is using its state banks to expand credit growth. This has led to major external imbalances and a sharp lira sell-off. Negative real interest rates and high political risks have led to inadequate capital inflows into Turkey and increase the risk of a balance-of-payments crisis. The Kurdish issue, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, is an important challenge, but peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July 2015, and there has been a resurgence in violence. Politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The corporation tax rate was raised from 20% to 22% in 2018. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. In January 2020 the highest marginal tax rate was raised from 35% to 40% for incomes of more than TL500,000 (US$69,000). Reducing tax evasion was one of the elements of previous IMF programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2019 goods exports totalled US$182.2bn and imports about US$199bn, creating a trade deficit of about US$16.8bn, but a rare current-account surplus of US$6.9bn (1.1% of GDP).

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president, and his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) have dominated Turkey's political scene since 2002. During this period they have tightened their grip on authority, replacing Turkey's parliamentary system with an executive presidential system in 2018. The economy has become less stable as a result of political tensions, fraught international relations and unorthodox economic policies. This has jeopardised the hard-won improvements in macroeconomic stability on which the AKP built much of its previous electoral success.
Mr Erdogan's approval ratings dipped in 2020, following a steep sell-off of the Turkish lira against all major currencies, high inflation and a weak labour market. To restore policy credibility vis-à-vis foreign investors, while also trying to reverse worsening popularity ratings in 2020, Mr Erdogan made changes to Turkey's top economic management team in mid-November. In February Mr Erdogan also announced that discussions on a new constitution would begin soon. Details are not yet available, but it could include processes to ensure that Mr Erdogan stays in power beyond 2028, when his second term as president ends, if he wins the 2023 presidential election. Mr Erdogan has also vowed to introduce a number of economic and judicial reforms for 2021 and to improve human rights and strengthen property rights to appease Western govern-ments and foreign investors. Despite Mr Erdogan's calls for legal reforms, The Economist Intelligence Unit remains sceptical. The government will continue to clamp down on domestic political opposition in the years to come. Some political opponents of the government will also remain in prison on alleged terrorism charges, including a number of Kurdish opposition politicians.
In order to distract from domestic economic and political woes, the AKP also resorted to a more assertive foreign policy in 2020, including in Azerbaijan, Syria and the eastern Mediterranean. This tactic received wide domestic backing in 2020. Given that the authorities are well aware that Turkey's economic imbalances could spell trouble in 2021, we continue to expect Turkey's foreign policy to be particularly assertive this year.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch Mr Erdogan was re-elected president in June 2018, with 52.6% of the vote. At the parliamentary election, held at the same time, the AKP lost its absolute majority, although it secured a coalition majority with the Nationalist Action Party (MHP). The election process appeared to be mostly free but largely unfair: opposition candidates received little or no media coverage.
Mr Erdogan and the AKP are likely to win the next presidential and parlia-mentary elections-scheduled to be held in 2023-because of the president's dominance of the media, a systematic clampdown on political opposition and their popularity among Turkey's conservative voter base. However, the AKP will face tough competition from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP). According to a poll in early 2021 by MetroPoll, support for the AKP has fallen to its lowest point since 2002, at about 30%, and the CHP is polling at about 21%. The MHP is polling at just under 7%-below the 10% threshold to enter parliament. A new party founded by a former prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, and another by a former deputy prime minister, Ali Babacan, may also attract AKP supporters, as they target a similar conservative voter base, although not to levels that would threaten the AKP's hold on power. In the presidential election Mr Erdogan is currently neck and neck in the polls with Ekrem Imamoglu, the major of Istanbul and candidate for the CHP.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations The AKP and Mr Erdogan want to bolster Turkey as a regional power, and the government has been pursuing a more assertive foreign policy stance. This policy has backfired and resulted in deteriorating relations with regional peers and the West.
Turkey has antagonised Greece through continuous deployment of an energy exploration research vessel in disputed waters in the gas-rich eastern Mediterranean. The EU has strongly condemned Turkey's assertive behaviour and has warned that it might impose sanctions, although we expect that these would be only light restrictions. Greek-Turkish exploratory talks, which entered the 61st round, resumed in mid-January in Istanbul, but have not resulted in a settlement between the two NATO allies, and we expect tensions to persist.
Turkey has openly supported Azerbaijan after a conflict erupted with Armenia over Nagorny Karabakh in late 2020. Under Russian mediation, a ceasefire agreement has come into force. Turkey has deployed peacekeeping troops to the region, along with Russian troops, securing Turkey's influence in the south Caucasus.
Turkey's purchase of the Russian-made S-400 defence system in 2019, its ties with Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist group, and its provocations in the eastern Mediterranean have strained Turkish-US relations. Following Turkey's purchase of the defence system, the US introduced sanctions (in mid-December), but these are relatively mild and target Turkey's defence procurement agency, in effect cutting Turkey off from US military hardware and technology. Under the presidency of Joe Biden, relations with Turkey could take another turn for the worse, but although Mr Biden might be prepared to take a tougher line than the Trump administration with Turkey, US policy will probably continue to emphasise the need to keep Turkey in the Western camp. Nevertheless, there is still a risk that the US may impose tougher sanctions (for instance, if Turkey fully activates the S-400 defence system). In a worst case scenario, Turkey could join other US-sanctioned countries (Iran, North Korea and Russia), and would be denied access to international financial institutions. Turkey is attempting to cool tensions and has proposed setting up a joint working group with the US on the defence system.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends The economic downturn in 2020 has led to the biggest credit growth boom in a decade, facilitated by Turkey's state banks and a politicised central bank. This has kept inflation high through lira depreciation. However, in November 2020 Mr Erdogan changed course and replaced the central bank's governor, Murat Uysal, with the former finance minister, Naci Agbal. The Treasury and finance minister, Berat Albayrak (Mr Erdogan's son-in-law), announced his resignation and was replaced with Lutfi Elvan, a former deputy prime minister. These changes came after the lira approached TL8.5:US$1 in early November. Mr Agbal's appointment and the accompanying policy rate rises have pushed real rates into positive territory and strengthened the lira. Mr Agbal champions orthodox monetary policies and has the apparent consent of the president. Mr Erdogan has vowed that the central bank will deliver "price, financial and macroeconomic stability" and administer "bitter medicine" to the economy. This U-turn in the president's rhetoric marks a first step towards policy normality and transparency. However, there remains a risk that the central bank will come under political pressure to lower rates again, particularly if economic activity remains sluggish.
Although we remain sceptical that these new appointments will be sufficient to implement much-needed economic reforms, the risk of a financial crisis in 2021 has fallen. Reforms to address the structural imbalances that underlie its recurring boom-and-bust economic cycle are needed. If the government reverts to its preferred policy of unsustainable rapid credit growth, a sudden credit stop and a potential balance-of-payments crisis would follow in our forecast period. There is also a risk of US financial sanctions, which would further impede Turkey's ability to attract foreign-currency inflows and restrict Turkey's access to global debt markets.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy Under the AKP, the public finances have been one of the economy's most reassuring aspects, but this credibility is eroding.
The deficit reached an estimated 3.7% GDP in 2020 as coronavirus-related restrictions negatively affected revenue growth and the government deferred collection of some tax and social security premium payments. In 2021 the budget deficit will ease, to 3.1% of GDP. We expect Mr Elvan to introduce a more prudent approach to the public finances to restore policy credibility towards investors. Further increases in indirect taxes and a restructuring scheme for tax payments, social security arrears and other obligations to the state should also benefit the budget this year.
Ahead of the election year in 2023, we expect the budget deficit to stay elevated, averaging 2.8% of GDP per year in 2022-23. The deficit will then narrow, to an average of 1.8% in 2024-25, as the government tries to rein in spend-ing to reassure investors. Government debt is estimated at 33.8% of GDP this year, and will peak at 34.3% in 2022-23, before falling gradually to 31.3% in 2025.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy The Central Bank of Turkey implemented an ultra-loose policy in the early stages of the coronavirus crisis and cut the main policy rate by 300 basis points to 8.25% in the first half of 2020, pushing real rates firmly into negative territory. The central bank's accommodative policy had helped economic activity to recover, but also contributed to a lira sell-off, the rapid loss of foreign-exchange reserves and high inflation. From August 2020 the central bank reversed course and started to tighten policy, although the initial tightening was conducted via the back door. Only after it became apparent that the tightening measures were insufficient to stop the lira's slide did the central bank raise rates, by a total of 875 basis points to 17%, between September and December, compared with the annual rate of inflation of 14.6% recorded in December. Real positive interest rates have helped to restore Turkey's credibility with investors and will start to have a positive effect on curbing the dollarisation rate of lira deposits. The banking regulator abolished the "asset ratio" for banks, which previously forced lenders to extend credit and buy sovereign bonds, and which had been partly responsible for Turkey's credit boom.
The central bank left its main policy rate unchanged in January and February, but maintained its hawkish tone. Although the recent rate rises and the appointment of Mr Agbal are important signs that policy is becoming more orthodox, economic issues remain: the lira is weak, inflation remains high, large external imbalances have built up and foreign-currency reserves are low. We therefore expect the central bank to keep its rate unchanged in the first half of 2021, and to then ease it gradually towards the end of the year, cutting the policy rate to 15% by year-end as investor confidence returns and inflationary pressures abate.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth We estimate that Turkey's economy grew by 0.4% in 2020. The economy contracted in the first two quarters of the year (by 1.05% and 10.7% respectively quarter on quarter), but swift monetary loosening and rapid credit expansion led to an economic recovery of 19.1% in the third quarter. Expansionary monetary and credit policies were reversed in the fourth quarter, but high-frequency indicators (including industrial production and retail sales) point towards only a small contraction in the fourth quarter.
Coronavirus-related restrictions, which are dampening domestic demand, will result in subdued economic performance in the first few months of 2021. The Turkish government has ordered 50m coronavirus vaccine doses from China's Sinovac Biotech, and has already received 9.5m doses. The government has also agreed to procure 4.5m doses of the Pfizer (US)-BioNTech (Germany) vaccine, with an option to buy 30m additional doses. The vaccination programme only started in mid-January, but is among the fastest rollouts in the world; the authorities had administered 5.49 doses per 100 people as at February 16th-already ahead of most European peers.
To reduce economic imbalances, we expect that the authorities will keep fiscal, credit and monetary policy tight in the first half of 2021, but as the economy recovers gradually, we forecast full-year growth of 4%. A tight environment will constrain import growth in early 2021, and a stronger global macroeconomic backdrop this year will drive a partial recovery in export growth and support the external balance.
To restore investor confidence beyond 2021, additional reforms-such as guaranteeing the independence of the central bank and reducing government involvement in the banking sector-would be required. Nonetheless, despite its structural shortcomings, Turkey's catch-up potential is considerable and the economy is competitive, which underpins our view that growth will accelerate to 4.1% in 2022. In the 2023 election year we expect a stronger credit impulse to reappear, and real GDP growth of 3.9%. In 2024-25 we forecast average annual growth of 3.5%, which we believe is close to Turkey's medium-term potential.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation Inflation averaged a high 12.3% in 2020 as a result of the excessive lira deprecia-tion against the US dollar and the euro. We expect inflationary pressures to ease in 2021, with the rate declining to 11.1%, but to remain well above the central bank's official target of 5%, mainly because of high inflation expectations and rising global food and commodity prices. In 2022 we expect inflationary pressures to remain elevated at 9.5%, mainly because of higher oil prices.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates The lira, which depreciated to TL8.5:US$1 in the first week of November, from less than TL6:US$1 at the end of 2019, has since partly recovered, to about TL7:US$1 in mid-February. This follows the reversal of expansionary money and credit policies that had been introduced to combat the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Overall, the lira weakened by about 19% on average in 2020, despite central bank interventions. Foreign-exchange reserves fell from US$77bn in February 2020 to about US$54bn at end-January. Central bank swap agreements with domestic financial institutions rose to US$56.4bn at end-2020, from US$19bn in January. This implies that net reserves held by the central bank are negative.
In 2021 we forecast that the lira will weaken slightly in nominal terms, to an average of about TL7.3:US$1. Investor confidence in Turkish policymakers still hangs by a thread, international relations are poor and geopolitical risks remain high. In order to prevent more lira volatility, we expect the central bank to keep monetary policy tight in the first half of the year, before easing it thereafter.
In 2022-25 we forecast that the lira will follow a depreciatory path amid an elevated current-account deficit, high inflation and a gradual normalisation of monetary policy in the US and the euro area.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector We estimate a current-account deficit of 5.5% of GDP in 2020. We expect subdued domestic demand and the still relatively weak lira to temper imports in 2021, and forecast that the current-account deficit will narrow sharply to 1.9% of GDP this year as the economy begins to rebalance. Attracting sufficient capital inflows to cover the deficit, as well as to service foreign debt without further damaging the inadequate levels of foreign-exchange reserves, will require a continuation of more cautious economic and foreign policies. Conditions for borrowing from abroad have been improving since the return to orthodox monetary policy in November. The government raised a total of US$4.75bn through international bond issues in November and December, which was the first issuance since the outbreak of the coronavirus.
The Central Bank of Turkey has normalised policy by raising borrowing costs for lenders, curbing credit growth, minimising exchange-rate interventions and raising the repurchase (repo) rate. By keeping a tight policy, it will prevent a balance-of-payments crisis in 2021. These measures will help to increase the ability of Turkish bonds this year to attract sufficient capital inflows and meet the country's US$182.1bn external debt obligations, of which US$54bn are principal repayments. Banks' access to bond markets will remain constrained this year, but many may opt for short-term syndicated loans, which will allow them to roll over external debt. However, there is a risk that, if the authorities do not keep a tight policy in the next few months, Turkey will be unable to attract sufficient foreign-currency inflows this year. This could make capital controls necessary and prompt Turkey to ask the IMF for an emergency loan, despite Mr Erdogan's opposition to such a move.

Full text: - The tenure of the president, Muhammadu Buhari, will last until 2023 and be blemished by a decline in living standards caused by low growth, a rise in unemployment and (paradoxically) high, policy-induced inflation.
- The administration will struggle to tackle high levels of poverty and the country's ethnic and religious divisions. This potent mixture has the potential to cause protests that halt the advancement of pro-market reforms.
- A decline in living standards under Mr Buhari, whose tenure has been marked by two recessions, as well as frustrations over pervasive insecurity and poor governance means that the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) is forecast to win the 2023 election.
- The Economist Intelligence Unit expects some reregulation of electricity pricing under a PDP government. Although this would be bad news for the power sector, we do not expect a return to distortive pricing in the petroleum sector.
- Low world oil prices will continue to exert pressure on the multiple-exchange-rate regime and, in 2021, force another devaluation of the official rate. Foreign-exchange supply is then expected to improve, allowing the market to stabilise in 2022-25.
- Low oil prices in 2021 will coincide with large recurrent fiscal spending commitments (including healthcare) and result in another substantial fiscal deficit, by Nigerian standards. The budget shortfall will then broadly edge down as external conditions improve, the domestic economy picks up and revenue rises.
- Given a crippling infrastructure deficit, high inflation, instability in crucial agricultural regions and high unemployment, we expect growth of just 1.1% in 2021. Only when the exchange rate and inflation stabilise will there be a more meaningful recovery.
- Inflation will stay high in 2021 as devaluation of the naira, price deregulation, instability in agricultural growing areas, monetary loosening and exchange-rate restrictions for staple imports feed into consumer prices. Monetary tightening is expected to start from 2022 to tackle the issue.
- We expect a current-account deficit for a third consecutive year in 2021 (something that has not been seen since the 1990s) despite a modest increase in oil prices. The current account will return to surplus in 2022-25 as the oil market recovers and petrol import volumes decline.

- Nigeria's business environment score worsens slightly for the forecast period (2021-25) as the macroeconomic and security environment remains highly challenging. As a result, its global and regional rankings fall.

Country forecast overview: Nigeria's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: The overarching policy objective is to promote self-sufficiency and local industrialisation through protectionism. As a result, the non-oil sector is be largely shielded from external competition.
2023-25: A new government (which is likely to be opposition-led) is likely to remain wary of opening up the economy.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: A reduction is made to royalties for offshore oil activity introduced in 2020 in an attempt to prevent divestment from oil majors operating in Nigeria. Outside the oil sector, concerns over the foreign-exchange regime deter investment.
2023-25: Energy firms remain hesitant about increasing their presence in a difficult operating environment, especially onshore, but concerted efforts are made to clean up the national oil company (which is in joint venture with oil majors).
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Movement of goods is highly regulated to prevent smuggling, but people will be allowed to cross land borders once the coronavirus pandemic is brought under control.
2023-25: A spread between the official and the parallel-market exchange rates persists as oil prices rise and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is again able to defend an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxes 2021-22: The focus on boosting tax compliance intensifies, but the weak state of the economy and upcoming elections prevent tax increases.
2023-25: Post-election, value-added tax (VAT) is raised from 7.5% to cut the budget deficit and tackle the high stock of debt.
Financing 2021-22: The government returns to the sovereign debt market, and capital projects are restarted.
2023-25: Credit conditions become tighter as the CBN moves to control high inflation.
The labour market 2021-22: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers, restrictive visa regulations and poor health indicators.
2023-25: Employers continue to struggle to find qualified staff; unemployment stays high and the labour market loose.
Infrastructure 2021-22: A reduction in consumer subsidies (for petrol) frees up resources for higher public capital investment, but government spending remains small relative to the size of the economy, at under 7%.
2023-25: A large private refinery starts up, reducing Nigeria's near-total dependency on imported petrol.
Technological readiness 2021-22: Nigeria retains a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2023-25: Research spending remains low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960, and multi-party democracy was restored in 1999 after a protracted period of military rule. The first two presidential elections (in 1999 and 2003) were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. In 2015 Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari, who secured a second term in early 2019.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties predominate. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the predominant political force, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015 and secure re-election in 2019.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. The government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is a contentious issue, with important subsidy programmes hinging on an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take small as a share of GDP. With oil prices far lower than they were in 2010-14, it is likely that amendments to consumer taxes will be made, specifically in value-added tax (VAT, currently 7.5%).
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability The president, Muhammadu Buhari, will stay in power until his second (and final) term expires in 2023. He will be under immense pressure to stabilise Nigeria, but myriad security threats will prove unmanageable. The military and police are overstretched and unable to tackle simultaneous security crises. Emergencies will be triaged, with military resources deployed to whichever is considered the most pressing.
This shaky system will keep the government in power but leave the country highly dysfunctional and, in many regions, extremely insecure. The government will remain embroiled in a conflict with Boko Haram and the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP)-two Islamist terrorist groups firmly ensconced in north-eastern Nigeria. As the region is a stronghold of the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), the president will be committed to asserting control, irrespective of how difficult this will be. Boko Haram and ISWAP will be aggressively countered, but the north-east-particularly Borno state-will remain a low-level conflict zone, and the campaign there will divert security forces away from other insecure parts of Nigeria.
One hotspot that is likely to be more neglected is the agricultural Middle Belt, where violent conflict between farmers and herdsmen over increasingly scarce land and water resources has killed thousands in recent years. Formal land-titling is often touted as a solution to the crisis; however, as it would in effect alienate one group from communal holdings in favour of another, it would prove too contentious. As with the north-east, the direct effects of the conflict will be localised, but the entire country will feel the fallout in the form of reduced local food production and high prices.
The military and police will be poorly equipped to suppress pervasive banditry and kidnapping, particularly in the north-west. A recent mass school kidnapping in Katisna state highlighted the danger posed by sophisticated armed groups and was later claimed by Boko Haram. This serves as further evidence of terrorist groups operating more openly in the north-west, which is a development that the US military has warned about. Over the course of the forecast period, the region could begin to resemble the highly insecure north-east as, essentially, a "no-go" zone.
Nigeria's federal government has weathered severe but localised (predominantly rural) security problems for several decades without overall stability being jeopardised, but the near to medium-term outlook is given added uncertainty by the scars of recession in 2020 and rising levels of unemployment and poverty. Declining living standards arguably exacerbated and prolonged protests about police brutality in cities across southern Nigeria in October 2020. Avoiding a repeat of these will be paramount for the Buhari administration, and in practical terms this means a pro-market reform agenda that made impressive headway in 2020, with subsidies partly lifted on fuel and electricity, is judged to have wilted, and should protests again break out, concessions would be expected.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch The next national elections are due in 2023. In the most recent presidential election, in 2019, the candidates of both main parties were from the north, and custom dictates that the candidates in 2023 will be from the south. This should lead to an improvement on the abysmally low turnout in 2019 in the south, which is a stronghold of the main opposition party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP). Frustration with high prices, declining living standards and perpetual instability will be directed at the APC, giving the PDP a winning edge.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations Nigeria will also remain a major player in Sub-Saharan Africa given its size, but its domestic challenges tend to keep policymakers inwardly focused. Exasperation over smuggling, which policymakers view as undermining local industry, led the government to close all of Nigeria's land borders to goods traffic in late 2019 and only open them in late December 2020. Given high local prices and thus declining international competitiveness for Nigerian agricultural produce there will be no rush to open the economy up to food imports, although the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCTFA), to which Nigeria is a signatory, will require 97% of tariff lines to be eliminated over the next five to ten years. Protectionism (underpinned by foreign-exchange restrictions) also makes Nigeria's adoption of a common West African currency, the eco, highly unlikely.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends As part of its response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the government has sought about US$6.9bn (about 2% of GDP) from multilateral lenders. Not all the loans are low-conditionality, encouraging Mr Buhari to enact the boldest economic reforms of his tenure. A cap on pump prices was removed in September 2020, causing petrol prices to reach record levels (for Nigeria). Ending petrol price caps is essential for freeing up fiscal space, and new refineries that are either being built or at the planning stage (including a 650,000-barrel/day facility under construction) will require pricing to be suitable for supply to the domestic market. Electricity tariffs have also been raised. Moving towards cost-reflexivity is crucial to alleviate a burden of bad debts that run along the power supply chain, which has made the sector dysfunctional and resulted in regular outages.
However, political pressure means the government may well fail to keep prices liberal on a permanent basis, and there has already been a scaling-down of electricity price increases. A reinstatement of outright petrol price controls (despite rising crude prices in 2021) is made less likely by a new Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), which has a good chance of passing through parliament. The legislation is likely to streamline sector-wide regulation in the process of creating a new, profit-oriented national oil company (which by definition could not be weighed down by subsidising the retail market). The downstream industry should become commercially viable from this reorganisation of the sector, allowing Nigeria to wean itself off petrol imports as new refinery capacity comes on stream (which we expect to happen by 2022). The PIB will also encourage upstream oil investment by making fiscal terms clearer for multinationals. However, electricity tariffs are likely to remain heavily regulated, and we do not expect the sustained electricity price increases that are needed for the power sector to become financially sound. This implies that electricity undersupply will continue to hinder industrialisation.
Another policy area of considerable importance will be management of the naira. Low foreign-exchange inflows-reflecting low global oil prices-has provided scope for unifying the overvalued official exchange rate (used for government transactions) and the more market-determined Nigerian autonomous foreign-exchange fixing (NAFEX) rate, used by exporters and investors. A wide spread between these and the parallel exchange rate underlines ongoing market distortions, however. Rather than let the naira weaken on a sustained basis (political considerations are likely to be paramount in this regard) or clear a large foreign exchange order backlog by depleting reserves, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has widened an array of currency restrictions and let market turnover contract, widening the spread between the NAFEX and parallel rates, to aggressively curb the pace of outflows. Such policies will sustain considerable foreign-exchange illiquidity into 2021 as oil prices stay low.
The government plans to manage the exchange-rate regime "sustainably" only in the long term, and a range of market distortions are expected to stay in place in 2021-25 to protect local industry. A ban on accessing foreign exchange to purchase various imports (currently covering 45 foods and manufactures) is central to this strategy. Over time, the contradiction between protectionism and the principles of AfCFTA will become increasingly conspicuous, but we do not expect an immediate change in strategy, given that non-tariff barriers will be phased out only slowly. Industrialisation is likely to be viewed as a way of preparing for the eventual elimination of tariffs, with currency controls expected to play a role in hastening the process. However, an infrastructure deficit and instability in agricultural heartlands mean that Nigeria will struggle to acquire new competitive advantages over 2021-25, leaving the fiscal and external accounts and the naira heavily exposed to oil price swings. From an investor perspective, the managed nature of the exchange-rate regime poses a risk of capital controls, especially when oil prices are low. Partly because of the impact on investor confidence, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows are projected at 1% of GDP or less throughout the forecast period.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy We expect the fiscal balance to stay in deficit in 2021-25. Crude oil receipts comprise more than 50% of the federal government's retained income, indicating a continued revenue crunch as oil prices stay low in 2021. Even then, widespread tax avoidance and low oil prices (below US$60/b on average in 2021-25) will keep federally retained revenue below 4% of GDP throughout the forecast period.
Set against this, high debt-servicing costs, a large public wage bill and emergent healthcare commitments will elevate expenditure. Capital investment for the purposes of stimulus will also be emphasised in 2021 now that subsidies (which were formerly taken from revenue) have been reduced, freeing up resources. Even so, we expect economic growth to fall well short of official projections in 2021, and a revenue undershoot indicates underexecution of the capital budget, being the most flexible spending category. Overall, in 2021 we expect a deficit equal to 3.6% of GDP, down only slightly from 3.7% of GDP in 2020. Higher oil prices will lessen the deficit in 2022, despite a pre-election increase in spending. With a probable rise in value-added tax (VAT) rates (to curb a hazardously high debt-revenue ratio) after the 2023 elections, and oil prices continuing to rise, the deficit will shrink to an average of 2.8% of GDP in 2023-24, before widening to 3% of GDP in 2025 as oil prices fall.
As interest rates are currently low for the sovereign, domestic debt will be more attractive in the near-to-medium term. The 2021 budget revealed considerable direct lending to the government by the CBN as well, with financing facilities likely to be tapped whenever domestic debt issuance rises above budgeted levels. Some multilateral loans will also be secured, but we expect the government to return to the international capital market from 2021 in order to supplement this.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy The CBN will fail to prevent inflation from exceeding its target ceiling of 9% over much of the forecast period, and its policy decisions are likely to be erratic. In the context of a probable recession and limited fiscal firepower, it decided to cut the policy rate by 100 basis points to 11.5% in September 2020 (after a 100-basis-point cut in May), despite an upward trend in annual inflation, which reached 15.7% in December. The strategy is to boost the supply-side of the real economy and thereupon control inflation. In our view this is misguided; high and rising inflation will frustrate an economic recovery, and issues such as inadequate public infrastructure, direct funding of the fiscal deficit, hard-currency shortages and rampant instability need to be addressed before the supply-side can moderate the price level. Our expectation is for high inflation to persist, compelling the CBN to raise interest rates in 2022, despite economic growth still being weak. Easing will resume only in 2024 when inflation has fallen appreciably.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth The economy is expected to exit recession in 2021 as the impact of lockdown in 2020 fades, but high inflation will impede improvements in business sentiment and dampen real purchasing power amid high levels of underemployment and so low nominal wage growth. Fiscal stimulus will be an inadequate counterforce given budget constraints, and loosened monetary policy will pressurise the naira, creating a scarcity of foreign exchange and further undermining macroeconomic stability. Oil production will, however, rise slightly as quotas agreed by OPEC+ (comprising OPEC and a group of non-OPEC countries) are relaxed, and given an uptick in oil exports we expect growth of 1.1% in 2021.
The CBN is expected to tighten monetary policy from 2022, which will circumscribe the nascent economic recovery, but the exchange rate should stabilise and cause inflation to ease. As non-business financial penetration is low, private consumption will recover alongside disinflation even as interest rates rise. OPEC+ quotas will be raised from April that year and new refining capacity is expected to come on stream in earnest, boosting real exports (with some output for the regional market) and reducing imports. Consequently, we expect growth of 3% in 2022. As refinery output continues to ramp up, crude oil exports rise, inflation falls and real spending power recovers, growth will pick up to an annual average of 3.7% in 2023-24. However, these rates of growth are well below potential. The economy will continue to lack dynamism owing to high interest rates, low FDI, high unemployment, pervasive instability in agricultural regions and infrastructure deficiencies, particularly regarding stable power supply. A more challenging year is forecast for 2025 as oil prices fall sharply and macroeconomic uncertainty rises, with growth slipping back to 1.7%.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation Monetary loosening in 2020 (which will lead to currency adjustments), combined with higher fuel and electricity tariffs, foreign-exchange restrictions on various imported goods, including staple foods, and devaluation of the naira will raise inflation to an average of 16% in 2021, with increases on both the core and non-core level. Assuming that rising oil prices stabilise the exchange rate, and the CBN eventually tightens monetary policy, we expect the annual inflation rate to fall throughout 2022-25, to 8.5% at end-2025. Conflict and agricultural supply disruptions in the Middle Belt-Nigeria's breadbasket-as well as foreign-exchange controls on imported goods will prevent a faster fall.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates The CBN is supplying hard currency to regulated trading windows but only fitfully, and there is a large backlog of unmet foreign-exchange orders for capital and current transactions. Assuming that oil prices stay low in 2021 and with low domestic interest rates sustaining capital outflow pressures, we expect a devaluation of the official rate in that year (following two adjustments in 2020). This will take the naira from N379:US$1 at end-2020 to N450:US$1 by end-2021. The official and NAFEX rates will be broadly unified in the process. For the remainder of the forecast period, the official exchange rate is expected to be kept relatively stable. Monetary tightening in Nigeria will again encourage hot money inflows, and higher oil prices will return the current account to surplus. Divergence between official and NAFEX rates is likely to re-emerge, but the CBN should be able to supply adequate liquidity to regulated foreign-exchange channels, broadly stabilising the market even as world oil prices (and so net foreign-exchange flows) fluctuate.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector An export slump owing to low world oil prices and OPEC+ production quotas will keep the current account in deficit in 2021, for a third consecutive year (a stretch unseen since the early 1990s), with a shortfall of 1.4% of GDP expected in 2021. This is despite a slight uptick in imports of goods and services as the economy recovers and coronavirus-related travel restrictions imposed in 2020 are lifted, with a devalued naira restraining the increase. Over the remainder of the forecast period a small current-account surplus is expected. Oil prices are projected to rise in 2022-23, which will expand exports, while lower petroleum import volumes as new domestic refinery capacity comes on stream will constrain growth in the import bill (otherwise driven by real naira appreciation). Remittances from the large Nigerian diaspora should also increase as the coronavirus crisis passes globally. This will all contribute to an annual average current-account surplus of 0.9% of GDP in 2022-24. The surplus will then ebb to 0.7% of GDP in 2025 as falling oil prices push down export earnings and continued real effective exchange-rate appreciation encourage imports. The deficit in 2021 will be financed largely by debt inflows, with investment inflows being limited by a dysfunctional foreign-exchange market in that year.

Full text: - At the federal election on September 26th Angela Merkel will step down from her 16-year tenure as chancellor, and The Economist Intelligence Unit expects a coalition to be formed between the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and The Greens. We expect Markus Söder, the minister-president of Bavaria and leader of the CDU's sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), to be chosen as the CDU's chancellor-candidate, rather than the CDU's new leader, Armin Laschet-who is substantially less popular with the German public.
- The top policy goal at present is to stimulate the economic recovery, which requires the pandemic to be controlled and vaccinations rolled out. Following the federal election, we expect policymaking to remain centrist, consensus-oriented and pro-Western, with a strong degree of continuity from the current administration. However, green policymaking will gain additional importance.
- After a 5.3% fall in real GDP in 2020, we forecast 3.7% growth in 2021, with the recovery gaining pace in the second half of the year and the economy returning to its 2019 size by 2022. Germany's large manufacturing sector, which has close export links with the rapidly recovering Chinese market, has proved a structural advantage during the pandemic. Forced savings, pent-up demand and an extended wage support scheme will boost private consumption once the lockdown ends. We forecast 2.4% annual average growth in 2022-25.
- Monetary and fiscal policy levers are being used to the full to limit the fallout from the crisis. The European Central Bank (ECB) has its policy rate set at -0.5%, and has expanded its net asset purchases to EUR1.85trn (over 10% of euro zone GDP) as part of its emergency programme.
- Germany's fiscal policy response in 2020 was the largest in Europe. Provisional data indicate a 4.8% of GDP deficit in 2020 (although this does not reflect substantial loan guarantees from the state development bank, KfW), and fiscal support will continue in 2021. We expect political pressure to ensure a return to fiscal consolidation from 2022, although rising pension and healthcare commitments will maintain small deficits (within 1% of GDP) in 2023-25.
- Germany's large-and often controversial-current-account surpluses will persist, owing to huge trade surpluses and large domestic savings invested abroad. The current-account surplus dipped slightly to an estimated 6.8% of GDP in 2020, and we expect it to remain broadly unchanged as a share of GDP.

- The business environment benefits from political stability, a skilled labour force, openness to external trade and investment, and well-developed (if ageing) infrastructure. The exposure to external shocks is a constraint.

Country forecast overview: Germany's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: The state maintains its involvement in the financial sector, railways and telecommunications, and rolls out aid packages to companies highly affected by the pandemic. Germany accounts for about half of new state aid in the EU.
2023-25: Limited prospects for reforming regulated service professions. State intervention pushes green and digital goals.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: The government generally welcomes foreign direct investment, but Germany has lobbied hard to increase scrutiny at the EU level, and takeovers of major German media, infrastructure and finance companies now meet political resistance.
2023-25: Investment from China is increasingly unwelcome, given concerns about intellectual property leakage.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Pressure on German export sector from coronavirus hit to global demand, ongoing US-China trade war and Brexit disruption. Risk of escalation in US-EU trade tensions. Possible delays in progress on EU-Mercosur trade deal.
2023-25: EU makes further gradual progress on bilateral trade deals. Decline in post-Brexit UK-EU crossborder trade.
Taxes 2021-22: Fiscal loosening as part of the crisis response includes higher spending on healthcare, direct aid to self-employed people and an expansion of unemployment benefits. A comparatively high labour tax burden persists.
2023-25: Modest reform of management of corporate tax. Possible introduction of digital tax.
Financing 2021-22: Highly accommodative monetary policy keeps banks' funding costs and liquidity in the sector high. The government assumes most of the risk in financing this year via state-backed loans to businesses.
2023-25: Operating conditions for banks remain challenging. Ongoing efforts to attract financial services firms from the UK.
The labour market 2021-22: Unemployment is higher than pre-pandemic, but contained by the expansion of the Kurzarbeit scheme to end-2021.
2023-25: Limited prospects for reform to address structural challenges arising from ageing demographics and increasing share of migrant workers. Increased provision of childcare facilities supports moderate rise in female participation.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Investment in healthcare infrastructure. Focus on maintenance of transport network and improved digital access. Energy transition focuses on a national hydrogen strategy, and the sector calls for improvement of the power grid.
2023-25: New policy measures to meet medium-term emission targets, including gradual phasing-out of coal generation.
Technological readiness 2021-22: The government prioritises upgrading the country's digital infrastructure and investing in artificial intelligence.
2023-25: Efforts continue on Industry 4.0, which focuses on upgrading manufacturing prowess through increased use of automation and connected systems. Increasing threat from cybercrime and cyber-espionage.

Background: The modern German state was founded in 1870. After the second world war (1939-45) Germany was divided into two parts: a liberal parliamentary democracy in the west and a totalitarian communist regime in the east. On October 3rd 1990, after the end of the Soviet Union's hegemony in central and eastern Europe, Germany was reunified.
Political structure: Germany is a federation of 16 states, or Länder, each of which has its own constitution, government and parliament. The states are primarily responsible for policing and education. The federal parliament comprises the directly elected Bundestag (the lower house) and the Bundesrat (the upper house) of representatives of the state governments. The federal chancellor, the head of the executive, is elected by the Bundestag and can be brought down only by the election of a successor. In March 2018 a grand coalition was once again formed, comprising the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD).
Policy issues: Short-term priorities focus on the response to the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic crisis. Medium-term priorities include managing the transition of the automotive sector towards lower-emission vehicles; building industrial sovereignty and increasing the resilience of supply chains; managing rising tensions with Russia and China; implementing the roll-out of fifth-generation (5G) technology, alongside continuing progress on the Industry 4.0 agenda; and transitioning the energy sector away from coal and nuclear power. Investment spending will increase in our forecast period (2021-25) compared with recent years.
Taxation: The federal corporation tax rate was cut from 25% to 15% in 2008. The effective corporate tax rate, including a municipal trade tax and a solidarity tax, is about 30-33%. The solidarity tax will be phased out from 2021. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45%. Social security contributions are shared equally between employers and employees. The main value-added tax (VAT) rate is 19%, but will be temporarily reduced to 16% during the second half of 2020.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus came to US$247.5bn in 2019, with export earnings at US$1.5trn and import costs at US$1.2trn. Germany's single largest goods export market is still the EU, but the country has been more successful than most in diversifying its markets and selling into fast-growing emerging markets over the past decade.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability Angela Merkel, the chancellor, leads a grand coalition comprising the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU)-along with its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU)-and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). The 2017 federal election delivered a fragmented political landscape that made coalition-building difficult, and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) won seats in the federal parliament for the first time. At the federal election in September 2021 Mrs Merkel will step down from her 16-year tenure as chancellor-a significant turning-point for Germany's political landscape. However, policymaking will remain centrist, consensus-oriented and pro-Western under the next government.
Mrs Merkel's already high approval ratings have risen during the coronavirus pandemic, with her calm demeanour, respect for scientific advice and recognised ability to manage crises reassuring voters. Germany's response to the public health crisis has been notable for stronger testing and contact tracing than other European countries, and a more localised response-both made possible by the country's decentralised administrative structure. Excess hospital capacity also proved an advantage. Nonetheless, during the (much worse) second wave over the winter, tensions have risen between federal and state-level authorities over the appropriate level of restrictions. Social unrest and "pandemic fatigue" have also emerged, with protests against social distancing and mask-wearing rules, especially in Berlin, the capital.
The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that the September 2021 federal election will lead to a CDU/CSU-Greens coalition, with the CDU's chancellor candidate succeeding Mrs Merkel. Armin Laschet, the centrist governor of North Rhine-Westphalia, was chosen as the CDU's new party leader on January 16th (in line with our forecast), but will not necessarily become the party's chancellor candidate, given his unspectacular poll ratings. Markus Söder, the leader of the CSU and governor of Bavaria, has won increasingly strong support among both party members and the general public during the pandemic, and although he has not yet declared his intention to run, we consider him the most likely choice. The decision on a candidate will only be taken after the state elections in March, either by the CDU/CSU leadership or its parliamentary deputies (there is no fixed process).
We would expect a CDU/CSU-Green coalition to be less fractious than the current grand coalition has proved, resulting in a rise in political stability. The parties share similar views on economic and climate change policies, and policy towards Russia. Frictions could be expected on fiscal policy, however, where the CDU/CSU will want to take a more hawkish stance, and relations with China, where The Greens will be more openly critical.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch The next federal election will take place on September 26th, and will result in a change in German chancellor for the first time since 2005. State elections in Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate on March 14th will provide early insights into voter support for the CDU, the SPD and The Greens. Baden-Württemberg is currently led by The Greens, and polls suggest that they are ahead of the CDU. Polls in Rhineland-Palatinate show the CDU narrowly ahead of the SPD, but the outcome here is far from certain, given the popularity of the state's SPD minister-president, Malu Dreyer. Poor results for the CDU in these elections would increase the likelihood of Mr Söder being chosen as chancellor candidate over Mr Laschet. A third state election will be held in Saxony-Anhalt (currently with a CDU-SPD-Greens coalition) in June.
At the federal level, opinion polls have been fairly consistent in recent months, with the CDU/CSU polling around 35%, the Greens around 19%, the SPD at 15%, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) at 9%, the Left Party at 8% and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) at 6%. This suggests that the CDU/CSU should be able to win a majority with The Greens. However, there are two "known unknowns". First, the impending departure of Mrs Merkel, who remains Germany's most popular politician, might not yet be reflected in the CDU's polling numbers. Second, continued slow progress in Germany's coronavirus vaccination programme could work to weaken the CDU's popularity.
Voter fragmentation will continue in 2021, but we expect the parties on the political extremes (the Left Party, and the AfD on the far right) to remain excluded from mainstream debate and from any governing coalition. An SPD-Green-Left Party coalition might be a mathematical possibility, but the uncompromising left-wing views of the Left Party make this unlikely. Should the CDU/CSU-Greens fail to win a majority they could be joined by the FDP or perhaps the SPD-although the latter is keen to avoid another grand coalition.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations The European economic recovery fund clears the way for joint debt issuance (worth EUR750bn) to be channelled to EU member states with lower living standards and those hardest hit by the pandemic. From mid-2021 about EUR390bn is to be transferred in grants and the remainder through loans. The size of the fund is modest, but it will help to increase fiscal space in highly leveraged countries; Germany's U-turn on joint debt issuance in May was crucial to the agreement. The fund is a landmark step for the bloc, as it establishes a precedent for the EU to issue debt to fund common needs.
We expect US-EU relations to improve under the new US president, Joe Biden. Mr Biden will prefer diplomacy to tariffs, reducing the threat of a US-EU trade war, and is already returning the US to a number of multilateral platforms, including the Paris Agreement on climate change. However, on other issues-including OECD-level negotiations on a digital services tax, and EU relations with China-relations will remain strained.
Other EU external relations came under strain in late 2020. The poisoning of Alexei Navalny, a Russian opposition activist, prompted an unusually hawkish German response. We do not expect Germany to halt construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in the near term, but it may take other punitive measures against Russia. The EU and China have agreed in principle to conclude negotiations on a Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, but the ratification process by the European Parliament will be challenging, given European concerns about human rights and labour standards, and restrictions on allowing Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications firm, to build fifth-generation (5G) telecoms infrastructure.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends As elsewhere in Europe, Germany is now well into the second wave of the pandemic, which has proved much more severe than the first wave, putting strains on hospital capacity and rendering the test and trace system ineffective. A "lockdown light" was imposed on November 2nd and substantially tightened on December 16th; we expect most of the current restrictions to be extended when they come up for renewal on February 14th. The vaccine rollout has begun, but is proving slow: one week into February Germany had given first doses to just 3.9% of its population, versus 18.8% in the UK.
The European Commission has temporarily relaxed its state-aid rules, in view of the exceptional circumstances this year, and we do not expect these to be reimposed until 2022 or (more likely) 2023. Germany's state-aid disbursements comprise about half of the EU total. Lufthansa, Germany's largest airline, is the biggest recipient, with a EUR9bn bail-out, followed by EUR3.3bn for Adidas, Europe's largest sportswear retailer, and EUR2bn for TUI, a multinational travel company. Firms in receipt of state aid may come under pressure to promote sustainability and to pay taxes in Germany rather than in lower-tax-rate jurisdictions.
Other ongoing areas of policy debate include how to build industrial sovereignty, raise the resilience of supply chains and support the transformation of the automotive sector towards low-emission vehicles. With The Greens all but certain to join the next federal coalition, the CDU and the SPD will both present policy programmes with a green agenda in 2021. The government's decision to support electric vehicles but not the automotive sector more generally in 2020, despite the industry's large lobby and the fact it accounts for about 830,000 jobs, is an indication of the policy direction.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy After six years of fiscal surpluses, the budget shifted into deficit in 2020, at 4.8% of GDP (provisional data). Germany's fiscal support and stimulus programmes are the largest in Europe, with key components including the following:

- the Kurzarbeit programme, a furlough scheme that allows firms to cut employees' working hours without having to lay them off, with the state paying at least 60% of the lost net wage payments until end-2021;
- a EUR50bn solidarity fund to help small businesses and the self-employed, and liquidity support for all companies that need assistance paying loans, irrespective of their size, totalling EUR500bn;
- a EUR3.5bn cash injection into the healthcare system, and transfers to local governments to help manage the crisis;
- a value-added tax (VAT) cut from 19% to 16% for July-December 2020, and a reduction in the VAT rate for the hard-hit hospitality sector to 7% until mid-2021 and until end-2022 for meals in restaurants and cafés.
- cash transfers to businesses that are forced to close under the winter lockdown, along with new tax deductions announced in February.

The government will run another deficit in 2021, albeit a smaller one. The Kurzarbeit programme will remain in place throughout the year and capital expenditure will be higher than before the pandemic. Over the next four years investment will be channelled to everything from artificial intelligence (AI), to the 5G rollout, to innovation in auto manufacturers. The health fund will receive a significant boost and a large chunk of the money will go to Germany's national hydrogen strategy, as part of its energy transition.
We expect Germany's public debt to peak at just over 72% of GDP in 2021, from around 60% in 2019. The government is taking advantage of an exception clause in the country's constitutional debt brake for crisis periods, lifting limits on new borrowing. The debt brake will remain suspended this year, but fiscal consolidation will then return-bringing the public debt/GDP ratio back to about 65% by end-2025.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy The European Central Bank (ECB) has deployed an arsenal of policy weapons to limit the financial and economic fallout from the public health crisis. In addition to the open-ended quantitative easing (QE) programme and negative interest rates, several crisis tools have been brought into play.
Among the most effective are the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and the boost to refinancing operations for commercial banks. The PEPP was designed to be temporary and flexible in order to allow the ECB to front-load purchases and cater to the countries with higher funding needs. Liquidity facilities have also been revamped, with the ECB formally adopting dual rates and easing rules around its collateral framework. These have prevented a damaging credit crunch by supporting bank lending to non-financial corporations, which was up by 6.3% year on year in November.
In view of the deflationary impact of the second wave of coronavirus in the euro zone, the ECB provided further stimulus in December. This includes a EUR500bn increase in the size of the PEPP, which is now worth EUR1.85trn, and an extension of its duration until March 2022. The ECB remains strongly committed to preventing financial fragmentation in the euro zone, which will keep at bay the risk of sovereign debt crises in highly indebted economies. Funding costs will remain very low in the medium term, and increases to policy rates are not part of our baseline scenario in 2021-25.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth The German economy contracted by 5.3% in 2020, the first annual fall since the 5.6% contraction in the wake of the global financial crisis. Nonetheless, this was less severe than in the other major economies in western Europe, which fell by between 8.3% (in France) and an estimated 11.4% (Spain and the UK). Germany's better outturn reflects less stringent lockdowns, massive govern-ment support and a large manufacturing sector-equivalent to 20% of gross value added, and closely tied to the strongly recovering Chinese market-which was able to continue operating with social distancing measures.
We expect real German GDP to return to 98.2% of its 2019 full-year size in 2021, a more rapid recovery than the west European average, with annual growth of 3.7% in 2021 and 4% in 2022 (the latter reflecting strong carry-over effects). Consumers will maintain high precautionary savings this year, but much of the forced savings resulting from lockdowns and deferred investment will be drawn down to satisfy pent-up demand in the second quarter, once restrictions are lifted. Furthermore, the Kurzarbeit scheme has been extended to end-2021, which will support disposable incomes. Construction was a bright spot in 2020, expanding as housebuilding continued, and we expect this trend to be maintained; Germany's export-oriented manufacturing firms will also continue to benefit from growing demand in Asia. However, in-person services will take longer to recover, and the immediate outlook is not promising. Not only will the lockdown curtail consumer spending, but firms' stockpiling at end-2020 to mitigate Brexit-related disruption is now over. Finally, after a fall in 2020 owing to deferred reporting obligations, we expect a rise in bankruptcies this year.
We forecast 1.9% annual average growth in 2023-25. Germany's poor demographic outlook will increasingly constrain potential growth as the working-age population declines, exacerbated by a fall in net immigration during the pandemic. Technological disruption to the automotive sector also represents a structural risk: Germany has been slow to shift emphasis towards electric vehicles. Efforts to reduce supply-chain dependence on China may result in some reshoring of production, but as labour costs in Europe are higher, we do not expect this to result in a surge in job creation. Instead, automation and digitisation will gain pace, and supply-chain linkages with existing suppliers in central and eastern Europe will strengthen.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation Consumer prices rose by just 0.4% in 2020, reflecting low oil prices, the hit to demand from the coronavirus and the cut to the VAT rate in July-December. January 2021 presented a change in trend, with annual inflation rising to 1.6% as a consequence of the end of the VAT cut, new carbon emissions certificates raising transport and heating costs, and a rise in the minimum wage. Annual price growth will remain above the euro zone average in 2021 as a consequence of these changes in administered prices, as well as rising oil prices and a gradual release of pent-up consumer demand as vaccination programmes make progress. This could lead to rising political pressure from Germany regarding the extremely loose monetary policy stance of the ECB. We expect inflation to average 1.8% in 2021, before moderating to an average of 1.6% in 2022-25.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates The euro has experienced high volatility throughout 2020. A depreciation against the US dollar in the early months of the year, when the coronavirus forced European countries into lockdowns, was followed by a rapid appreciation after the EU announced the establishment of a new recovery fund worth EUR750bn. We forecast that the single currency will stabilise at an average of US$1.21:EUR1 in 2021, supported by the ongoing weakness in the US dollar. In 2022 muted inflation and growth prospects in the single-currency area will force the ECB to maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy stance for longer than the Federal Reserve (the US central bank), prompting a slight depreciation of the euro against the dollar. The euro will strengthen from 2023 onwards, supported by the euro zone's structural current-account surplus and the gradual unwinding of the ECB's PEPP.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector Germany's current-account surpluses were the largest in the world in nominal terms in the four years to 2019, and we expect them to be so again from 2021, after temporarily falling below China last year. They are underpinned by huge trade surpluses, reflecting the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector. This will continue to generate large domestic savings that are mainly invested abroad, leading to a solid primary income surplus.
We expect the recession in 2020 to have resulted in a decline in Germany's trade surplus, as the fall in exports outstripped the fall in imports. We estimate the full-year current-account surplus at the equivalent of 6.8% of GDP-down marginally from over 7% in the previous six years. Trade and primary income surpluses will comfortably outweigh narrow structural deficits on the services and secondary income accounts throughout our forecast period. We expect the current-account surplus to recover in nominal terms in 2021, but to remain unchanged as a share of GDP as the economy also expands. In 2022-25 we forecast that the external surplus will average 6.9% of GDP as world trade volumes and investment flows recover.

Full text: - Despite Venezuela's socioeconomic collapse and the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, to retain power throughout the 2021-25 forecast period. Mr Maduro's position will be supported primarily by his grip over a complex security apparatus and the opposition's lack of de facto power. On this basis, we expect continued deterioration of the economy, sustained outward migration, and a poorer and more violent Venezuela. Despite US sanctions (and their impact on oil production), the Maduro regime has managed internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through its strict control over the security forces.
- The scale of the socioeconomic collapse and the elevated level of political instability will ensure that the Maduro regime continues to be challenged both economically and politically. In particular, there is a significant risk of regime change stemming form a possible breakdown in the patronage system that sustains the security forces' support of the regime. Under our baseline forecast, we assume that Mr Maduro will avoid this, as oil revenue should pick up from a trough in 2020. However, there are substantial risks to this assumption, given the scale of operational difficulties and the lack of incentives for investment in the Venezuelan oil industry.
- De facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding. Concurrently, the govern-ment has taken measures that have allowed the official exchange rate to float. These measures have aided price stability and thereby increased the availability of some basic goods. However, the measures are not a product of economic orthodoxy, but of policy decisions to ensure the regime's survival. We do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that will be required to resolve Venezuela's economic crisis within the forecast period.

- Venezuela ranks 82nd out of 82 countries in the global business environ-ment rankings for 2021-25, showing no improvement relative to the 2016-20 historical period. Reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment remain unlikely.

Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Expansion of interventionist measures, including price controls. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and continue to undermine free competition.
2023-25: Contract rights remain weak, and red tape and ad hoc interventionism continue.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Most attempts to attract investment prove unsuccessful, owing to political and economic instability.
2023-25: Investment flows remain low amid ongoing economic volatility. Intellectual property protection and private property rights deteriorate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Currency controls are weakened, but access to foreign currency remains limited.
2023-25: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls taken on a gradual basis, and de facto dollarisation advances. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves as oil prices rise, albeit slowly.
Taxes 2021-22: Risk of further unrest and political instability reduces probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major rise in public spending.
2023-25: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2021-22: Inflation remains high and concerns surrounding economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2023-25: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2021-22: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Past emigration of skilled labour aggravates skills shortages.
2023-25: Labour-market rigidities persist, despite some increase in flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Underinvestment in water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts.
2023-25: Investors remain highly cautious about committing to long-term capital projects. Infrastructure deteriorates even further.
Technological readiness 2021-22: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment, but with little interest.
2023-25: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to restrict internet and mobile coverage.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013 proved unsuccessful. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his own popularity plummet as his macroeconomic mismanagement, combined with strict sanctions on trade from the US, has plunged the country into a severe economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature to be in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly. In December 2020 the PSUV and its allies regained control of the legislature in an election that was widely regarded as rigged.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports, and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$8.6bn in 2019 as a long-term decline in oil exports deepened. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the trade account deteriorated further in 2020, shifting to a deficit of US$995m.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV, the Chavistas), to remain in power throughout the 2021-25 forecast period, despite its failure to stem a long-running socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis. A number of factors underpin our forecast; particularly significant is the regime's strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces. This control-together with a patronage system that rewards the loyalty of high-ranking officials-will allow the regime to manage internal dissent.
Following a sham legislative election in December 2020, in which the Chavistas retook control of the National Assembly, the regime enjoys virtually unchecked control over all the levers of power. Meanwhile, the domestic opposition, led by Juan Guaidó (the former head of the legislature and self-declared interim president), has been left scrambling without a clear path forward, its decision to boycott the December election having left it without a voice in any major government institution. Before it lost control of the National Assembly, the opposition moved to unilaterally extend its mandate by one year. However, with many lawmakers abstaining from the vote out of fear of reprisals from the Maduro regime, and with key international players like the EU no longer recognising Mr Guaidó as the interim president (but rather as the main opposition leader), the opposition's attempt to extend its mandate lacks clear support and legitimacy.
In practice, the fallout from the election changes little in terms of policy-making; Mr Maduro has long used the executive's sweeping powers, as well as his influence over the highly politicised judiciary, to approve his policy agenda. However, retaking control of the National Assembly is significant insofar as it all but erases any threat that the Guaidó-led opposition might pose to Mr Maduro.
There is, nonetheless, a high degree of risk attached to our forecast that Maduro will remain in power. The uncontrolled spread of the corona-virus (Covid-19) disease, diminished oil rents-resulting from severe mismanagement of the sector, and more recently from US sanctions and low international oil prices-and persistent goods shortages all present hefty challenges to the survival of the regime. In our view, there are three main paths to a change of government: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We believe that the prospect of military action by the US or Colombia is low. Notwithstanding efforts by the US to increase multilateral engagement, a negotiated transition would also be difficult, as trust issues between the two sides are insurmountable. Bearing this in mind, we believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The regime's main weakness is the fragility of its internal finances. Its patronage system is crucial for sustaining its security apparatus and resisting social unrest. Low international crude prices, US sanctions and an extremely poor macroeconomic environment will limit the country's ability to draw in US dollar finance. The regime will continue to benefit from funds from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities, but a lack of hard currency could prove fatal to the patronage system and will test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks and control over the security apparatus. The regime's liquidity problems-along with a deepening socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis-could prompt putsch attempts in the near term.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch On December 6th 2020 Venezuela held a legislative election to select the 277 members of the unicameral National Assembly. No international observers oversaw the vote, and both the EU and the US stated that the election was neither free nor fair. According to the National Electoral Council, the results were over-whelmingly in favour of Gran Polo Patriótico (GPP), an electoral alliance dominated by the PSUV. With 69% of the vote, the GPP took control of 256 seats in the 277-member legislature. The results were unsurprising, given that most of the main opposition parties boycotted the election and did not field candidates, but this was far from a ringing endorsement of the regime. According to the electoral authorities, only 31% of registered voters came out to vote, although the opposition claims that turnout was even lower than that. Some opposition parties did contest the election; the Alianza Democrática coalition (composed of five opposition parties) fared best, with 18% of the vote, but only managed to get 20 seats in the legislature.
Next on the electoral calendar is a regional election (to elect governors and state legislative assemblies), due by end-2021. The regional polls will provide the opposition with an opportunity to regroup and change its political strategy. In our view, electoral participation-even under unfair conditions-would be a useful step for the opposition to begin rebuilding political capital. However, even assuming that the opposition makes some inroads in regional govern-ments, it will not significantly alter the balance of power in the near term, but will instead only edge Venezuela towards a slightly more competitive model of authoritarianism.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations The Maduro regime's main foreign policy challenge will centre on managing its combative ties with the US. The administration led by the former US president, Donald Trump (2017-21), instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions as part of a "maximum pressure" campaign designed to undermine the regime's finances (and therefore its patronage system) in order to force Mr Maduro to hold free and fair elections. Although the aggressive sanctions policy did not produce its intended outcome, it did accelerate the decline of Venezuela's oil industry. Mr Maduro will look to reset ties with the US under the current president, Joe Biden, but we expect little progress on this front. US policy towards Venezuela has bipartisan support in that country, and Mr Biden is unlikely to provide significant sanctions relief absent major political compromises and commitments to democratic reforms from the Maduro regime (which remain highly improbable). Any changes to sanctions policy by the US would therefore be only on humanitarian grounds, aimed at improving the lived realities of the poorest Venezuelans. For instance, we expect the Biden administration to reverse course on the recently instated sanctions on crude-for-diesel swaps, which are largely used by the Maduro regime to shore up diesel supplies for power generation, agricultural activity, water pumps and public transport.
Iran has recently become Mr Maduro's main international backer. In 2020 Iran sent more than 2.5m barrels of petrol to Venezuela (in exchange for gold shipments) to alleviate the country's severe fuel shortages. An additional 400,000 barrels have already been sent in the year to date. Iran is also helping PDVSA, the state-owned oil company, to repair the Paraguaná oil refinery.
Venezuela's other major allies, including Russia and China, seem unwilling to provide the financing-amounting to tens of billions of US dollars per year-required to stabilise the economy and secure PDVSA's long-term future. Mr Maduro has openly courted both countries but has had little success in securing finance for investment.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends The Maduro regime's immediate policy priorities will be to contain the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak and to halt a long-running economic collapse. In order to address the community spread of Covid-19, in January the regime reintroduced the "Fórmula 7+7 Plus" strategy, which involves alternating between a week of tighter restrictions (when non-essential shops and services are closed) and a week of more relaxed restrictions (when those businesses may open). However, we do not expect that this approach will prevent Venezuela's decrepit medical infrastructure from being overwhelmed. The regime has also signed an agreement with Russia to procure enough of its Sputnik V vaccine to inoculate 10m people (about a third of the population) in a first-phase rollout scheduled to begin in the first half of 2021. However, fuel shortages, bureaucratic inefficiencies and weak medical capacities will delay the rollout. As such, we do not expect that enough doses of the vaccine will be distributed to have a significant impact on local transmission until 2023.
Addressing the long-running economic decline will be a similarly difficult task. Mr Maduro will continue a process of gradual economic liberalisation in order to draw in private investment. In October 2020 the regime promulgated an anti-blockade law, which gives the executive branch the unchecked authority to sign confidential new deals with private firms and countries (in a bid to skirt international sanctions). In November 2020 the regime used the law to sell Agropatria, a state-owned agricultural firm, to Grupo Agrollano, a private company of unknown origin. We expect that the regime will similarly seek to reprivatise a number of other businesses that had been expropriated by Mr Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chávez (1999-2013), but were run aground by cronyism and mismanagement. The regime will also encourage greater private-sector participation in the oil industry, but it will refrain from outright privatisation of PDVSA. These efforts, however, are unlikely to yield significant results; even assuming that the regime is able to get around financial sanctions, it will struggle to attract new investment, given the abysmal business environ-ment and the lack of confidence in the rule of law.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy The authorities have not published complete data on fiscal accounts since 2011. However, we expect that a high level of inefficient current expenditure, combined with an extremely weak revenue intake, will keep the budget deficit wide and the public debt/GDP ratio astronomical throughout the forecast period. The sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will curb government spending. The regime relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving extremely high inflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Money printing will continue to finance the government's deficits in 2021-25. The sovereign is in arrears on virtually all of its interest and principal repayments, and we do not expect any debt restructuring in 2021-25. Moreover, the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing-mainly PDVSA-issued debt and development funds from China-understates the true size of total public liabilities.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy Monetary policy will remain subservient to fiscal policy, as the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) continues to print money to finance the government's gaping budget deficits. The BCV has, in recent years, taken steps to control growth of monetary aggregates. For instance, in early 2019 it lifted the cash reserve ratio (CRR) to 100%; although it has relaxed the CRR slightly since that peak, as at January it remained at an extremely high 85%. Moreover, far from taming inflation, these measures have only led to the complete destruction of private-sector credit (the latest data show that the stock of private-sector credit contracted by 30% year on year in October).
These factors have accelerated the use of US dollars in the economy. According to private-sector estimates, two-thirds of all financial transactions are now made in US dollars. This is likely to rise further, following Mr Maduro's January announcement that banks would be authorised to expand the use of foreign-currency bank accounts. The Maduro regime has even allowed private companies to issue debt in hard currency in order to raise finance; in November 2020, Ron Santa Teresa became the first company in more than two decades to issue dollar-denominated bonds (worth US$300,000) on the Caracas Stock Exchange. Although progress will be gradual, we believe that Venezuela is ultimately headed towards overall de facto dollarisation.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 30.3% in 2020 (and a cumulative contraction of almost 77% since 2013), we forecast an additional 3.7% decline in GDP in 2021. On the supply side, GDP is now strongly correlated with oil production. Having plummeted to an average of 500,000 barrels/day in 2020-its lowest level in several decades-crude production should stabilise in 2021 as global energy demand starts to recover. However, there are several downside risks to this benign assumption. In particular, low crude prices will continue to threaten production. At present, Venezuela's average break-even price is about US$15-20/barrel. However, US sanctions on the regime raise the risks involved in dealing with Venezuela, forcing the country to offer a hefty discount on its crude. This means that, at current market prices, Venezuela is making only a limited profit (its oil basket traded at an estimated US$33/b in December 2020). As a result, there are currently no active drill rigs in Venezuela. Meanwhile, the non-oil economy will fare little better, especially as an uncontrolled pandemic limits prospects for services activities. On the demand side, both investment and consumption will languish as a result of rampant inflation, weak consumer and business sentiment and a lack of access to finance. Real exports will see some improvement at the margins but will remain hampered by weak domestic productive capacities.
In 2022 we expect economic growth to return on the back of a surge in oil prices. Despite serious operational problems (such as difficulties in obtaining equipment for repairs and finding qualified staff) and a limited pool of suitable buyers of Venezuelan crude, oil output will recover partially in the medium term as producers adapt to post-sanctions export markets. Furthermore, relative macroeconomic stability-driven primarily by an expansion of dollarisation-will allow the non-oil economy to recover marginally in the medium term. Nonetheless, we assume that Venezuela's GDP (in real terms) will be only about half of its 2018 level, even in 2025.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation A severely reduced domestic goods supply, constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits will impede the disinflationary process in 2021-25. The regime has shown little inclination to take on the fiscal and macroeconomic reforms that would address the root causes of inflation. It has, however, lent its support to an ongoing process of de facto dollarisation, which will help to ease price pressures over time.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates Strong inflationary pressures will sustain bolívar depreciation in 2021. Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency denomination (as in March 2018) or a new currency is a strong possibility. Even though a number of currency regulations officially remain on the books, the regime has largely stopped enforcing them in its recent embrace of dollar-isation. Although a black market for US dollars continues to operate, the premium is modest compared with previous years. On February 2nd the black-market exchange rate stood at BsS1,800,137:US$1, only marginally above the official exchange rate of BsS1,787,970:US$1.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector Balance-of-payments pressures will remain severe throughout the forecast period, contributing to goods shortages and economic inequities. According to the BCV, foreign reserves closed 2020 at US$6.4bn-their lowest level in three decades. The steep decline in reserves, which has been several years in the making, reflects poor policymaking and a lack of economic diversification in the country's external sector.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect reserves to rise modestly over the forecast period, reaching US$7.6bn by end-2025. We expect this result to be driven entirely by trends on the current account, as Venezuela's access to foreign capital will remain extremely limited. We expect the current-account balance to shift from an estimated deficit of 3.2% of GDP in 2020 to a surplus of 0.5% of GDP in 2021. Thereafter, it will remain in surplus, averaging 1.8% of GDP in 2022-25. Our forecast rests on the assumption that export earnings will pick up from a nadir in 2020 as international oil prices recover and the country steps up trade with new markets in Asia. We also expect that workers' remittances from abroad will play a crucial role in propping up the current-account balance, as Venezuelan emigrants are gradually absorbed into the labour markets in their host countries.

Full text: - The right-wing government of the president, Jair Bolsonaro, has built a loose alliance with centrist parties in order to bolster governability in Brazil's highly fragmented Congress, as well as to advance his economic reform and socially conservative agenda. Tensions with the judiciary will simmer as the authorities investigate the affairs of the president's sons.
- Economic policymaking will be guided by the need to return to fiscal sustainability after stimulus in 2020 on the back of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the fiscal deficit widened to an estimated 15.8% of GDP in 2020, lifting the public debt/GDP ratio to nearly 100% by 2021. Assuming recovery and consolidation thereafter, we then expect this ratio to stabilise.
- The economy is recovering since activity hit its lowest point in April (at the height of lockdown restrictions). GDP is estimated to have fallen by 4.4% in 2020, and will recover partially in 2021, growing by 3.2%. GDP growth will average 2% annually in 2022-25. Despite policy accommodation, Brazil's productive capacity will be damaged by the crisis, impairing medium-term potential growth.
- Inflation will ease from 4.5% in 2020 as a surge in food prices eases, and the rate will fluctuate around the declining mid-point target (3.75% in 2021, 3.5% in 2022 and 3.25% in 2023) over the medium term.
- The Real will continue to strengthen from R5.3:US$1 currently to about R4.6:US$1 by 2025, with the start to interest-rate normalisation before mid-2021 lifting interest-rate differentials. Assuming a recovery in imports, the current-account deficit will widen to 3.6% by 2025.
- Following recession in 2020, a projected recovery will expand Brazil's large domestic market above US$2trn by 2025. Notwithstanding some simplifications, the tax system will remain burdensome and will be one of the weakest areas of the business environment. Infrastructure investment through a concessions prog-ramme will help to ease logistical bottlenecks, but upgrades and extensions will materialise only slowly.

- Fiscal consolidation needs after hefty stimulus during the coronavirus pandemic and the 2022 electoral cycle will complicate government efforts to improve the business environment and enact structural reforms. Brazil's large economy is attractive, but poor government effectiveness, a burdensome tax system, archaic infrastructure, deficiencies in factor markets and skills shortages will impair business.

Country forecast overview: Brazil's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic delays privatisations of several state-owned subsidiaries, but parent companies require legislative approval, blocking divestments. Partial privatisation of Eletrobras, the state-owned energy firm, is possible.
2023-25: Privatisations continue. Fiscal pressures encourage private capital in infrastructure projects. Investment Partner-ships Programme (PPI) advances further, with improved legal framework and regulatory agencies.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Pandemic hits foreign direct investment (FDI). Changes to "pre-salt" oil auction rules and PPI attracts FDI.
2023-25: Brazil's OECD accession boosts foreign investment. Ideological issues within current government put nationalist politics ahead of economic pragmatism in certain situations.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: EU-Mercosul deal not expected to be ratified by EU parliaments.
2023-25: Steps taken to make Real a fully convertible currency.
Taxes 2021-22: Post-coronavirus consolidation needs may lead to higher taxes.
2023-25: Tax simplification unifies three federal, state and municipal taxes into one value-added tax (VAT).
Financing 2021-22: Financial system weathers pandemic; Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank) provides emergency credit. BCB gains independence, improving efficiency and competitiveness, reducing borrowing costs. Credit resumes after crisis.
2023-25: Renewed growth in domestic equity and bond issuance as state banks dial back subsidised credit lines.
The labour market 2021-22: Unemployment surges owing to pandemic. Government implements further measures to reduce cost of labour.
2023-25: Steps to boost long-term labour productivity complicated by continued weak education policies.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Infrastructure concessions advance (through PPI), but coronavirus, and political and institutional constraints may cause delays. Corruption and recession weigh on established construction companies, opening industry up for newcomers.
2023-25: Industry newcomers' lack of experience causes project delays.
Technological readiness 2021-22: Fifth-generation (5G) frequencies to be auctioned in 2021. Quality of communications rises as demand expands.
2023-25: Building of 5G infrastructure network commences and is rolled out to consumers.

Background: A new constitution was ratified in 1988 after more than 20 years of military rule. The government of Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995-2002) ended hyperinflation and advanced reforms to liberalise the economy. Under a former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-10), Brazil reaped the benefits of the reforms and enjoyed a consumer-led, commodities-fuelled boom. When this cycle ended, discontent owing to a weak economy, corruption and poor public services led to street protests. Lula's successor as president, Dilma Rousseff (2011-16), nonetheless won a second four-year term in 2014, but was impeached in 2016 over budget irregularities. Her vice-president, Michel Temer (2016-18), finished her term. Jair Bolsonaro won the October 2018 election and took office as president in January 2019.
Political structure: The president executes policy approved by the 513-seat Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and the 81-seat Senate (the upper house). Constitutional review is conducted by an independent judiciary. Although the president can resort to temporary decrees to push through legislation, the constitution gives Congress ample scope to check the executive. In the lower house, 30 political parties are represented and party discipline has traditionally been weak.
Policy issues: The benefits and entitlements established under the 1988 constitution have contributed to a doubling in central government primary spending, to over 27% of GDP. Congress passed a federal spending cap in 2016 and a robust pension reform in October 2019. The Banco Central do Brasil (the central bank) cut the Selic policy rate to 2% in August, a record low. The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic is leading to expansionary fiscal, monetary and credit policies to offset the hit to the economy and financial system, lifting public debt/GDP above 95%.
Taxation: Brazil has a poorly structured revenue system, characterised by a heavy tax burden, a narrow tax base, complicated levies and widespread evasion. Both foreign and domestic companies employ tax professionals and devote considerable resources to managing their tax affairs. The corporate and indirect tax systems are particularly complex, porous and unwieldy; the income tax system is considered to be relatively efficient, with a top rate of 27.5%.
Foreign trade: The coronavirus-induced recession and a weaker currency are narrowing the current-account deficit, which is an estimated 0.8% of GDP in 2020. Agricultural exports support a moderate structural trade surplus.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability The political environment in 2021 will be shaped by the deployment of coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccines and the efforts of the right-wing, populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, to consolidate his alliances with the centrão, a group of centrist parties that hold the key to control of Congress. Their support-in exchange for political favours, including govern-ment posts and budget allocations-will help the president to advance his socially conservative agenda and ward off potential impeachment risks, but will reduce impetus for market reforms espoused by his free-market economy minister, Paulo Guedes. Impeachment risks have subsided after emerging in 2020 as a result of the president's confrontational rhetoric against Congress and the Supreme Court, but could re-emerge given his poor handling of the pandemic and as politicians seek to undermine his probable October 2022 re-election bid. Nonetheless, the president will continue to face challenges from more progressive centre-right parties that aim to secure the leadership of the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) under Baleia Rossi, the president of the Movimento Democrático Brasileiro (MDB) party, in the February leadership election.
Mr Bolsonaro's popularity got a boost in 2020 from emergency cash payments, but the effect has already started to wear off in January, after the relief programme ended. According to XP/Ipespe, a local pollster, Mr Bolsonaro's rejection ratings rose to 40% in January, from 35% in December 2020, while his approval fell to 32% from 38%, returning to pre-pandemic levels. Looking ahead, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Mr Bolsonaro to try to retain the support of his core conservative voters and of his new-found lower-income voters (particularly in the populous north-east) to boost his re-election chances, but he will struggle to do so in the short term. Retaining the support of low-income voters will largely depend on additional economic stimulus, which, even if passed, would see its scope reduced given limited fiscal space. To rally his right-wing supporters, Mr Bolsonaro will seek to push forward his conservative "customs" agenda items, although his ability to do so will largely hinge on the election of Arthur Lira of the Progressistas party as speaker, who will be more favourable to this agenda than Mr Rossi, who depends on support from the left in Congress.
Mr Bolsonaro's proximity to the military (he is a retired army captain) has fuelled tension, especially with the judiciary. Although we expect calm relations for the time being, tensions could resurface given the president's impetuous nature and investigations into both him (relating to alleged political interference in the federal police in 2020) and his sons, Carlos (a local councillor, involved in "fake news" campaigns against political opponents) and Flávio (a senator, implicated in a local assembly graft scheme). Not only has the president put retired military officers in important cabinet positions-including Hamilton Mourão as vice-president-and stacked lower-ranking officials in the state bureaucracy, but in early 2020 he also actively supported bolsonaristas who attacked opponents in Congress (as well as in the judiciary and media) and called for military intervention. However, a rupture of constitutional rule is unlikely, as voters would protest; polls suggest that 75% of Brazilians support democracy as the best form of government. In addition, most high-ranking military officials are reluctant to be closely associated with Mr Bolsonaro.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch The November local elections boosted traditional centrist parties, suggesting that, regardless of their opinions of Mr Bolsonaro, voters are unlikely to elect a left-leaning president in October 2022. The field for the presidential race will again be large, but it looks likely to be a close re-run of the 2018 vote, with Mr Bolsonaro probably backed by the centrão-competing against whomever a former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-10), nominates as the Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT) candidate. This assumes that Lula, who was convicted of corruption, does not unexpectedly become eligible to stand. The PT performed poorly in the local elections and leftist parties are unlikely to unite behind a single candidate, which could reduce the chances of the PT candidate (or other emerging leftist rivals) contesting a probable second-round run-off. The surprise factor could come from a centre-right candidate such as João Doria, the governor of São Paulo state, but this third way could suffer a similar fate as the left if it fails to unite. Notwithstanding the advantages of incumbency, a strong centre-right could present a tougher contest for Mr Bolsonaro in a run-off, as the president would not be able to capitalise on anti-PT sentiment as he did in 2018. It is too early to make a call; Mr Bolsonaro's standing could be affected by unexpected developments in Brazil's tumultuous political environment.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations The president's anti-globalist rhetoric and facilitation of illegal deforestation in the Amazon rainforest is tarnishing Brazil's international standing. However, as one of the world's ten largest economies and a major commodity exporter, Brazil will remain a significant global player. Under the presidency of Joe Biden in the US, bilateral relations will be cooler while Mr Bolsonaro is president given their divergent stances, particularly regarding climate change and deforest-ation. The relationship has made a bumpy start, as Mr Bolsonaro was the last major world leader to congratulate Mr Biden, but we assume that a pragmatic approach will prevail, with common ground on anti-Chinese sentiment.
Brazil will remain one of the battlegrounds in US-China rivalry; a fifth-generation (5G) licence auction scheduled for 2021 will prove tricky for the government given the local presence of Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications company. Anti-Chinese rhetoric by nationalist government figures is causing bilateral tensions, but military figures will encourage the president to be pragmatic regarding China's acquisition of assets, as Brazil needs investments in major infrastructure and energy projects. Moreover, Brazil's reliance on the Chinese coronavirus vaccine, Sinovac, will also temper the government's anti-Chinese rhetoric. We do not expect a free-trade agreement (FTA) between the EU and Mercosul (the Southern Cone customs union comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) to be ratified soon, owing to EU concerns over Mr Bolsonaro's environmental policies. Now that there is also pressure from Mr Biden on environmental issues, Brazil's efforts to join the OECD face delays.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends Policymaking in 2021 will focus on the Covid-19 vaccine rollout and the government's structural reform agenda, which was overshadowed by the pandemic. However, some initiatives will be limited by a need to return to fiscal sustainability and the dialling-down of emergency stimulus. At the same time there is growing pressure from legislatures to extend emergency cash payments that ended in December. Overall, we expect the government to make only piecemeal progress on its agenda, as Mr Bolsonaro's commitment to reforms and to fiscal consolidation appears to be waning; he is prioritising his alliance with centrão parties (which resist Mr Guedes's more ambitious free-market reforms) and his 2022 re-election bid.
The government will focus primarily on passing revenue-neutral tax simplification reforms to unify three or more consumption taxes into a single value-added tax (VAT); Mr Guedes has almost given up on his efforts to levy a new, 0.2% digital payments tax to finance a reduction in payroll costs amid widespread congressional resistance. The government will attempt to make progress on other structural reforms-including streamlining the public sector, bringing greater order and flexibility to budget management, and privatisations. There is a small window of opportunity between the February Congressional leadership elections and mid-2021 to press on with any reforms before attention turns to the 2022 elections; we expect a broadly revenue-neutral tax simplification reform, possibly including changes to tax rates.
Overshadowing policymaking will be the need to consolidate the public finances, given the high and rising public debt/GDP ratio (88% in November 2020) and increasing fears in financial markets that the government could breach its constitutionally mandated public spending cap. Policymakers deployed huge fiscal stimulus in 2020 (about 8% of GDP directly, and even more including below-the-line items and government guarantees) to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, including monthly cash transfers of R600 (US$115) to more than 60m informal workers until September (dialled down to R300 until end-2020). Although Mr Bolsonaro signalled that extending the transfers into 2021 was on the table (as they had buoyed his popularity), the programme ended in 2020 as planned. Instead, the government will study expanding the existing Bolsa Família welfare programme, which is much smaller in scale, as it benefits about 20m people compared with the more than 65m people reached by emergency relief. Negotiations on the expansion will begin after the February congressional elections. In this context, risks that the spending cap will be breached have subsided for now, but (although this is not currently our baseline forecast) there is a chance that debt-sustainability concerns could return if the expansion plans are not aligned with the fiscal rules, especially as the 2022 elections near and social pressure will increase if there is a significant deterioration in the public health crisis.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy After surging to an estimated 95% in 2020 due to pandemic-related support measures, currency depreciation and recession, the public debt/GDP ratio will grow to 96% in 2021 as fiscal revenue only partly recovers. Stopping a more substantial rise will require consolidation; otherwise, concerns about debt sustainability will re-emerge among investors, raising the country risk premium. The government will avoid raising taxes ahead of the 2022 election, but tax increases thereafter cannot be ruled out. The "state of calamity" approved by Congress amid the pandemic allowed the government to sidestep constitution-ally mandated fiscal rules in 2020 and increase spending, but an extension of this in 2021 (a growing possibility, albeit not currently our baseline forecast) would unnerve investors. The fiscal hit from the crisis is apparent in the widening of the 12-month rolling overall deficit, to 13.1% of GDP in November 2020. We expect measures to be mostly removed in 2021; the deficit will narrow to 7.3% of GDP as revenue increases. Consolidation of these trends will narrow the deficit to less than 6% of GDP on average in 2022-25. We anticipate that public debt will stabilise within the forecast period, helped by privatisation proceeds and currency revaluation, but there is a growing risk that debt will exceed 100% if the president yields to an election-related increase in spending.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy As the economy recovers during 2021-25, we expect policy normalisation, beginning by the second quarter, to take the Selic policy rate from 2% currently to 5.5% by 2023 (a real interest rate of 2-3%, which we consider to be neutral, up from over -2% currently). The mid-point inflation target will fall by 25 basis points each year in 2021-23, from 3.75% to 3.25% in 2023 (the 2024 target will be set in 2021 and could fall further). The most significant risk to the environment of low interest rates and inflation is an unexpected abandonment of the spending cap rules, which could trigger a market sell-out that may force the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank) to tighten policy sooner, and by more than expected. We expect the BCB to gain formal independence in early 2021 as the legislative agenda gets back on track after the congressional leadership elections.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth Following an estimated 4.4% contraction in 2020, real GDP will recover partly in 2021, expanding by 3.2%, assuming that major corona-virus lockdowns are avoided. However, growth in 2021 will be mostly due to strong statistical effects from the 2020 rebound, and sequential growth will be quite weak owing to the withdrawal of most fiscal stimulus. Although low interest rates and inflation will be supportive factors (along with a recovering global economy), lasting damage to the productive sector and jobs, and to corporate and household balance sheets, means that we do not expect output to return to pre-coronavirus levels until 2022. The rebound in the third quarter of 2020 (7.7% quarter on quarter) slowed in the fourth quarter (to an estimated 2.4%) as income transfers were dialled down. We now expect growth to contract in the first quarter of 2021 as cash transfers end and amid a deteriorating public health crisis, and to be limited in the second quarter, with a gradual pick-up thereafter, boosted by mass availability of Covid-19 vaccines during the second half of the year. Our forecasts assume the approval of tax simplification reforms and progress on other microeconomic reform agenda items, but we recognise that governability risks could hamper advances.
On the demand side, the upturn in 2021-25 will be driven by stronger investment (buoyed by lower interest rates, privatisations and infrastructure concessions) and by private consumption, supported by lower interest rates and credit growth. The withdrawal of emergency cash transfers in 2021 will initially be offset by the use of household savings (which rose in 2020) until the jobs market strengthens later in the year. On the supply side, commodity exports will accelerate in 2021-25, in line with a recovery in global demand. Manu-facturing has already rebounded owing to stimulus for consumers and a weaker currency, which could continue to make goods more competitive against imports in 2021-25. Positive vaccine news should boost consumer and business confidence, but the recovery of services sectors will not fully materialise until successful deployment of a vaccine beyond vulnerable groups from mid-2021.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation A stronger policy framework than in the past will help to anchor inflation expectations, and minimum-wage increases are unlikely to be much above infla-tion (if at all). There is a risk that inflation expectations will become unanchored if pandemic-induced fiscal expansion is unexpectedly not brought under control. We consider that the recent rise in inflation (4.5% at end-2020)-related to higher food and commodity prices, as well as a weaker currency and higher demand created by emergency cash transfers-will be transitory. Assuming a gradual economic recovery in 2021-25, and barring periodic weather-related food shortages, an unexpected surge in oil prices or fiscal slippage, inflation should fluctuate close to the (lower) mid-point targets for 2021 (3.75%), 2022 (3.5%) and 2023 (3.25%). The 2024 target will be set in mid-2021 and could fall to 3%.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates Swings in global conditions and jitters over fiscal risks will keep the Real volatile, but it should continue to regain some of its 2020 losses over the medium term. The Real made gains in late 2020 as coronavirus-induced risk aversion eased, and ended at R5.2:US$1-about 22% weaker than at end-2019, although it is facing renewed depreciation pressures at the start of 2021 amid deteriorating economic expectations and market jitters over fiscal risks. We expect the Real to strengthen to R4.6:US$1 by 2025, fluctuating in line with Brazil's terms of trade, interest-rate differentials and global risk sentiment. A deeper local capital market for long-term debt will discourage corporate external borrowing, reducing capital inflows. The main forecast risk is the possibility of a market sell-off if confidence in debt sustainability evaporates.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector Risks to Brazil's external position will be assuaged by its modest current-account deficit and external debt ratios, comfortable reserves cushion and a Real no longer overvalued by high interest rates (as in the past). Public external debt is low, and most companies have some sort of currency hedge, despite moderate private external debt. The trade balance will post a large structural surplus during 2021-25, owing to stable commodity exports to China, but this will narrow gradually as imports rise following recession-related compression in 2020.
After narrowing in 2020, the current-account deficit will widen gradually during 2021-25 as imports recover in line with the economy, and will exceed 3.5% of GDP by 2025. After dropping to an estimated 3.6% of GDP in 2020, inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) will average 4% of GDP in 2021-25, reflecting sizeable market opportunities.

Full text: - Despite Venezuela's socioeconomic collapse and the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, to retain power throughout the 2021-25 forecast period. Mr Maduro's position will be supported primarily by his grip over a complex security apparatus and the opposition's lack of de facto power. On this basis, we expect continued deterioration of the economy, sustained outward migration, and a poorer and more violent Venezuela. Despite US sanctions (and their impact on oil production), the Maduro regime has managed internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through its strict control over the security forces.
- The scale of the socioeconomic collapse and the elevated level of political instability will ensure that the Maduro regime continues to be challenged both economically and politically. In particular, there is a significant risk of regime change stemming form a possible breakdown in the system of patronage that sustains the security forces' support of the regime. Under our baseline forecast, we expect Mr Maduro to avoid such an outcome, as oil revenues pick up from a low in 2020. However, there are substantial risks to this assumption, given the scale of operational difficulties and the lack of incentives for investment in the Venezuelan oil industry.
- De facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding. Concurrently, the government has taken measures that have allowed the official exchange rate to float. These measures have to date aided price stability and therefore increased the availability of some basic goods. However, the measures are not a product of economic orthodoxy, but of policy decisions to ensure the regime's survival. We do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that will be required to resolve Venezuela's economic crisis within the forecast period.

- Venezuela ranks 82nd out of 82 countries in the global business environ-ment rankings for 2021-25, showing no improvement relative to the 2016-20 historical period. Reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment remain unlikely.

Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Expansion of interventionist measures, including price controls. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and continue to undermine free competition.
2023-25: Contract rights remain weak, and red tape and ad hoc interventionism continue.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Most attempts to attract investment prove unsuccessful, owing to political and economic instability.
2023-25: Actual investment flows remain low amid ongoing economic volatility. Intellectual property protection and private property rights deteriorate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Currency controls are weakened, but access to foreign currency remains limited.
2023-25: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, and de facto dollarisation advances. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves as oil prices rise, albeit slowly.
Taxes 2021-22: Risk of further unrest and political instability reduces probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major rise in public spending.
2023-25: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2021-22: Inflation remains high and concerns surrounding economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2023-25: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2021-22: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Past emigration of skilled labour aggravates skills shortages.
2023-25: Labour-market rigidities persist, despite some increase in flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Underinvestment in water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts.
2023-25: Investors remain highly cautious about committing to long-term capital projects. Infrastructure deteriorates even further.
Technological readiness 2021-22: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment, but with little interest.
2023-25: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to restrict internet and mobile coverage.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013 proved unsuccessful. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his own popularity plummet as his macroeconomic mismanagement, combined with strict sanctions on trade from the US, has plunged the country into a severe economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature to be in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly. In December 2020 the PSUV and its allies regained control of the legislature in elections that were widely regarded as rigged.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country, has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports, and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$20.9bn in 2018 as the destruction of domestic supply led to increasing import dependence. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the 2019 current-account surplus was 7.7% of GDP.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV, the Chavistas), to remain in power throughout the 2021-25 forecast period, despite its failure to stem a long-running socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis. A number of factors underpin our forecast, key among which is the regime's strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces. This control-together with a patronage system that rewards the loyalty of high-ranking officials-will allow the regime to manage internal dissent.
Following sham legislative elections in December 2020, in which the Chavistas retook control of the National Assembly, the regime enjoys virtually unchecked control over all the levers of power. The domestic opposition, meanwhile, has been left scrambling without a clear path forward. Its decision to boycott the December polls has left it without a voice in any key government institutions. Before it lost control of the National Assembly, the opposition, led by Juan Guaidó (former head of the legislature and self-declared interim president) moved to unilaterally extend its mandate by one year. However, with many lawmakers abstaining from the vote out of fear of reprisals from the Maduro regime, and with key international players like the EU no longer recognising Mr Guaidó as the interim president, but rather as the main opposition leader, the opposition's move lacks clear support and legitimacy.
In practice, the fallout from the elections changes little in terms of policy-making; Mr Maduro has long used the executive's sweeping powers, as well as the creation of the Constituent Assembly (ANC, a quasi-legislative body), to approve his policy agenda. However, retaking control of the National Assembly is significant insofar as it all but erases any threat that the Guaidó-led opposition might pose to Mr Maduro.
There is, however, a high degree of risk attached to our forecast. The corona-virus (Covid-19) outbreak continuing uncontrolled, diminished oil rents-resulting from severe mismanagement of the sector, and more recently from US sanctions and low international oil prices-and persistent goods shortages all present hefty challenges to the survival of the regime. In our view, there are three main paths to a change of government: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We believe that the prospect of military action by the US or Colombia is low. Notwithstanding efforts by the US to increase multilateral engagement, a negotiated transition would also be difficult, as trust issues between the two sides are insurmountable. Bearing this in mind, we believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The regime's main weakness is the fragility of its internal finances. Its patronage system is crucial for sustaining its security apparatus and resisting social unrest. Low international crude prices, US sanctions and an extremely poor macroeconomic environment will limit the country's ability to draw in US dollar finance. The regime will continue to benefit from funds from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities, but a lack of hard currency could prove fatal to the patronage system and will test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks and control over the security apparatus. The regime's liquidity problems-along with a deepening socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis-could prompt putsch attempts in the near term.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch On December 6th 2020 Venezuela held legislative elections to select the 277 members of the unicameral National Assembly. No international observers oversaw the poll, and both the EU and the US stated that the election was neither free nor fair. According to the National Electoral Council, the results were over-whelmingly in favour of Gran Polo Patriótico (GPP), an electoral alliance dominated by the PSUV. With 69% of the vote, the GPP took control of 256 seats in the 277-member legislature. The results were unsurprising, given that most of the main opposition parties boycotted the election and did not field candidates, but this was far from a ringing endorsement of the regime. According to the electoral authorities, only 31% of registered voters came out to vote, although the opposition claims that turnout was even lower than this. Some opposition parties did contest the election; the Alianza Democrática coalition (comprised of five opposition parties) fared best, with 18% of the vote, but only managed to get 20 seats in the legislature.
The next polls will be state and local elections, which are due by end-2021. These elections will provide the opposition with an opportunity to regroup and change its political strategy. In our view, electoral participation, even under unfair conditions, would be a useful step for the opposition to begin rebuilding political capital. However, even assuming that the opposition makes some inroads in regional governments, it will not significantly alter the balance of power in the near term, but will instead only edge Venezuela towards a slightly more competitive model of authoritarianism.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations The Maduro regime's main foreign policy challenge will centre on managing its combative ties with the US. The administration led by the outgoing US president, Donald Trump, instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions as part of a "maximum pressure" campaign designed to undermine the regime's finances (and therefore its patronage system) in order to force Mr Maduro to hold free and fair elections. Although the aggressive sanctions policy did not produce its intended outcome, it did accelerate the decline of Venezuela's oil industry. Mr Maduro will look to reset ties with the US under the administration of the incoming president, Joe Biden, but we expect little progress on this front. US policy towards Venezuela has bipartisan support in that country and Mr Biden is unlikely to provide significant sanctions relief absent major political compromises and commitments to democratic reforms from the Maduro regime (which remain highly improbable). Any changes to sanctions policy by the US would therefore be only on humanitarian grounds, aimed at improving the lived realities of the poorest Venezuelans. For instance, we expect the Biden administration to reverse course on the recently instated sanctions on "crude-for-diesel" swaps, which are largely used by the Maduro regime to shore up diesel supplies for power generation, agricultural activity, water pumps and public transport.
Iran has recently become Mr Maduro's main international backer. In 2020 Iran sent more than 2.5m barrels of petrol to Venezuela (in exchange for gold shipments) to alleviate the country's severe fuel shortages; more tankers are set to arrive in the coming weeks. Iran is also helping PDVSA, the state-owned oil company, to repair the Paraguaná oil refinery.
Venezuela's other key allies, including Russia and China, seem unwilling to provide the financing-amounting to tens of billions of US dollars per year-required to stabilise the economy and secure PDVSA's long-term future. Mr Maduro has openly courted both countries, but has had little success in securing finance for investment. Although Russia and China will remain key destinations for Venezuelan crude oil, exports to those countries will largely constitute repayments on previous debt already owed to the two nations.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends The Maduro regime's immediate policy priorities will be to contain the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak and to halt a long-running economic collapse. In order to address the former, in January the regime reintroduced the "Fórmula 7+7 Plus" strategy, which involves alternating between a week of tighter restrictions (when non-essential shops and services are closed) and a week of more relaxed restrictions (when those businesses may open), so as to contain community spread of the infection. However, we do not expect that this approach will prevent Venezuela's decrepit medical infrastructure from being overwhelmed. The regime has also signed an agreement with Russia to procure enough of its Sputnik V vaccine to inoculate 10m people (about a third of the population) in a first-phase rollout scheduled to begin in the first half of 2021. However, fuel shortages, bureaucratic inefficiencies and weak medical capacities will delay the rollout. As such, we do not expect that enough doses of the vaccine will be provided to have a significant impact on local transmission until 2022 at the earliest.
Addressing the long-running economic decline will similarly be an uphill task. Mr Maduro will continue a process of gradual economic liberalisation in order to draw in private investment. In October 2020 the regime promulgated the so-called anti-blockade law, which gives the executive branch the unchecked authority to sign confidential new deals with private firms and countries (in a bid to skirt international sanctions). In November 2020 the regime used the law to sell Agropatria, a state-owned agricultural firm, to Grupo Agrollano, a private company of unknown origin. We expect that the regime will similarly seek to reprivatise a number of other businesses that had been expropriated by Mr Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chávez (1999-2013), but were run aground by cronyism and mismanagement. The regime will also encourage greater private-sector participation in the oil industry, but it will refrain from outright privatisation of PDVSA. These efforts, however, are unlikely to yield significant results; even assuming that the regime is able to get around financial sanctions, it will struggle to attract new investment, given the abysmal business environment and the lack of confidence in the rule of law.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy The authorities have not published complete data on fiscal accounts since 2011. However, we expect that a high level of inefficient current expenditure combined with an extremely weak revenue intake will keep the budget deficit wide and the public debt/GDP ratio astronomical throughout the forecast period. The sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will curb government spending. The regime relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving extremely high inflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Money printing will continue to finance the government's deficits in 2021-25. The sovereign is in arrears on virtually all of its interest and principal repayments and we do not expect any debt restructuring in 2021-25. Moreover, the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing-mainly PDVSA-issued debt and development funds from China-understates the true size of total public liabilities.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy Monetary policy will remain subservient to fiscal policy, as the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) continues to print money to finance the government's gaping budget deficits. The BCV has, in recent years, taken some steps to control growth of monetary aggregates. For instance, the ordinary reserve ratio and the marginal reserve ratio both stand at an astounding 93%. However, far from taming inflation, these measures have only led to the destruction of private-sector credit.
These factors have accelerated the use of US dollars in the economy. According to private-sector estimates, two-thirds of all financial transactions are now made in US dollars. This is likely to rise further, following Mr Maduro's January announcement that banks would be authorised to expand the use of foreign-currency bank accounts. The Maduro regime has even allowed private companies to issue debt in hard currency in order to raise finance; in November 2020, Ron Santa Teresa became the first company in more than two decades to issue dollar-denominated bonds (worth US$300,000) on the Caracas Stock Exchange. Although progress will be gradual, we believe that Venezuela is ultimately headed towards overall de facto dollarisation.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 30.3% in 2020 (and a cumulative contraction of almost 77% since 2013), we forecast an additional 1.8% decline in GDP in 2021. On the supply side, GDP is now strongly correlated with oil production. After having plummeted to an average of 560,000 barrels/day in 2020-its lowest level in several decades-we expect crude production to stabilise in 2021 as global energy demand starts to recover. However, there are several downside risks to this benign assumption. In particular, low crude prices will continue to threaten production. At present, Venezuela's average break-even price is about US$15-20/barrel. However, US sanctions on the regime raise the risks involved in dealing with Venezuela, forcing the country to offer a hefty discount on its crude. This means that, at current market prices, Venezuela is making only a limited profit (its oil basket traded at an estimated US$27/b as at November 2020). As a result, there are currently no active drill rigs in Venezuela. Meanwhile, the non-oil economy will fare little better, especially as an uncontrolled pandemic limits prospects for services activities. On the demand side, both investment and consumption will languish as a result of rampant inflation, weak consumer and business sentiment and a lack of access to finance. Real exports will see some improvement at the margins, but will remain hampered by weak domestic productive capacities.
In 2022 we expect economic growth to return on the back of a surge in oil prices. Despite serious operational problems (such as difficulties in obtaining equipment for repairs or finding qualified staff) and a limited pool of suitable buyers of Venezuelan crude, oil output will recover partly in the medium term, as producers adapt to post-sanctions export markets. Furthermore, relative macroeconomic stability-driven primarily by an expansion of dollarisation-will allow the non-oil economy to recover marginally in the medium term. Nonetheless, we assume that Venezuela's GDP (in real terms) will be only about half of its 2018 level, even in 2025.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation A severely reduced domestic goods supply, constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits will impede the disinflationary process in 2021-25. The regime has shown little inclination to take on the fiscal and macroeconomic reforms that would address the root causes of inflation. It has, however, lent its support to an ongoing process of de facto dollarisation, which will help to ease price pressures over time.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates Strong price pressures will sustain bolívar depreciation in 2021. Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency denomination (as in March 2018) or a new currency is a strong possibility. Although a number of currency regulations officially remain on the books, the regime has largely stopped enforcing them, in its recent embrace of dollar-isation. Although a black market for US dollars continues to operate, the premium is modest. On January 18th the black-market exchange rate stood at BsS1,663,064:US$1, just 7% above the official exchange rate of BsS1,548,933:US$1.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector Balance-of-payments pressures will remain severe throughout the forecast period, contributing to goods shortages and economic inequities. According to the BCV, foreign reserves stood at just US$6.3bn in November 2020-its lowest level in three decades. The steep decline in reserves, which has been several years in the making, reflects the impact of poor policymaking and a lack of economic diversification on the country's external sector.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect reserves to rise modestly over the forecast period, reaching US$8.6bn by end-2025. We expect that this result will be driven entirely by trends on the current account, since Venezuela's access to foreign capital will remain extremely limited. We expect the current-account deficit to narrow from an estimated 2.5% of GDP in 2020 to 0.5% of GDP in 2021. Thereafter, it will shift into a surplus, averaging 3% of GDP in 2022-25. Our forecast rests on the assumption that export earnings will pick up from a nadir in 2020, as international oil prices recover and the country steps up trade with new markets in Asia and the Middle East. We also expect that workers' remittances from abroad will play a crucial role in propping up the current-account balance, as Venezuelan emigrants (totalling over 6m since 2013) are gradually absorbed into the labour markets in their host countries.

Full text: - The right-wing government of the president, Jair Bolsonaro, has built a loose alliance with centrist parties in order to bolster governability in Brazil's highly fragmented Congress, as well as to advance his economic reform and socially conservative agenda. Tensions with the judiciary will simmer as the authorities investigate the affairs of the president's three sons.
- Economic policymaking will be guided by the need to return to fiscal sustainability after stimulus in 2020 on the back of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the fiscal deficit will widen to an estimated 16% of GDP in 2020, lifting the public debt/GDP ratio to nearly 100% by 2021. Assuming recovery and consolidation thereafter, we then expect this ratio to stabilise.
- The economy is recovering since activity hit its lowest point in April (at the height of lockdown restrictions). GDP will fall by an estimated 4.5% in 2020, before recovering partly in 2021, growing by 3.7%. GDP growth will average 2% annually in 2022-25. Despite policy accommodation, Brazil's productive capacity will be damaged by the crisis, impairing medium-term potential growth.
- Inflation will ease from 4.3% in November 2020 as a surge in food prices eases and the rate will fluctuate around the declining mid-point target (3.75% in 2021, 3.5% in 2022 and 3.25% in 2023) over the medium term.
- The Real will continue to strengthen from R5.1:US$1 currently to just below R4.8:US$1 by 2022, with a start to interest-rate normalisation around mid-2021 lifting interest-rate differentials. Import compression will offset weaker exports in 2020, but we estimate that lower profit remittances and a narrower net tourism deficit owing to travel restrictions will reduce the current-account deficit to less than 1% of GDP this year. Assuming a recovery, the deficit will widen to 3% by 2025.
- Following recession in 2020, a projected recovery will expand Brazil's large domestic market above US$2trn by 2025. Notwithstanding some simplifications, the tax system will remain burdensome and one of the weakest areas of the business environment. Infrastructure investment through a concessions prog-ramme will help to ease logistical bottlenecks, but upgrades and extensions will materialise only slowly.

- Fiscal consolidation needs after hefty stimulus during the coronavirus pandemic and the 2022 electoral cycle will complicate government efforts to improve the business environment and enact structural reforms. Brazil's large economy is attractive, but poor government effectiveness, a burdensome tax system, archaic infrastructure, deficiencies in factor markets and skills shortages will impair business.

Country forecast overview: Brazil's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic delays privatisations of several state-owned subsidiaries, but parent companies require legislative approval, blocking divestments. Partial privatisation of Eletrobras, the state-owned energy firm, is possible.
2023-25: Privatisations continue. Fiscal pressures encourage private capital in infrastructure projects. Investment Partner-ships Programme (PPI) advances further, with improved legal framework and regulatory agencies.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Pandemic hits foreign direct investment (FDI). Changes to "pre-salt" oil auction rules and PPI attracts FDI.
2023-25: Brazil's OECD accession boosts foreign investment. Ideological issues within current government put nationalist politics ahead of economic pragmatism in certain situations.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Despite anti-globalisation moves in advanced economies, some bilateral and regional trade negotiations progress. EU-Mercosul deal not expected to be ratified by EU parliaments.
2023-25: Steps taken to make Real a fully convertible currency.
Taxes 2021-22: Post-coronavirus consolidation needs may lead to higher taxes.
2023-25: Tax simplification unifies three federal, state and municipal taxes into one value-added tax (VAT).
Financing 2021-22: Financial system weathers pandemic; Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank) provides emergency credit. BCB gains independence, improving efficiency and competitiveness, reducing borrowing costs. Credit resumes after crisis.
2023-25: Renewed growth in domestic equity and bond issuance as state banks dial back subsidised credit lines.
The labour market 2021-22: Unemployment surges owing to pandemic. Government implements further measures to reduce cost of labour.
2023-25: Steps to boost long-term labour productivity complicated by continued weak education policies.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Infrastructure concessions advance (through PPI), but coronavirus, and political and institutional constraints may cause delays. Corruption and recession weigh on established construction companies, opening industry up for newcomers.
2023-25: Industry newcomers' lack of experience causes project delays.
Technological readiness 2021-22: Fifth-generation (5G) frequencies to be auctioned in 2021. Quality of communications rises as demand expands.
2023-25: Building of 5G infrastructure network commences and is rolled out to consumers.

a Actual.
Background: A new constitution was ratified in 1988 after more than 20 years of military rule. The government of Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995-2002) ended hyperinflation and advanced reforms to liberalise the economy. Under a former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-10), Brazil reaped the benefits of the reforms and enjoyed a consumer-led, commodities-fuelled boom. When this cycle ended, discontent owing to a weak economy, corruption and poor public services led to street protests. Lula's successor as president, Dilma Rousseff (2011-16), nonetheless won a second four-year term in 2014, but was impeached in 2016 over budget irregularities. Her vice-president, Michel Temer (2016-18), finished her term. Jair Bolsonaro won the October 2018 election and took office as president in January 2019.
Political structure: The president executes policy approved by the 513-seat Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and the 81-seat Senate (the upper house). Constitutional review is conducted by an independent judiciary. Although the president can resort to temporary decrees to push through legislation, the constitution gives Congress ample scope to check the executive. In the lower house, 30 political parties are represented and party discipline has traditionally been weak.
Policy issues: The benefits and entitlements established under the 1988 constitution have contributed to a doubling in central government primary spending, to over 27% of GDP. Congress passed a federal spending cap in 2016 and a robust pension reform in October 2019. The Banco Central do Brasil (the central bank) cut the Selic policy rate to 2% in August, a record low. The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic is leading to expansionary fiscal, monetary and credit policies to offset the hit to the economy and financial system, lifting public debt/GDP above 95%.
Taxation: Brazil has a poorly structured revenue system, characterised by a heavy tax burden, a narrow tax base, complicated levies and widespread evasion. Both foreign and domestic companies employ tax professionals and devote considerable resources to managing their tax affairs. The corporate and indirect tax systems are particularly complex, porous and unwieldy; the income tax system is considered to be relatively efficient, with a top rate of 27.5%.
Foreign trade: The coronavirus-induced recession and a weaker currency are narrowing the current-account deficit, which is an estimated 0.8% of GDP in 2020. Agricultural exports support a moderate, structural trade surplus.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability The political environment in 2021 will be shaped by the deployment of coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccines and by the efforts of the right-wing, populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, to maintain his new-found popularity among poorer Brazilians (stemming from emergency assistance payments) and consolidate his alliances with the centrão, a group of centrist parties that performed well in the November 2020 municipal elections and that hold the key to control of Congress. Their support-in exchange for political favours, including govern-ment posts and budget allocations-will help the president to advance his socially conservative agenda and ward off potential impeachment risks. These have subsided recently, after emerging in early 2020 owing to the president's confrontational rhetoric against Congress and the Supreme Court, but could re-emerge in the run-up to the October 2022 election. Although his new alliances will bolster his position, the president's loose governing coalition will face challenges from more progressive centre-right parties, who will want to secure the leadership of the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) in the February leadership election in order to control the agenda, and because they will potentially back their own presidential candidate. Meanwhile, Mr Bolsonaro's alliance with the centrão reduces the impetus for market reforms espoused by his free-market economy minister, Paulo Guedes, and could weaken fiscal discipline.
Despite having the world's second-highest Covid-19 death toll (184,000 and rising as at mid-December 2020), the president's ploy of downplaying the pandemic has not resulted in a loss of personal popularity, mostly owing to the income transfers that have attracted support from a new-found low-income base, compensating for lost support from anti-corruption-driven voters that now consider it largely empty. According to a local pollster, Datafolha, the president's approval is still significantly higher than it was at the beginning of the year, and stood at 37% in December 2020 (up from 32% in December 2019). The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Mr Bolsonaro to try to retain the support of his core conservative voters and of lower-income voters (particularly in the populous north-east), to boost his re-election chances. However, his popularity is likely to take a hit when cash transfers end from January 2021.
Mr Bolsonaro's proximity to the military (he is a retired captain) has fuelled tension, especially with the judiciary. Although we expect calm relations for the time being, tensions could resurface, given the president's impetuous nature and investigations swirling around him (relating to alleged political interference in the federal police earlier this year) and around his sons, Carlos (a local councillor, involved in "fake news" campaigns against political opponents) and Flávio (a senator, implicated in a local assembly graft scheme). Not only has the president put retired military officers in important cabinet positions-including Hamilton Mourão as vice-president-and stacked lower-ranking officials in the state bureaucracy, but in early 2020 he also actively supported bolsonaristas who attacked opponents in Congress (as well as in the judiciary and media), and called for military intervention. However, a rupture of constitutional rule is unlikely, as voters would protest; polls suggest that 75% of Brazilians support democracy as the best form of government. Meanwhile, most high-ranking military officials are reluctant to associate too closely with Mr Bolsonaro.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch The November local elections boosted traditional centrist parties, suggesting that, regardless of their opinions of Mr Bolsonaro, voters are unlikely to elect a left-leaning president in October 2022. The field for the presidential race will again be large, but it looks likely to be a close re-run of the 2018 vote, with Mr Bolsonaro probably backed by the centrão-competing against whomever a former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-10), nominates as the Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT) candidate. This assumes that Lula, who was convicted of corruption, does not unexpectedly become eligible to stand. The PT performed poorly in the local elections and leftist parties are unlikely to unite behind a single candidate, which could reduce the chances of the PT candidate (or other emerging leftist rivals) contesting a probable second-round run-off. The surprise factor could come from a centre-right candidate, such as João Doria, the governor of São Paulo state, but this third-way could suffer a similar fate as the left if it fails to unite. Notwithstanding the advantages of incumbency, a strong centre-right could present a tougher contest for Mr Bolsonaro in a run-off, as the president would not be able to capitalise on anti-PT sentiment as he did in 2018. It is too early to make a call; Mr Bolsonaro's standing could be affected by unexpected developments in Brazil's tumultuous political environment. If the president cannot boost social spending to the poor before the election, his popularity and chances of re-election could weaken.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations The president's anti-globalist rhetoric and facilitation of illegal deforestation in the Amazon rainforest is tarnishing Brazil's international standing. However, as one of the world's ten largest economies and a major commodity exporter, Brazil will remain a significant global player. Under the presidency of Joe Biden in the US, bilateral relations will be cooler while Mr Bolsonaro is president given their divergent stances, particularly regarding climate change and deforest-ation. The relationship has made a bumpy start, as Mr Bolsonaro was the last major world leader to congratulate Mr Biden, but we assume that a pragmatic approach will prevail, with common ground on anti-China sentiment.
Brazil will remain as one of the battlegrounds in US-China rivalry; a fifth-generation (5G) licence auction scheduled for 2021 will prove tricky for the government given the local presence of Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications company. Anti-Chinese rhetoric by nationalist government figures is causing bilateral tensions, but military figures will encourage the president to be pragmatic regarding China's acquisition of assets, as Brazil needs investments in major infrastructure and energy projects. We do not expect a free-trade agreement (FTA) between the EU and Mercosul (the Southern Cone customs union comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) to be ratified soon, owing to EU concerns over Mr Bolsonaro's environmental policies. Now that there is also pressure from Mr Biden on environmental issues, Brazil's efforts to join the OECD face delays.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends Policymaking in 2021 will focus on the Covid-19 vaccine rollout and the government's structural reform agenda, which was overshadowed by the pandemic. However, some initiatives will be limited by a need to return to fiscal sustainability and the dialling down of emergency stimulus. Overall, we expect the government to make only piecemeal progress on its agenda, as Mr Bolsonaro's commitment to reforms and to fiscal consolidation appears to be waning; he is prioritising his alliance with centrão parties (which resist Mr Guedes's more ambitious, free-market reforms) and his 2022 re-election bid.
The government will focus primarily on passing revenue-neutral tax simp-lification reforms to unify three or more consumption taxes into a single value-added tax (VAT); Mr Guedes has almost given up his efforts to levy a new 0.2% digital payments tax to finance a reduction in payroll costs amid widespread congressional resistance. The government will attempt to make progress on other structural reforms proposed by Mr Guedes-including streamlining the public sector, bringing greater order and flexibility to budget management and privatisations. The government presented a watered-down version of its administrative reform (which includes the elimination of job security for most future public servants) to Congress in September in the latest signal that the economy minister's agenda will be diluted. Although the electoral complication of the municipal polls has now been overcome, there is a very small window of opportunity (until mid-2021) to press on with any reforms before attention turns to the 2022 elections. However, we expect a broadly revenue-neutral tax simplification reform, possibly including changes to tax rates.
Overshadowing policymaking will be the need to consolidate the public finances, given the high and rising public debt/GDP ratio (91% in October 2020) and increasing fears in financial markets that the government will breach its constitutionally mandated public spending cap. Policymakers have deployed huge fiscal stimulus in 2020 (about 8% of GDP directly, and even more including below-the-line items and government guarantees) to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, including monthly cash transfers of R600 (US$115) to more than 60m informal workers until September (dialled down to R300 until end-2020). Although Mr Bolsonaro signalled that extending the transfers into 2021 was on the table (as they had buoyed his popularity), he has officially announced that the programme will end in 2020 as planned. Instead, the government will study expanding the existing Bolsa Família welfare pro-gramme, which is much smaller in scale as it benefits around 20m people, compared with the more than 65m people reached by emergency relief. Negotiations on the expansion will begin after the February congressional elections. In this context, risks that the spending cap will be breached have subsided for now, but (although this is not currently our baseline forecast) there is a chance that debt-sustainability concerns could return if the expansion plans are not aligned with the fiscal rules, especially as the 2022 elections near.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy After surging to an estimated 95% in 2020 owing to pandemic-related support measures, currency depreciation and recession, the public debt/GDP ratio will grow to 96% in 2021 as fiscal revenue only partly recovers. Stopping a more substantial rise will require consolidation; otherwise, concerns about debt sustainability will re-emerge among investors, raising the country risk premium. The government will avoid raising taxes ahead of the 2022 election, but tax increases thereafter cannot be ruled out. The "state of calamity" approved by Congress amid the pandemic allowed the government to sidestep constit-utionally mandated fiscal rules in 2020 and increase spending, but an extension of this in 2021 (a growing possibility, albeit not currently our baseline forecast) would unnerve investors. The fiscal hit from the crisis is apparent in the widening of the 12-month rolling overall deficit, to 13.95% of GDP in October 2020. We expect measures to be mostly removed in 2021; the deficit will narrow to 7.2% of GDP as revenue increases. Consolidation of these trends will narrow the deficit to less than 5% of GDP on average in 2022-25. We anticipate that public debt will stabilise within the forecast period, helped by privatisation proceeds and currency revaluation, but there is a growing risk that debt will exceed 100% if the president yields to an election-related increase in spending.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy Policy accommodation during the 2020 crisis will give way to a normalisation process beginning in mid-2021. The Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank) cut the Selic policy rate to 2% (a record low) in August 2020. With rates considered close to the lower bound for Brazil, further easing is unlikely. We expect the BCB to gain formal independence in early 2021 as the legislative agenda gets back on track after the congressional leadership elections. As the economy recovers during 2021-25, we expect policy normalisation, beginning after mid-2021, to take the Selic to 5.5% by 2023 (a real interest rate of 2-3%, which we consider to be neutral, up from over -2% currently). The mid-point inflation target will fall by 25 basis points each year in 2020-23, from 4% to 3.25% (the 2024 target will be set in 2021 and could fall further). The most significant risk to the environment of low interest rates and inflation is an unexpected abandonment of the 2016 spending cap rules, as it could trigger a market sell-out that may force the BCB to tighten policy sooner and by more than expected.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth Following an estimated 4.5% contraction in 2020, real GDP will recover partly in 2021, expanding by 3.7%, assuming that major corona-virus lockdowns are avoided. However, growth in 2021 will be mostly due to strong statistical effects from the 2020 rebound, and sequential growth will be quite weak owing to the withdrawal of most fiscal stimulus. Although low interest rates and inflation will be supportive factors (along with a recovering global economy), lasting damage to the productive sector and jobs, and to corporate and household balance sheets, means that we do not expect output to return to pre-corona-virus levels until 2022. Leading indicators show that the rebound in the third quarter of 2020 (7.7% quarter on quarter) is slowing in the fourth quarter (to an estimated 2.4%) as income transfers are dialled down. Our forecasts assume the approval of tax simplification reforms and progress on other microeconomic reform agenda items, but we recognise that governability risks could hamper advances.
On the demand side, the upturn in 2021-25 will be driven by stronger investment (buoyed by lower interest rates, privatisations and infrastructure concessions) and by private consumption, supported by lower interest rates and credit growth. The withdrawal of emergency cash transfers in 2021 will initially be offset by the use of household savings (which rose in 2020) until the jobs market strengthens later in the year. On the supply side, commodity exports will accelerate in 2021-25, in line with a recovery in global demand. Manu-facturing has already rebounded owing to stimulus for consumers and a weaker currency, which could continue to make goods more competitive against imports in 2021-25. Positive vaccine news should provide a boost to consumer and business confidence, but the recovery of services sectors will not fully materialise until successful deployment of a vaccine beyond vulnerable groups from mid-2021 removes the need for social distancing measures.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation A stronger policy framework than in the past will help to anchor inflation expectations, and minimum-wage increases are unlikely to be much above inflation (if at all). There is a risk that inflation expectations will become unanchored if pandemic-induced fiscal expansion is unexpectedly not brought under control. We consider that the recent uptick in inflation (4.3% in November 2020)-related to higher food and commodity prices, as well as a weaker currency and higher demand created by emergency cash transfers-will be transitory. Assuming a gradual economic recovery in 2021-25, and barring periodic weather-related food shortages, an unexpected surge in oil prices or fiscal slippage, inflation should fluctuate close to the (lower) mid-point targets for 2021 (3.75%), 2022 (3.5%) and 2023 (3.25%). The 2024 target will be set in mid-2021 and could fall to 3%.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates Swings in global conditions and jitters over fiscal risks will keep the Real volatile, but it should continue to regain some of its losses over the medium term; the Real has already made gains in late 2020 as coronavirus-induced risk aversion has eased, and it will end at R5.1:US$1-about 22% weaker than at end-2019. We expect the Real to strengthen towards R4.6:US$1 by 2025, fluctuating in line with Brazil's terms of trade, interest-rate differentials and global risk sentiment. A deeper local capital market for long-term debt will discourage corporate external borrowing, reducing capital inflows. The main forecast risk owes to the possibility of a market sell-off if confidence in debt sustainability evaporates.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector Risks to Brazil's external position will be assuaged by its modest current-account deficit and external debt ratios, comfortable reserves cushion and a Real no longer overvalued by high interest rates (as in the past). Public external debt is low and most companies have some sort of currency hedge, despite moderate private external debt. The trade balance will post a large structural surplus during 2021-25, owing to stable commodity exports to China, but this will narrow gradually as imports rise following recession-related compression in 2020.
After narrowing in 2020, the current-account deficit will widen gradually during 2021-25 as imports recover in line with the economy, and will exceed 3.5% of GDP by 2025. After dropping to an estimated 3.6% of GDP in 2020, inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) will average 4% of GDP in 2021-25, reflecting sizeable market opportunities.

Full text: - The tenure of the president, Muhammadu Buhari, will last until 2023 and be blemished by a decline in living standards caused by recession in 2020, a rise in unemployment and (paradoxically) high, policy-induced inflation.
- The administration will struggle to tackle high levels of poverty and the country's ethnic and religious divisions, leading to chronic insecurity in some regions and the risk of protests in normally stable cities. Pro-market reforms are needed to vitalise the economy, but the political backdrop will obstruct their full implementation.
- A decline in living standards under Mr Buhari, whose tenure has been marked by two recessions, as well as frustrations over pervasive insecurity and poor governance means that the opposition People's Democratic Party is forecast to win the 2023 election.
- Low world oil prices will continue to exert pressure on the multiple-exchange-rate regime and, in 2021, force another devaluation of the official rate. Foreign-exchange supply is then expected to improve, allowing the market to stabilise in 2022-25 and become more liquid. The Central Bank of Nigeria is not expected to relinquish heavy-handed control of the currency.
- Low oil prices in 2021 will coincide with large recurrent government spending commitments and result in another substantial fiscal deficit, by Nigerian standards. The budget shortfall will then broadly edge down as external conditions improve, the domestic economy picks up and revenue rises. Debt-servicing will become more manageable than in 2020, when there was a conflict between staying current on obligations and providing a response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.
- Given a crippling infrastructure deficit, untethered inflation, instability in crucial agricultural regions and high unemployment, we expect growth of just 1.2% in 2021. Only when the exchange rate and inflation stabilise will there be a more meaningful recovery.
- Inflation will stay high in 2021 as devaluation of the naira, price deregulation, instability in agricultural growing areas, monetary loosening and exchange-rate restrictions for staple imports feed into consumer prices. Monetary tightening is expected to start from 2022 to tackle the issue.
- We expect a current-account deficit for a third consecutive year in 2021 (something that has not been seen since the 1990s) despite a modest increase in oil prices. The current account will return to surplus in 2022-25 as the oil market recovers and petrol import volumes decline.

- Nigeria's business environment score worsens slightly for the forecast period (2021-25) as the macroeconomic and security environment remains highly challenging. As a result, its global and regional rankings fall.

Country forecast overview: Nigeria's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: The overarching policy objective is to promote self-sufficiency and local industrialisation through protectionism. As a result, the non-oil sector is be largely shielded from external competition.
2023-25: A new government (which is likely to be opposition-led) is likely to remain wary of opening up the economy.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: A reduction is made to royalties for offshore oil activity introduced in 2020 in an attempt to prevent divestment from oil majors operating in Nigeria. Outside the oil sector, concerns over the foreign-exchange regime deter investment.
2023-25: Energy firms remain hesitant about increasing their presence in a difficult operating environment, especially onshore, but concerted efforts are made to clean up the national oil company (which is in joint venture with oil majors).
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Movement of goods is highly regulated to prevent smuggling, but people will be allowed to cross land borders once the coronavirus pandemic is brought under control.
2023-25: A spread between the official and the parallel-market exchange rates persists as oil prices rise and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is again able to defend an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxes 2021-22: The focus on boosting tax compliance intensifies, but the weak state of the economy and upcoming elections prevent tax increases.
2023-25: Value-added tax (VAT) is raised from 7.5% to cut the budget deficit amid persistently high debt-servicing costs.
Financing 2021-22: The government returns to the sovereign debt market, and capital projects are restarted.
2023-25: Credit conditions become tighter as the CBN moves to control high inflation.
The labour market 2021-22: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers, restrictive visa regulations and poor health indicators.
2023-25: Employers continue to struggle to find qualified staff; unemployment stays high and the labour market loose.
Infrastructure 2021-22: A reduction in consumer subsidies (for petrol) frees up resources for higher public capital investment, but government spending remains small relative to the size of the economy, at under 7%.
2023-25: A large private refinery starts up, reducing Nigeria's near-total dependency on imported petrol.
Technological readiness 2021-22: Nigeria retains a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2023-25: Research spending remains low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960, and multi-party democracy was restored in 1999 after a protracted period of military rule. The first two presidential elections (in 1999 and 2003) were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. In 2015 Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari, who secured a second term in early 2019.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties predominate. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the predominant political force, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015 and secure re-election in 2019.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. The government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is a contentious issue, with important subsidy programmes hinging on an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take small as a share of GDP. With oil prices far lower than they were in 2010-14, it is likely that amendments to consumer taxes will be made, specifically in value-added tax (VAT, currently 7.5%).
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability The president, Muhammadu Buhari, will stay in power until his second (and final) term expires in 2023. He will be under immense pressure to stabilise Nigeria, but myriad security threats will prove unmanageable. The military and police are overstretched and unable to tackle simultaneous security crises. Emergencies will be triaged, with military resources deployed to whichever is considered the most pressing.
This shaky system will keep the government in power but leave the country highly dysfunctional and, in many regions, extremely insecure. Protests against police brutality in October 2020 morphed into an expression of wider political and economic malaise. Mr Buhari was able to appease the central demand of the campaign by disbanding a controversial police unit and promising security reform. Conciliation would be harder to repeat should a fresh, co-ordinated movement harness other grievances the protests tapped into, including unemployment, poor governance and a general decline in living standards. High inflation, partly resulting from petrol and electricity price deregulation, stands to be a particular driver of renewed unrest in 2021. Should protests grow in size, they would probably push Mr Buhari's administration to make compromises. The president's commitment to pro-market reforms is already judged to have wilted following recent protests, and, as evidence of policy drift, electricity and petrol price increases have been already softened.
Besides dealing with economic crisis, the government will remain embroiled in a conflict with Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), Islamist terrorist groups that are causing havoc in north-eastern Nigeria. As the region is a stronghold of the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), the president will be committed to asserting control, irrespective of how difficult this will be. Boko Haram and ISWAP will be aggressively countered, but the north-east-particularly Borno state-will remain a low-level conflict zone, and the campaign there will divert security forces away from other insecure parts of Nigeria.
One hotspot that is likely to remain insecure and neglected is the agricultural Middle Belt, where violent conflict between farmers and herdsmen over increasingly scarce land and water resources has killed thousands in recent years. Formal land-titling is often touted as a solution to the crisis; however, as it would in effect alienate one group from communal holdings in favour of another, it would prove too contentious. As with the north-east, the direct effects of the conflict will be localised, but the entire country will feel the fallout in the form of reduced local food production and high prices.
The military and police will be poorly equipped to suppress pervasive banditry and kidnapping, particularly in the north-west. A recent mass school kidnapping highlighted the sophistication and danger posed by armed groups; Boko Haram claimed that it was responsible for the incident. This appears to be the case, and it would be further evidence of terrorist groups operating more openly in the north-west, which could, over the course of the forecast period, begin to resemble the highly insecure north-east. More generally, widespread poverty and unemployment are feeding a cycle of crime that will be difficult (if not impossible) to break, given a bleak economic outlook for 2021 at least.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch The next national elections are due in 2023. In the most recent presidential election, in 2019, the candidates of both main parties were from the north, and custom dictates that the candidates in 2023 will be from the south. This should lead to an improvement on the abysmally low turnout in 2019 in the south, which is a stronghold of the main opposition party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP). Frustration with high prices, declining living standards and perpetual instability will be directed at the APC, giving the PDP a winning edge.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations Nigeria will remain a major player in Sub-Saharan Africa given its size, but its domestic challenges tend to keep policymakers inwardly focused. Exasperation over smuggling, which policymakers view as undermining local industry, led the government to close all of Nigeria's land borders to goods traffic in late 2019 and only open them in late-December of 2020. Given rising local prices in Nigeria for agricultural goods (and so declining international competitiveness), there will be no rush to open the economy up to food imports, although the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, to which Nigeria is a signatory, will require this over time. Protectionism (underpinned by foreign-exchange restrictions) also makes Nigeria's adoption of a common West African currency, the eco, highly unlikely.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends As part of its response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the government has sought about US$6.9bn (about 2% of GDP) from multilateral lenders. Not all the loans are low-conditionality, encouraging Mr Buhari to enact the boldest economic reforms of his tenure. A cap on pump prices has ostensibly been removed since September 2020, causing petrol prices to reach record levels (for Nigeria). Ending petrol price caps is essential for freeing up fiscal space, and new refineries that are either being built or at the planning stage (including a 650,000-barrel/day facility under construction) will require pricing to be suitable for supply to the domestic market. Electricity tariffs have also been raised. Moving towards cost-reflexivity is crucial to alleviate a burden of bad debts that run along the power supply chain, which has made the sector dysfunctional and resulted in regular outages.
However, political pressures mean the government may well fail to keep prices liberal on a permanent basis. Recent protests in southern Nigeria are partially a product of price reforms, fitting into a wider exasperation over declining living standards, and political pressure has already prompted a scaling down of electricity price increases. Reinstatement of outright petrol price controls is made less likely by a new Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), which has a good chance of passing through parliament. The legislation is likely to streamline sector-wide regulation in the process of creating a new, profit-oriented national oil company (which by definition could not be weighed down by subsidising the retail market). The downstream industry should become commercially viable from this reorganisation of the sector, allowing Nigeria to wean itself off petrol imports as new refinery capacity comes on stream (which we expect to happen by 2022). The PIB will also encourage upstream oil investment by making fiscal terms clearer for multinationals. However, upward shifts in crude oil costs are unlikely to be followed by a unitary price increase at the pump until the PIB comes into force, and electricity tariffs are likely to remain heavily regulated. Accordingly, we do not expect the sustained electricity price increases needed for the power sector to become financially sound, implying that electricity undersupply will continue to hinder industrialisation.
Another policy-area which will be shrouded in considerable uncertainty is management of the naira. Low foreign-exchange inflows-reflecting low global oil prices-has provided scope for unifying the overvalued official exchange rate (used for government transactions) and the more market-determined Nigerian autonomous foreign-exchange fixing (NAFEX) rate. However, there remains a spread between these and the parallel exchange rate, underlining market distortions. Rather than let the naira weaken on a sustained basis or clear a large foreign exchange order backlog by depleting reserves, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has widened an array of currency restrictions and let market turnover contract (widening the spread between the NAFEX and parallel rates) to modulate the pace of outflows. Such policies will sustain considerable foreign-exchange illiquidity into 2021 as oil prices stay low.
When foreign-exchange availability improves and the current account returns to surplus, which we expect in 2022, the official rate is likely to again be quoted at a discount to the NAFEX. The idea of a single market rate has been proposed before (most recently in 2016) only to be jettisoned once foreign reserves increased, and the government only plans to manage the exchange-rate regime "sustainably" in the long run. An overvalued official exchange rate allows sectors deemed economically important, namely agriculture and manufacturing, to be subsidised, and fits an agenda of job creation and self-sufficiency through protectionism. A ban on accessing foreign exchange to purchase various imports (currently covering 45 items) is another arm of this strategy. From an investor perspective, the managed nature of the exchange-rate regime poses a risk of capital controls, especially when oil prices are low, as they will be in 2021. We expect the long-term impact of the currency regime on investor confidence to prevent foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows from exceeding 1% of GDP throughout the forecast period.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy We expect the fiscal balance to stay in deficit in 2021-25. Crude oil receipts comprise more than 50% of the federal government's retained income, indicating a continued revenue crunch as oil prices stay low in 2021. High debt-servicing costs, pressing security needs and a large public wage bill will elevate expenditure throughout the forecast period. Widespread tax avoidance and low oil prices compared with the 2010-14 super-cycle will keep federally retained revenue below 4% of GDP throughout 2021-25.
Capital expenditure for the purposes of stimulus will be emphasised in 2021 now that subsidies (which are taken from revenue) have been reduced. This increase in fixed investment will be relatively small, but given low oil prices and so fiscal receipts, we expect a deficit equivalent to 3% of GDP. Higher oil prices will stabilise the deficit in 2022, despite a pre-election increase in spending, particularly on security. With a probable rise in value-added tax (VAT) rates (to curb a hazardously high debt-revenue ratio) after the 2023 elections, and oil prices continuing to rise, the deficit will shrink to an average of 2.7% of GDP in 2023-24, before widening to 3% of GDP in 2025 as oil prices fall.
As interest rates are currently low for the sovereign, domestic debt will be more attractive in the near-to-medium term. Some multilateral loans will also be secured, but we expect the government to return to the international capital market from 2021 in order to supplement this.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy The CBN will fail to prevent inflation from exceeding its target ceiling of 9% over much of the forecast period, and its policy decisions are likely to be erratic. In the context of a probable recession and limited fiscal firepower, it decided to cut the policy rate by 100 basis points to 11.5% in September (after a 100-basis-point cut in May), despite an upward trend in annual inflation, to 13.2% in August. The strategy is to boost the supply side of the real economy to bring inflation back under control. In our view this is misguided; high and rising inflation will frustrate an economic recovery, and issues such as inadequate public infrastructure, hard-currency shortages and rampant instability need to be addressed before the supply side can moderate the price level. Our expectation is for high inflation to persist, compelling the CBN to raise interest rates once the current economic crisis passes. We expect this to happen in 2022, with easing resuming only in 2024 when inflation has fallen appreciably.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth The economy is expected to exit recession in 2021 as the impact of lockdown in 2020 fades, but high inflation will impede improvements in business sentiment and dampen real purchasing power amid low productivity, underemployment and low nominal wage growth. Fiscal stimulus will be an inadequate counterforce, given budget constraints, and loosened monetary policy (despite high inflation) will contribute to ongoing exchange-rate scarcity and further undermine macroeconomic stability. Oil production will, however, rise slightly as quotas agreed by OPEC+ (comprising OPEC and a group of non-OPEC countries) are relaxed, and given an uptick in oil exports we expect growth of 1.1% in 2021.
The CBN is expected to tighten monetary policy from 2022, which will circumscribe the nascent economic recovery, but the exchange rate will stabilise and inflation should ease. As non-business financial penetration is low, private consumption will recover alongside disinflation even as interest rates rise. OPEC+ quotas will be raised from April that year and new refining capacity is expected to come on stream in earnest, boosting real exports (with some output for the regional market) and reducing imports. Consequently, we expect growth of 3% in 2022. As refinery output continues to ramp up, crude oil exports rise, inflation falls and real spending power recovers, growth will pick up to an annual average of 3.7% in 2023-24. However, these rates of growth are well below potential. The economy will continue to lack dynamism owing to high interest rates, low FDI, high unemployment, pervasive instability in agricultural regions and infrastructure deficiencies, particularly regarding stable power supply. A more challenging year is forecast for 2025 as oil prices fall sharply and macroeconomic uncertainty rises, with growth slipping back to 1.7%.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation Looser monetary policy (which will lead to currency adjustments), combined with higher fuel and electricity tariffs, foreign-exchange restrictions on various imported goods-including staple foods-and devaluation of the naira will raise inflation to an average of 16% in 2021, with increases on both the core and non-core level. Assuming that rising oil prices stabilise the exchange rate, and the CBN eventually tightens monetary policy, we expect the annual inflation rate to fall throughout 2022-25, to 8.5% at end-2025. Conflict and agricultural supply disruptions in the Middle Belt-Nigeria's breadbasket-as well as foreign-exchange controls on imported goods will prevent a faster fall.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates The CBN is supplying foreign exchange to regulated trading windows but only fitfully, and a large unmet order book for foreign exchange from exporters. Assuming that oil prices stay low in 2021 and with low domestic interest rates sustaining capital outflow pressures, activated as and when the CBN drip feeds foreign exchange to official windows, we expect a devaluation of the official rate in that year (following two adjustments in 2020). This will take the naira from N379:US$1 at end-2020 to N450:US$1 at end-2021. The official and NAFEX rates will be broadly unified in the process. For the remainder of the forecast period the official exchange rate to the US dollar is expected to be kept relatively stable. Monetary tightening in Nigeria will again encourage hot money inflows, higher oil prices will boost foreign exchange access (lessening concerns over capital controls), and the current account is forecast to return to surplus. Divergence between official and NAFEX rates is likely to re-emerge, but the CBN should be able to supply adequate liquidity to regulated foreign-exchange channels, broadly stabilising the market even as world oil prices (and so net foreign-exchange flows) fluctuate.
Forecasting the naira Although The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts both the official and the secondary market rates, it is the official rate that appears in most of its data presentations, as this is the longest-running and best-tracked variable. The official rate also best represents exchange-rate policy. Indicators that are converted into US dollars at the official rate are essentially overvalued, which is in line with official calculations.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector An export slump due to low world oil prices and OPEC+ production quotas will keep the current account in deficit in 2021, for a third consecutive year (a stretch unseen since the early 1990s), with a shortfall of 1.8% of GDP expected. This is despite a slight uptick in imports of goods and services as the economy recovers and coronavirus-related travel restrictions imposed in 2020 are lifted, with a devalued naira restraining the increase. Over the remainder of the forecast period a current-account surplus is expected. Oil prices are projected to rise in 2022-23, which will expand exports, while lower petroleum import volumes as new domestic refinery capacity comes on stream will constrain growth in the import bill (otherwise driven by real naira appreciation). Remittances from the large Nigerian diaspora should also increase as the coronavirus crisis passes globally. This will all contribute to an annual average current-account surplus of 0.9% of GDP in 2022-24. The surplus will then ebb to 0.7% of GDP in 2025 as falling oil prices push down export earnings and continued real effective exchange-rate appreciation and monetary easing cause imports to continue to rise. The deficit in 2021 will be financed largely by debt inflows, with investment inflows being limited by a dysfunctional foreign-exchange market in that year.

Full text: - The tenure of the president, Muhammadu Buhari, will last until 2023 and be blemished by a decline in living standards caused by recession in 2020, a rise in unemployment and (paradoxically) high, policy-induced inflation.
- The administration will struggle to tackle high levels of poverty and the country's ethnic and religious divisions. This potent mixture has the potential to cause protests that halt the advancement of pro-market reforms.
- A decline in living standards under Mr Buhari, whose tenure has been marked by two recessions, as well as frustrations over pervasive insecurity and poor governance means that the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) is forecast to win the 2023 election.
- The Economist Intelligence Unit expects some reregulation of electricity pricing under a PDP government. Although this would be bad news for the power sector, we do not expect a return to distortive pricing in the petroleum sector.
- Low world oil prices will continue to exert pressure on the multiple-exchange-rate regime and, in 2021, force another devaluation of the official rate. Foreign-exchange supply is then expected to improve, allowing the market to stabilise in 2022-25.
- Low oil prices in 2021 will coincide with large recurrent government spending commitments and result in another substantial fiscal deficit, by Nigerian standards. The budget shortfall will then broadly edge down as external conditions improve, the domestic economy picks up and revenue rises.
- Given a crippling infrastructure deficit, high inflation, instability in crucial agricultural regions and high unemployment, we expect growth of just 1.2% in 2021. Only when the exchange rate and inflation stabilise will there be a more meaningful recovery.
- Inflation will stay high in 2021 as devaluation of the naira, price deregulation, instability in agricultural growing areas, monetary loosening and exchange-rate restrictions for staple imports feed into consumer prices. Monetary tightening is expected to start from 2022 to tackle the issue.
- We expect a current-account deficit for a third consecutive year in 2021 (something that has not been seen since the 1990s) despite a modest increase in oil prices. The current account will return to surplus in 2022-25 as the oil market recovers and petrol import volumes decline.

- Nigeria's business environment score worsens slightly for the forecast period (2021-25) as the macroeconomic and security environment remains highly challenging. As a result, its global and regional rankings fall.

Country forecast overview: Nigeria's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: The overarching policy objective is to promote self-sufficiency and local industrialisation through protectionism. As a result, the non-oil sector is be largely shielded from external competition.
2023-25: A new government (which is likely to be opposition-led) is likely to remain wary of opening up the economy.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: A reduction is made to royalties for offshore oil activity introduced in 2020 in an attempt to prevent divestment from oil majors operating in Nigeria. Outside the oil sector, concerns over the foreign-exchange regime deter investment.
2023-25: Energy firms remain hesitant about increasing their presence in a difficult operating environment, especially onshore, but concerted efforts are made to clean up the national oil company (which is in joint venture with oil majors).
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Movement of goods is highly regulated to prevent smuggling, but people will be allowed to cross land borders once the coronavirus pandemic is brought under control.
2023-25: A spread between the official and the parallel-market exchange rates persists as oil prices rise and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is again able to defend an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxes 2021-22: The focus on boosting tax compliance intensifies, but the weak state of the economy and upcoming elections prevent tax increases.
2023-25: Value-added tax (VAT) is raised from 7.5% to cut the budget deficit amid persistently high debt-servicing costs.
Financing 2021-22: The government returns to the sovereign debt market, and capital projects are restarted.
2023-25: Credit conditions become tighter as the CBN moves to control high inflation.
The labour market 2021-22: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers, restrictive visa regulations and poor health indicators.
2023-25: Employers continue to struggle to find qualified staff; unemployment stays high and the labour market loose.
Infrastructure 2021-22: A reduction in consumer subsidies (for petrol) frees up resources for higher public capital investment, but government spending remains small relative to the size of the economy, at under 7%.
2023-25: A large private refinery starts up, reducing Nigeria's near-total dependency on imported petrol.
Technological readiness 2021-22: Nigeria retains a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2023-25: Research spending remains low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960, and multi-party democracy was restored in 1999 after a protracted period of military rule. The first two presidential elections (in 1999 and 2003) were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. In 2015 Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari, who secured a second term in early 2019.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties predominate. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the predominant political force, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015 and secure re-election in 2019.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. The government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is a contentious issue, with important subsidy programmes hinging on an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take small as a share of GDP. With oil prices far lower than they were in 2010-14, it is likely that amendments to consumer taxes will be made, specifically in value-added tax (VAT, currently 7.5%).
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability The president, Muhammadu Buhari, will stay in power until his second (and final) term expires in 2023. He will be under immense pressure to stabilise Nigeria, but myriad security threats will prove unmanageable. The military and police are overstretched and unable to tackle simultaneous security crises. Emergencies will be triaged, with military resources deployed to whichever is considered the most pressing.
This shaky system will keep the government in power but leave the country highly dysfunctional and, in many regions, extremely insecure. Protests against police brutality in October 2020 morphed into an expression of wider political and economic malaise, which proved capable of galvanising mass action. Mr Buhari was able to appease the central demand of the campaign by disbanding a controversial police unit and promising security reform. Conciliation would be harder to repeat should a fresh, co-ordinated movement harness the other grievances that the protests tapped into, including unemployment, poor governance and a general decline in living standards. This will be an omnipresent, potentially existential threat for his administration. High inflation, partly resulting from petrol and electricity price deregulation, stands to be a particular driver of renewed unrest in 2021, with a strong risk of organised mass protests in normally stable cities such as the commercial capital, Lagos, and the administrative capital, Abuja. Government buildings but also private enterprise could be targeted by a violent minority, as was the case in recent unrest. Should protests grow in size, they would probably push Mr Buhari's administration to make compromises. The president's commitment to pro-market reforms is already judged to have wilted following recent protests, and, as evidence of policy drift, a planned electricity tariff increase has been already softened.
Besides dealing with economic crisis, the government will remain embroiled in a conflict with Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), Islamist terrorist groups that are causing havoc in north-eastern Nigeria. As the region is a stronghold of the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), the president will be committed to asserting control, irrespective of how difficult this will be. Boko Haram and ISWAP will be aggressively countered, but the north-east-particularly Borno state-will remain a low-level conflict zone, and the campaign there will divert security forces away from other insecure parts of Nigeria.
One hotspot that is likely to remain insecure and neglected is the agricultural Middle Belt, where violent conflict between farmers and herdsmen over increasingly scarce land and water resources has killed thousands in recent years. Formal land-titling is often touted as a solution to the crisis; however, as it would in effect alienate one group from communal holdings in favour of another, it would prove too contentious. As with the north-east, the direct effects of the conflict will be localised, but the entire country will feel the fallout in the form of reduced local food production and high prices.
The military and police will be poorly equipped to suppress pervasive banditry and kidnapping, particularly in the north-west. Widespread poverty and unemployment are feeding a cycle of crime that will be difficult (if not impossible) to break, given a bleak economic outlook for 2021 at least.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch The next national elections are due in 2023. In the most recent presidential election, in 2019, the candidates of both main parties were from the north, and custom dictates that the candidates in 2023 will be from the south. This should lead to an improvement on the abysmally low turnout in 2019 in the south, which is a stronghold of the main opposition party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP). Frustration with high prices, declining living standards and perpetual instability will be directed at the APC, giving the PDP a winning edge.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations Nigeria will remain a major player in Sub-Saharan Africa given its size, but its domestic challenges tend to keep policymakers inwardly focused. Exasperation over smuggling, which policymakers view as undermining local industry, led the government to close all of Nigeria's land borders to goods traffic in late 2019. Given rising local prices in Nigeria for agricultural goods (and so declining international competitiveness), there will be no rush to open the economy up to food imports, even with Nigeria having ratified the African Continental Free Trade Agreement in November, which will probably cause goods traffic to resume for other sectors from 2021. Protectionism (underpinned by foreign-exchange restrictions) also makes Nigeria's adoption of a common West African currency, the eco, highly unlikely.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends As part of its response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the government has sought about US$6.9bn (about 2% of GDP) from multilateral lenders. Not all the loans are low-conditionality, encouraging Mr Buhari to enact the boldest economic reforms of his tenure. A cap on pump prices has been removed, allowing petrol prices to rise to record levels (for Nigeria). Ending petrol price caps is essential for freeing up fiscal space, and new refineries that are either being built or at the planning stage (including a 650,000-barrel/day facility currently under construction) will require pricing to be suitable for supply to the domestic market. Electricity tariffs are also being raised for usage exceeding 12 hours a day. Attaining cost-reflective electricity tariffs is crucial for alleviating the burden of bad debts that have been run up along the power supply chain, which have hindered investment and resulted in regular outages.
However, political pressures mean the government may well fail to keep prices liberal on a permanent basis. Recent protests in southern Nigeria are partially a product of price reforms, fitting into a wider exasperation over declining living standards, and political pressure has already prompted a scaling down of electricity price increases. Reinstatement of petrol price controls is made less likely by a new Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), which has a good chance of passing through parliament. The legislation is likely to streamline sector-wide regulation in the process of creating a new, profit-oriented national oil company. The PIB will encourage upstream oil investment by making fiscal terms clearer for multinationals. The downstream industry should also become commercially viable from this reorganisation of the sector, allowing Nigeria to wean itself off petrol imports as new refinery capacity comes on stream (which we expect to happen by 2022). However, it is relatively easier to keep electricity tariffs regulated. We do not expect sustained price increases-which would be needed to make the sector financially sound-and the power sector is therefore expected to remain dysfunctional, with electricity undersupply continuing to hinder industry.
Another policy-area which will be shrouded in considerable uncertainty is management of the naira. Low foreign-exchange inflows-reflecting low global oil prices-has provided scope for unifying the overvalued official exchange rate (used for government transactions) and the more market-determined Nigerian autonomous foreign-exchange fixing (NAFEX) rate, thereby raising local-currency fiscal receipts from crude oil. However, there remains a spread between these and the black-market exchange rate, underlining market distortions. Rather than let the naira weaken on a sustained basis or clear a large foreign exchange order backlog by depleting reserves, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has widened an array of currency restrictions and let market turnover contract (widening the spread between the NAFEX and parallel rates) to modulate the pace of outflows. Such policies will sustain foreign-exchange illiquidity into 2021 as oil prices stay low, obstructing capital repatriation for investors via official channels and dampening inflows, underscoring the CBN's resolve for a managed currency regime, despite the circumstances. When foreign-exchange availability improves and the current account returns to surplus, which we expect in 2022, the official rate is likely to again be quoted at a discount to the NAFEX. The idea of a single market rate has been proposed before (most recently in 2016) only to be jettisoned once foreign reserves increased, and the government only plans to manage the exchange-rate regime "sustainably" in the long run. An overvalued official exchange rate allows sectors deemed economically important, namely agriculture and manufacturing, to be subsidised, and fits an agenda of job creation and self-sufficiency through protectionism. A ban on accessing foreign exchange to purchase various imports (currently covering 45 items) is another arm of this strategy. From an investor perspective, the managed nature of the exchange-rate regime poses a risk of capital controls, especially when oil prices are low, as they will be in 2021. We expect the long-term impact of the currency regime on investor confidence to prevent foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows from exceeding 1% of GDP throughout the forecast period.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy We expect the fiscal balance to stay in deficit in 2021-25. Crude oil receipts comprise more than 50% of the federal government's retained income, indicating a continued revenue crunch as oil prices stay low in 2021. High debt-servicing costs, pressing security needs and a large public wage bill will elevate expenditure throughout the forecast period. Widespread tax avoidance and low oil prices compared with the 2010-14 super-cycle will keep federally retained revenue below 4% of GDP throughout 2021-25.
Capital expenditure for the purposes of stimulus will be emphasised in 2021 now that subsidies (which are taken from revenue) have been reduced. This increase in fixed investment will be relatively small, but given low oil prices and so fiscal receipts, we expect a deficit equivalent to 3.1% of GDP. Higher oil prices will stabilise the deficit in 2022, despite a pre-election increase in spending, particularly on security. With a probable rise in value-added tax (VAT) rates (to curb a hazardously high debt-revenue ratio) after the 2023 elections, and oil prices continuing to rise, the deficit will shrink to 2.9% of GDP in 2023 and 2.7% in 2024, before widening to 3% of GDP in 2025 as oil prices fall.
As interest rates are currently low for the sovereign, domestic debt will be more attractive in the near-to-medium term. The government also wants to secure multilateral loans, but as these fall short of the officially expected quantum, we expect the government to return to the international capital market from 2021.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy The CBN will fail to prevent inflation from exceeding its target ceiling of 9% over much of the forecast period, and its policy decisions are likely to be erratic. In the context of a probable recession and limited fiscal firepower, it decided to cut the policy rate by 100 basis points to 11.5% in September (after a 100-basis-point cut in May), despite an upward trend in annual inflation, to 13.2% in August. The strategy is to boost the supply side of the real economy to bring inflation back under control. In our view this is misguided; high and rising inflation will frustrate an economic recovery, and issues such as inadequate public infrastructure, hard-currency shortages and rampant instability need to be addressed before the supply side can moderate the price level. Our expectation is for high inflation to persist, compelling the CBN to raise interest rates once the current economic crisis passes. We expect this to happen in 2022, with easing resuming only in 2024 when inflation has fallen appreciably.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth The economy is expected to exit recession in 2021 as the impact of lockdown in 2020 fades, but high inflation will impede improvements in the business sentiment and dampen real purchasing power amid low productivity, underemployment and low nominal wage growth. Fiscal stimulus will be an inadequate counterforce, given budget constraints, and loosened monetary policy (despite high inflation) will contribute to ongoing exchange-rate scarcity and further undermine macroeconomic stability. Oil production will, however, rise slightly as quotas agreed by OPEC+ (comprising OPEC and a group of non-OPEC countries) are relaxed, and given an uptick in oil exports we expect growth of 1.2% in 2021.
The CBN is expected to tighten monetary policy from 2022, which will circumscribe the nascent economic recovery, but the exchange rate will stabilise and inflation should ease. As non-business financial penetration is low, private consumption will recover alongside disinflation even as interest rates rise. OPEC+ quotas will be raised from April that year and new refining capacity is expected to come on stream in earnest, boosting real exports (with some output for the regional market) and reducing imports. Consequently, we expect growth of 3.1% in 2022. As refinery output continues to ramp up, crude oil exports rise, inflation falls and real spending power recovers, growth will pick up to an annual average of 3.8% in 2023-24. However, these rates of growth are well below potential. The economy will continue to lack dynamism owing to high interest rates, low FDI, high unemployment, pervasive instability in agricultural regions and infrastructure deficiencies, particularly regarding stable power supply. A more challenging year is forecast for 2025 as oil prices fall sharply and macroeconomic uncertainty rises, with growth slipping back to 1.6%.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation Looser monetary policy (which will lead to currency adjustments), combined with higher fuel and electricity tariffs, foreign-exchange restrictions on various imported goods-including staple foods-and devaluation of the naira will raise inflation to an average of 16% in 2021, rising on both core and non-core levels. Assuming that rising oil prices stabilise the exchange rate, and the CBN eventually tightens monetary policy, we expect the annual inflation rate to fall throughout 2022-25, to 8.5% at end-2025. Conflict and agricultural supply disruptions in the Middle Belt-Nigeria's breadbasket-as well as foreign-exchange controls on imported goods will prevent a faster fall.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates The CBN is supplying foreign exchange to regulated trading windows but only fitfully, and a large unmet order book for foreign exchange from exporters. Assuming that oil prices stay low in 2021 and with low domestic interest rates sustaining capital outflow pressures, activated as and when the CBN drip feeds foreign exchange to official windows, we expect a devaluation of the official rate in that year (following two adjustments in 2020). This will take the naira from N379:US$1 at end-2020 to N450:US$1 at end-2021. The official and NAFEX rates will be broadly unified in the process. For the remainder of the forecast period the official exchange rate to the US dollar is expected to be kept relatively stable. Monetary tightening in Nigeria will again encourage hot money inflows, higher oil prices will boost foreign exchange access (lessening concerns over capital controls), and the current account is forecast to return to surplus. Divergence between official and NAFEX rates is likely to re-emerge, but the CBN should be able to supply adequate liquidity to regulated foreign-exchange channels, broadly stabilising the market even as world oil prices (and so net foreign-exchange inflows) fluctuate.
Forecasting the naira Although The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts both the official and the secondary market rates, it is the official rate that appears in most of its data presentations, as this is the longest-running and best-tracked variable. The official rate also best represents exchange-rate policy. Indicators that are converted into US dollars at the official rate are essentially overvalued, which is in line with official calculations.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector An export slump due to low world oil prices and OPEC+ production quotas will keep the current account in deficit in 2021, for a third consecutive year (a stretch unseen since the early 1990s), with a shortfall of 2.1% of GDP expected. This is despite a slight uptick in imports of goods and services as the economy recovers and coronavirus-related travel restrictions imposed in 2020 are lifted, with a devalued naira restraining the increase. Over the remainder of the forecast period a current-account surplus is expected. Oil prices are projected to rise in 2022-23, which will expand exports, while lower petroleum import volumes as new domestic refinery capacity comes on stream will constrain the import bill. Remittances from the large Nigerian diaspora should also increase as the coronavirus crisis passes globally. This will all contribute to an annual average current-account surplus of 0.9% of GDP in 2022-24. The surplus will then ebb to 0.7% of GDP in 2025 as falling oil prices push down export earnings and continued real effective exchange-rate appreciation and monetary easing cause imports to continue to rise. The deficit in 2021 will be financed largely by debt inflows, with investment inflows being limited by a dysfunctional foreign-exchange market in that year.

Full text: - Despite Venezuela's socioeconomic collapse and the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, to retain power throughout the 2021-25 forecast period. Mr Maduro's position will be supported primarily by his grip over a complex security apparatus and the opposition's lack of de facto power. On this basis, we expect continued deterioration of the economy, sustained outward migration, and a poorer and more violent Venezuela. Despite US sanctions (and their impact on oil production), the Maduro regime has managed internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through its strict control over the security forces.
- The scale of the socioeconomic collapse and the elevated level of political instability will ensure that the Maduro regime continues to be challenged both economically and politically. Low international crude prices, combined with US sanctions on the regime, mean that Venezuela is struggling to place its oil exports abroad. We therefore forecast that domestic crude production will average less than 400,000 barrels/day in the coming months. Mr Maduro will continue to face challenges to maintain the current patronage system and remain in control. That said, his position will strengthen in 2021, as the opposition is set to lose control of the legislature in January following rigged legislative elections on December 6th 2020.
- De facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding. Concurrently, the government has taken measures that have allowed the official exchange rate to float. These measures have to date aided price stability and therefore increased the availability of some basic goods. However, the measures are not a product of economic orthodoxy, but of policy decisions to ensure the regime's survival. We do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that will be required to resolve Venezuela's economic crisis within the forecast period.

- Venezuela ranks 82nd of 82 countries in the global business environment rankings for 2021-25, having been in 80th place in the 2016-20 historical period, as the economic crisis deepens despite minor improvements. Reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment are unlikely.

Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Expansion of interventionist measures, including price controls. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and continue to undermine free competition.
2023-25: Contract rights remain weak, and red tape and ad hoc interventionism continue.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Most attempts to attract investment prove unsuccessful, owing to political and economic instability.
2023-25: Actual investment flows remain low amid ongoing economic volatility. Intellectual property protection and private property rights deteriorate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Currency controls are weakened, but access to foreign currency remains limited.
2023-25: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, and de facto dollarisation advances. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves as oil prices rise, albeit slowly.
Taxes 2021-22: Risk of further unrest and political instability reduces probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major rise in public spending.
2023-25: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2021-22: Inflation remains high and concerns surrounding economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2023-25: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2021-22: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Past emigration of skilled labour aggravates skills shortages.
2023-25: Labour-market rigidities persist, despite some increase in flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Underinvestment in water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts.
2023-25: Investors remain highly cautious about committing to long-term capital projects. Infrastructure deteriorates even further.
Technological readiness 2021-22: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment, but with little interest.
2023-25: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to restrict internet and mobile coverage.

Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013 proved unsuccessful. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his own popularity plummet as his macroeconomic mismanagement, combined with strict sanctions on trade from the US, has plunged the country into a severe economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature to be in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country) has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports, and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$20.9bn in 2018 as the destruction of domestic supply led to increasing import dependence. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates the 2019 current-account surplus at 2.4% of GDP.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), to retain power throughout 2021 despite social and economic shocks. However, the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, diminished oil rents-resulting from US sanctions and low international oil prices-and goods shortages all represent hefty challenges to the survival of the military regime. In addition, social unrest is prevalent and protests could intensify in the coming months owing to severe fuel shortages and the forthcoming legislative elections on December 6th. Nonetheless, Mr Maduro has a number of factors working in his favour. The regime retains strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces; this control-together with the complexity of the security apparatus and recurrent purges within it-will allow the regime to manage internal dissent.
Another reason to believe that Mr Maduro will retain power is the state of the opposition led by the head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó. It has lost the momentum that it had in 2019 and Mr Guaidó's political capital is currently low-a recent poll by Datanálisis (a local pollster) gave him an approval rating of just 25%, compared with 15% for Mr Maduro. Moreover, Mr Maduro is poised to retake the legislature from the opposition in the forthcoming legislative elections. Given that the polls are unlikely to be neither free nor fair, the opposition is likely to seek to extend the current legislative term. However, there is no constitutional basis for an extension and the PSUV's victory in the rigged polls will complicate the opposition's strategy and Mr Guaidó's claim to power, leaving Mr Maduro in a stronger position than a year ago.
Mr Maduro's recent actions illustrate his strong hand relative to the opposition. A new electoral council, inaugurated in June, was packed with Mr Maduro's allies. Even more audaciously, the Supreme Court ejected the leadership of several prominent opposition parties (including Acción Democrática and Voluntad Popular-Mr Guaidó's own party) and replaced them with a group of politicians who claim to be part of the opposition but who are in reality loyal to the regime. The brazenness of these actions shows that Mr Maduro is unperturbed by the prospect of retaliation by the opposition and that political pressure on him is wavering.
Despite all of this, we recognise that there is a high risk to our forecasts, and that the deteriorating economic situation could prompt some sort of political transition. There are three main paths to a change of government: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We believe that the prospect of military action by the US or Colombia is low, and that a negotiated transition would also be difficult, as trust issues between the two sides are insurmountable. Bearing this in mind, we believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The regime's main weakness is the fragility of its internal finances. Its patronage system is crucial for sustaining its security apparatus and resisting social unrest. Low international crude prices, US sanctions and the dampening effect of a global recession on workers' remittances will shrink US dollar inflows further. The regime will continue to benefit from funds from drug trafficking and illegal mining activities, but a lack of hard currency could prove fatal to the patronage system and will test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks. The regime's liquidity problems-along with a rapidly worsening socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis-could prompt putsch attempts in the near term.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch Legislative elections will take place on December 6th. These polls will be neither free nor fair, and the opposition will lose control of the National Assembly. Most opposition forces plan to boycott the elections, given the lack of electoral guarantees; however, this same strategy has in the past only managed to reduce their visibility, influence and legitimacy. Moreover, the opposition plans to hold an "anti-Maduro" referendum on December 5th-12th, asking participants whether or not to denounce the illegality of the legislative elections, and call for free and fair polls. Nevertheless, these efforts are likely to yield only low turnout owing to the opposition's diminished political capital and the risk of repression from state forces.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations Mr Guaidó has marshalled strong support from the international community, but efforts by most governments in Latin America to support him have reached an impasse. Immediately after the opposition loses control of the legislature in January 2021, most countries will continue to recognise Mr Guaidó as the interim president; however, governments are likely to gradually reinstate diplomatic ties with the Maduro regime given the opposition's lack of de facto power. The US has instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions to put enough pressure on the regime's finances (and therefore on its patronage system) to force Mr Maduro to hold free and fair elections; however, these are unlikely in the medium term. The incoming US administration of Joe Biden will remain hawkish in its approach to Venezuela, but we believe that a military intervention is unlikely. We expect most US sanctions to remain in place owing to strong bipartisan support; however, some-such as the recently approved ban on diesel swaps-could be lifted. We also anticipate that diplomatic efforts to reach a negotiated exit for Mr Maduro will increase under a Biden administration.
Iran has recently become Mr Maduro's main international backer. Since April, Iran has sent more than 2.5m barrels of petrol to Venezuela (in exchange for gold shipments) to alleviate the country's severe fuel shortages; more tankers are set to arrive in the coming weeks. Iran is also helping Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA, the state-owned oil company) to repair the Paraguaná oil refinery.
Nevertheless, Russia and China (both strong Venezuelan allies) seem unwilling to provide the financing-amounting to tens of billions of US dollars per year-required to stabilise the economy and secure PDVSA's long-term future. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries but has had little success in securing finance for investment. If a transition from the regime were to come about, we believe that Russia and China would be willing to work with Mr Maduro's successor to protect their current investments.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends The Maduro regime will focus on weathering ongoing fuel shortages that have crippled the economy and on containing the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Despite community spread and an accelerating number of Covid-19 cases, Mr Maduro has eased nationwide quarantine measures to some degree. Measures will remain in place over the short to medium term, as the health system is simply unprepared to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. Venezuela's medical infrastructure is poor and hospitals face significant shortages of water, soap, medicines and electricity.
Given its potential to ignite large-scale protests, Mr Maduro has taken some steps to alleviate fuel scarcity. In May the regime announced a two-tiered petrol distribution system. Drivers are subject to a monthly quota of subsidised petrol. When this has been reached, petrol will be available at internationally indexed prices. The quota system seeks to regularise black-market activity so that the regime (rather than a third party) benefits from the gains. Concurrently, the Maduro regime is seeking to switch on domestic petrol production. PDVSA is currently only able to produce an estimated 20,000 barrels/day (b/d) of petrol (at its peak it could refine 1.3m b/d) and efforts to boost production are often marred by infrastructure breakdowns. However, these actions will only work to an extent, as arbitrage opportunities are still possible under the new subsidy system and domestic petrol production meets only a slim proportion of local demand (about 25% of current demand).
Based on our view that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout our 2021-25 forecast period, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that are required to resolve the economic crisis. De facto dollarisation is expanding; although this was not a tacit goal for the regime, Mr Maduro now welcomes it. Other under-the-radar adjustments are possible in the coming years as long as these benefit the regime's survival. Such efforts alone are unlikely to bring about economic stability, owing to the absence of comprehensive microeconomic reform or improvements in the rule of law; policy predictability will not be forthcoming under the current regime.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy The authorities have not published complete data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect the non-financial public-sector deficit to narrow in 2021, and the public debt/GDP ratio to remain high in the coming years. The sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will curb government spending. The regime relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Money printing will continue to finance the government's deficits in 2021-25. However, in the medium term, growing remittance inflows will somewhat offset the need to monetise budget deficits. We currently assume no debt restructuring in 2021-25. Venezuela's weak fiscal position is complicated by the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing-mainly PDVSA-issued debt and development funds from China-that understates the true size of total public liabilities.
All of the sovereign's outstanding global bonds are in arrears. Indeed, a US court has ruled that PDVSA is an "alter ego" of the Venezuelan government; this will have far-reaching implications, as some international firms are seeking to seize shares of Citgo stock. The key PDVSA 2020 bond, which was secured using 50.1% of the shares of Citgo (PDVSA's US subsidiary) as collateral, fell due at end-October 2019 and was not paid. Bondholders of the PDVSA 2020 are currently unable to seek to attach assets owing to an ongoing suspension by the US Treasury. Nevertheless, there is a strong possibility that the opposition, which currently holds Citgo, will lose control of it to bondholders in early 2021.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy The government's financing needs will force the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) to ramp up money printing in the short term. Growing dollarisation and a strong contraction in domestic demand slowed hyperinflationary pressures in 2019-20. This trend will continue in 2021, but hyperinflationary pressures will remain significant owing to the monetisation of large fiscal deficits and severe goods shortages. Hyperinflation will continue until its underlying causes are addressed. It has quickened the pace of dollarisation of the economy (more than 60% of transactions are now thought to be conducted in US dollars). We believe that Venezuela is heading towards overall de facto dollarisation.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 30.3% in 2020 (and a cumulative contraction of almost 77% since 2013), we forecast an additional 1.7% decline in GDP in 2021. GDP is now strongly correlated with oil output and export. Following plummeting oil exports in 2019-20, crude production will stabilise as global energy demand starts to recover. Concurrently, the non-oil economy will benefit from the lifting of social distancing measures in 2021 and from larger fuel supplies (even though domestic petrol production will not fully cover local demand). From a demand-side perspective, the GDP contraction will be driven by falling real incomes, hyperinflation and continued mass emigration (fuelled by unemployment, violence and social instability). Low crude prices and weak oil exports will continue to threaten crude production. Venezuela's average break-even price is about US$15-20/barrel. US sanctions on the regime raise the risks involved in dealing with Venezuela, forcing the country to offer a hefty discount on its crude. This means that, at current market prices, Venezuela is making only a limited profit (its oil basket traded at an estimated US$25/b as at end-October). The current circumstances have inevitably led to production cuts; according to OPEC, oil output fell to 350,000 b/d in October 2020, from 700,000 b/d in October 2019 and 1.3m b/d in October 2018. We believe that average output will remain below 400,000 b/d over the coming months.
In 2022 we expect economic growth to return on the back of a surge in oil prices. Despite serious operational problems (such as difficulties in obtaining equipment for repairs or finding qualified staff) and a limited pool of suitable buyers of Venezuelan crude, oil output will recover partly in the medium term as producers adapt to post-sanctions export markets. Furthermore, relative macroeconomic stability will allow the non-oil economy to recover marginally in the medium term. Nonetheless, we assume that Venezuela's GDP (in real terms) will be only about half of its 2018 level, even in 2025. There are substantial risks to our forecasts, which assume that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout 2021-25.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation A severely reduced domestic goods supply, constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits will continue to stoke hyperinflation in 2021. Social distancing measures, dollarisation and heavy credit restrictions imposed by the regime have helped to subdue inflation this year, keeping it at bay. Consumer prices rose by 23.8% month on month in October; however, inflationary pressures will strengthen in the short term, owing to fuel scarcity, price controls, extraordinary pre-election spending, the ramping up of money printing by the government and the latest minimum wage increment. In early November the Maduro regime trebled the monthly minimum wage-to which wages of a sizeable share of the labour force are directly or indirectly linked-to BsS1.2m (US$1.90).
In the medium term, inflation will remain high for as long as the Maduro regime is in power, given huge fundamental imbalances between supply and demand, and the need for the regime to monetise its fiscal deficits. Weather-related shocks are a perennial risk to the inflation outlook. However, dollarisation will tame hyperinflationary pressures, and inflationary pressures will ease gradually over the coming years.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates Hyperinflation will sustain bolívar depreciation in 2021. Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency denomination (as in March 2018) or a new currency is a strong possibility. In mid-2019 the regime announced a loosening of currency controls. Although this was a positive move, significant barriers limit access to US dollars via formal means. We still believe that the government will maintain a number of indirect controls on the foreign-exchange market. In this environment, a black-market exchange-rate premium is inevitable.
In late November bolívar depreciation accelerated notably owing to extraordinary spending ahead of the legislative polls, with the official exchange rate reaching BsS1,030,000:US$1 (against a black-market rate of BsS1,240,000:US$1) on November 27th. The current premium (17%) is much larger than in recent months, suggesting that there is room for further significant bolívar depreciation in the coming weeks and months.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector Venezuela will post a small current-account deficit of 0.9% of GDP in 2021, owing to weak oil exports and limited remittance inflows resulting from the global recession. Official BCV figures for 2017-18 show that Venezuela posted current-account surpluses in this period.
In 2019-20 the collapse of goods export earnings (owing to US sanctions on the oil trade) hit the trade balance hard. Nevertheless, based on the latest data, we estimate that the export collapse was mostly covered by growing inflows of workers' remittances and the non-payment of interest on bonded debt (saving in excess of US$5bn in 2019).
We expect the current account to return to surplus in the medium term, averaging 4.5% of GDP in 2022-25. Goods exports will recover as international oil prices increase and the country steps up trade with Asian markets. The recovery in the current account will be supported by continued weakness in domestic demand, rising remittances from abroad and the fact that the sovereign will remain in default throughout the forecast period.

Full text: - The right-wing government of the president, Jair Bolsonaro, has built an alliance with centrist parties in order to bolster governability in Brazil's highly fragmented Congress and to advance his economic reform and socially conservative agenda. Tensions with the judiciary will simmer as the authorities investigate the affairs of the president's three sons.
- Economic policymaking will be guided by the need to manage the health and economic impact of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Fiscal, monetary and credit stimulus will be hefty, leaving considerable consolidation challenges in the recovery period. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the fiscal deficit will widen to almost 16% of GDP in 2020, lifting the public debt/GDP ratio to nearly 100% by 2021. Assuming recovery and consolidation thereafter, we expect this ratio to stabilise.
- Despite the economy recovering since activity hit its lowest point in April (at the height of lockdown restrictions), GDP will fall by an estimated 5% in 2020, before recovering partly in 2021, growing by 3.7%. GDP growth will average 2% annually in 2022-25. Despite policy accommodation, Brazil's productive capacity will be damaged by the crisis, impairing medium-term potential growth.
- We expect inflation to remain below the 4% mid-point target in 2020 as recession and low energy prices offset higher import costs owing to a weaker currency. However, disruptions in food supplies or logistics could cause inflation to overshoot. Inflation will remain around the declining mid-point target (3.75% in 2021, 3.5% in 2022 and 3.25% in 2023) over the medium term.
- Assuming that international risk aversion eases once the coronavirus pandemic abates, we expect the Brazilian Real to recoup this year's losses, trading at below R5:US$1 from 2022. Import compression will offset weaker exports in 2020, but we estimate that lower profit remittances and a narrower net tourism deficit owing to travel restrictions will reduce the current-account deficit to less than 1% of GDP this year. Assuming a recovery, the deficit will widen to beyond 3% by 2024.
- Following recession in 2020, a projected recovery will expand Brazil's large domestic market above US$2trn by 2025. Notwithstanding some simplifications, the tax system will remain burdensome and one of the weakest areas of the business environment. Infrastructure investment through a concessions prog-ramme will help to ease logistical bottlenecks, but upgrades and extensions will materialise only slowly.

- Fiscal consolidation needs after hefty stimulus during the coronavirus pandemic and the 2022 electoral cycle will complicate government efforts to improve the business environment and enact structural reforms. Brazil's large economy is attractive, but poor government effectiveness, a burdensome tax system, archaic infrastructure, deficiencies in factor markets and skills shortages will impair business.

Country forecast overview: Brazil's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Vested interests slow down economy ministry's ambitious privatisations programme, although some divestments do materialise.
2023-25: Privatisations continue slowly. Fiscal pressures encourage private capital in infrastructure projects. Investment Partnerships Programme (PPI) advances further, with improved legal framework and regulatory agencies.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic hits foreign direct investment (FDI).
2023-25: Ideological issues within current government put nationalist politics ahead of economic pragmatism in certain situations.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Despite anti-globalisation moves in advanced economies, some bilateral and regional trade negotiations progress. Deal between EU and Mercosul (Southern Cone customs union comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) not expected to be ratified by EU parliaments.
2023-25: Steps taken to make Brazilian Real a fully convertible currency.
Taxes 2021-22: Post-coronavirus consolidation needs may lead to higher taxes.
2023-25: Tax simplification unifies three federal, state and municipal taxes into one value-added tax (VAT).
Financing 2021-22: Financial system weathers pandemic; Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank) provides emergency credit. BCB gains independence, improving efficiency and competitiveness, reducing borrowing costs. Credit resumes after crisis.
2023-25: Renewed growth in domestic equity and bond issuance as state banks dial back subsidised credit lines.
The labour market 2021-22: Unemployment surges owing to pandemic. Government implements further measures to reduce cost of labour.
2023-25: Steps to boost long-term labour productivity complicated by continued weak education policies.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Infrastructure concessions advance (through PPI), but coronavirus, and political and institutional constraints may cause delays. Corruption and recession weigh on established construction companies, opening industry up for newcomers.
2023-25: Industry newcomers' lack of experience causes project delays.
Technological readiness 2021-22: Fifth-generation (5G) frequencies to be auctioned in 2021. Quality of communications rises as demand expands.
2023-25: Building of 5G infrastructure network commences and is rolled out to consumers.

Background: A new constitution was ratified in 1988 after more than 20 years of military rule. The government of Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995-2002) ended hyperinflation and advanced reforms to liberalise the economy. Under a former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-10), Brazil reaped the benefits of the reforms and enjoyed a consumer-led, commodities-fuelled boom. When this cycle ended, discontent owing to a weak economy, corruption and poor public services led to street protests. Lula's successor as president, Dilma Rousseff (2011-16), nonetheless won a second four-year term in 2014, but was impeached in 2016 over budget irregularities. Her vice-president, Michel Temer (2016-18), finished her term. Jair Bolsonaro won the October 2018 election and took office as president in January 2019.
Political structure: The president executes policy approved by the 513-seat Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and the 81-seat Senate (the upper house). Constitutional review is conducted by an independent judiciary. Although the president can resort to temporary decrees to push through legislation, the constitution gives Congress ample scope to check the executive. In the lower house, 30 political parties are represented and party discipline has traditionally been weak.
Policy issues: The benefits and entitlements established under the 1988 constitution have contributed to a doubling in central government primary spending, to over 27% of GDP. Congress passed a federal spending cap in 2016 and a robust pension reform in October 2019. The Banco Central do Brasil (the central bank) cut the Selic policy rate to 2% in August, a record low. The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic is leading to expansionary fiscal, monetary and credit policies to offset the hit to the economy and financial system; The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the public debt/GDP ratio will exceed 95% in 2020.
Taxation: Brazil has a poorly structured revenue system, characterised by a heavy tax burden, a narrow tax base, complicated levies and widespread evasion. Both foreign and domestic companies employ tax professionals and devote considerable resources to managing their tax affairs. The corporate and indirect tax systems are particularly complex, porous and unwieldy; the income tax system is considered to be relatively efficient, with a top rate of 27.5%.
Foreign trade: The pandemic-induced recession and a weaker Real are narrowing the current-account deficit, which we estimate at 0.8% of GDP in 2020. Agricultural exports support a moderate structural trade surplus.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability The political environment in 2021 will be shaped by the deployment of vaccines to overcome the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and by the efforts of the right-wing, populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, to maintain his new-found popularity among poorer Brazilians (stemming from emergency Covid-19 assistance payments) and consolidate his alliances with the centrão, a group of centrist parties that performed well in the November local elections and that hold the key to control of Congress. Their support-in exchange for political favours, including government posts for their members and budget allocations-will help the president to advance his socially conservative agenda and ward off potential impeachment risks. These risks have subsided recently, after emerging in early 2020 owing to the president's confrontational rhetoric against Congress and the Supreme Court, but could re-emerge as Mr Bolsonaro's political rivals seek to undermine his October 2022 re-election bid. Although his new alliances will bolster his position, the president's loose governing coalition in the legislature will face challenges from more progressive centre-right parties. These parties will want to secure the leadership of the lower house when an election for that position is held in February 2021 in order to control the legislative agenda and exert their influence, and because they will potentially back their own presidential candidate. Meanwhile, Mr Bolsonaro's alliance with the centrão reduces the impetus for market reforms espoused by his free-market economy minister, Paulo Guedes, and could weaken fiscal discipline.
Despite having the world's second-highest Covid-19 death toll (173,000 and rising as at end-November), the president's ploy of outsourcing the handling of the pandemic to other levels of government has not resulted in a loss of personal popularity, as state governors and local officials implementing social distancing measures have absorbed most of the associated political costs and income losses. According to a local pollster, XP Ipespe, the president's approval rating rose to 39% in October, from about 32% before the coronavirus outbreak. This was mostly due to government income transfers that have attracted support from a new-found low-income base; this has compensated for lost support from voters who were attracted by the president's anti-corruption election rhetoric but now consider it largely empty. In this context, Mr Bolsonaro appears to believe that if he retains the support of his core conservative voters and of lower-income voters through cash transfer programmes (particularly in the populous Northeast), he has a good chance of securing re-election in 2022. However, fiscal pressures will limit social spending.
Mr Bolsonaro's proximity to the military (he is a retired captain) has caused tension, especially with the judiciary. Although The Economist Intelligence Unit expects calm relations for the time being, tensions could flare again, given the president's impetuous nature and investigations swirling around him (relating to alleged political interference in the federal police earlier this year) and around his sons, Carlos (a local councillor, involved in "fake news" campaigns against political opponents) and Flávio (a senator, implicated in a local assembly graft scheme). Not only has the president put retired military officers in important cabinet positions-including Hamilton Mourão as vice-president-and stacked lower-ranking officials in the state bureaucracy, but in early 2020 he also actively supported bolsonaristas who attacked opponents in Congress (as well as in the judiciary and media), and called for military intervention. However, a rupture of constitutional rule is unlikely, as voters would protest; polls suggest that 75% of Brazilians support democracy as the best form of government. Meanwhile, most high-ranking military officials are reluctant to associate too closely with Mr Bolsonaro's political interests.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch The November local elections delivered gains for traditional centrist parties, suggesting that, whatever their opinions of Mr Bolsonaro, voters are unlikely to elect a left-leaning president in October 2022. The field for the presidential race will again be large, but it looks likely to be a re-run of the 2018 vote, with Mr Bolsonaro-probably backed by the centrão-competing against whomever a former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-10), nominates as the candidate of the Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT). This assumes that Lula himself, who was convicted of corruption, does not unexpectedly become eligible to stand. However, the PT performed poorly in the local elections. The PT and other leftist parties are unlikely to unite behind a single candidate, which could reduce the chances of the PT candidate (or other emerging leftist rivals) contesting a probable second-round run-off. This could benefit centrist figures such as João Doria, the governor of São Paulo state. That scenario could lead to a tougher contest for Mr Bolsonaro, although he will have the huge advantages of incumbency. It is too early to make a call; Mr Bolsonaro's standing could be affected by unexpected, negative developments in Brazil's tumultuous political environment. If the president cannot extend well-received cash transfers, his popularity is likely to weaken, diminishing both his ability to broker agreements on structural reforms in Congress in 2021 and his re-election prospects.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations The president's anti-globalist rhetoric and facilitation of illegal deforestation in the Amazon rainforest is tarnishing Brazil's international standing. However, as one of the world's ten largest economies and a major commodity exporter, Brazil will remain a significant global player. Under the presidency of Joe Biden in the US, bilateral relations will be cooler while Mr Bolsonaro is president of Brazil given their divergent stances, particularly regarding climate change and deforestation. We assume that a pragmatic approach will prevail, with common ground on anti-China sentiment.
Brazil will continue to be one of the battlegrounds in US-China rivalry; a fifth-generation (5G) licence auction scheduled for 2021 is likely to prove tricky for the Brazilian government given the local presence of Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications company. Anti-Chinese rhetoric by nationalist government figures is causing bilateral tensions, but military figures will encourage the president to be pragmatic regarding China's acquisition of assets, as Brazil needs investments in major infrastructure and energy projects. We do not expect a free-trade agreement (FTA) between the EU and Mercosul (the Southern Cone customs union comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) to be ratified soon, owing to EU concerns over Mr Bolsonaro's environmental policies. Now that there is also pressure from Mr Biden on environmental issues, Brazil's efforts to join the OECD could be delayed.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends Policymaking in 2020 has focused on containing the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, which is showing signs of picking up again after easing from the June-July peaks; this suggests the risk of a second wave, potentially bringing renewed social distancing restrictions. Pandemic-related emergency economic measures will remain in place to some extent next year, but we expect attention to broadly return to the government's structural reform agenda in the next year, after being overshadowed by the pandemic response. Overall, we expect the government to make only piecemeal progress, as Mr Bolsonaro's own commitment to these reforms and to fiscal consolidation appears to be waning; he is prioritising his alliance with centrão parties (which resist Mr Guedes's more ambitious, free-market reforms) and his 2022 re-election bid.
The government will focus primarily on passing revenue-neutral tax simp-lification reforms to unify three or more consumption taxes into a single value-added tax (VAT); Mr Guedes has almost entirely given up his efforts to levy a new 0.2% digital payments tax to finance a reduction in payroll costs amid widespread congressional resistance. The government will attempt to make progress on other structural reforms proposed by Mr Guedes-including streamlining the public sector, bringing greater order and flexibility to budget management and carrying out privatisations. The government presented a watered-down version of its administrative reform (which includes the elimination of job security for most future public servants) to Congress in September in the latest signal that the economy minister's agenda will be diluted. Although the electoral complication of the municipal polls has now been overcome, there is a very small window of opportunity (until mid-2021) to press on with any reforms before attention turns to the 2022 presidential race. However, we expect a broadly revenue-neutral tax simplification reform, possibly including changes to tax rates.
Overshadowing any government initiative will be the need to consolidate the public finances, given the high and rising public debt/GDP ratio (91% in September) and increasing fears in financial markets that the government will breach its constitutionally mandated public spending cap. Policymakers have deployed huge fiscal stimulus in 2020 (about 8% of GDP directly, and even more including below-the-line items and government guarantees) to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, including monthly cash transfers of R600 (US$115) to more than 60m informal workers until September (now dialled down to R300 for the rest of 2020). As the transfers have buoyed Mr Bolsonaro's popularity among the poor, he has sensed an opportunity to boost his chances of re-election in 2022 by continuing the programme in 2021. With limited room in the budget to do so, there is an increasing risk that Brazil's fiscal rules will be broken. Although this is not currently our baseline forecast, such a development would risk triggering much greater debt-sustainability concerns, along with higher inflation and interest rates than we currently forecast.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy After surging to an estimated 96% in 2020 owing to pandemic-related support measures, currency depreciation and recession, the public debt/GDP ratio will grow to 98% in 2021 as fiscal revenue only partly recovers. Stopping a more substantial rise will require consolidation measures; otherwise, concerns about debt sustainability will re-emerge among investors, raising the country risk premium. The government will want to avoid raising taxes ahead of the 2022 election, but tax increases before the end of our 2021-25 forecast period cannot be ruled out. The "state of calamity" approved by Congress amid the pandemic allows the government to sidestep constitutionally mandated fiscal rules in 2020 and increase spending, but an extension of this in 2021 (a growing possibility, albeit not currently our baseline forecast) would unnerve investors. The fiscal hit from the crisis is apparent in the widening of the 12-month rolling overall deficit, to 13.7% of GDP in September. We expect measures to be mostly removed in 2021; the deficit will narrow to 7.5% of GDP as revenue increases. Consolidation of these trends will narrow the deficit to less than 5% of GDP on average in 2022-25. We anticipate that public debt will stabilise within the forecast period, helped by privatisation proceeds and currency revaluation, but there is a growing risk that debt will exceed 100% if the president yields to an election-related increase in spending.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy Policy accommodation during the 2020 crisis will give way to a normalisation process beginning later in 2021 as the economy begins to recover. The Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank) cut the Selic policy rate to 2% (a record low) in August. With rates considered close to the lower bound for Brazil, further easing is unlikely. We expect the BCB to gain formal independence soon (the upper house approved the bill on November 3rd and it now passes to the lower house). As the economy recovers over 2021-25, we expect policy normalisation, beginning after mid-2021, to take the Selic close to 5% by 2021 (a real interest rate of 2%, which we consider to be neutral, up from nearly -2% currently). The mid-point inflation target will fall by 25 basis points each year in 2020-23, from 4% to 3.25% (the 2024 target will be set in 2021 and could fall further). The most significant risk to the environment of low interest rates and inflation is an unexpected abandonment of the 2016 spending cap rules.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth Following an estimated 5% contraction in 2020, real GDP will recover partially in 2021, when we expect an expansion of 3.7%, assuming that major corona-virus lockdowns are avoided until a vaccine is deployed. However, growth in 2021 will be mostly due to strong statistical effects from the 2020 rebound and sequential growth will actually be quite weak, owing to the withdrawal of most pandemic-related fiscal stimulus. Although low interest rates and inflation will be supportive factors (along with a recovering global economy), lasting damage to the productive sector and jobs, and to corporate and household balance sheets means that we do not expect output to return to pre-coronavirus levels until 2023. Leading indicators show that the rebound in the third quarter of 2020 (estimated at 7.5% quarter on quarter) is slowing in the fourth (to 3%) as income transfers are dialled down.
Our forecasts assume the approval of tax simplification reforms and progress on other microeconomic reform agenda items, but we recognise that governability risks could hamper advances. The upturn in 2021-25 will be driven by stronger investment (buoyed by lower interest rates, privatisations and infrastructure concessions) and by private consumption, supported by lower interest rates and credit growth. The withdrawal of emergency cash transfers in 2021 will initially be offset by the use of household savings (which actually rose in 2020) until the jobs market strengthens later in the year. Commodity exports will accelerate in 2021-25, in line with a recovery in global demand. Manufacturing has already rebounded from the coronavirus hit owing to stimulus for consumers and a weaker currency-a factor that will continue to make goods more competitive against imports over the forecast period. The recovery of services sectors will not fully materialise until successful deployment of a vaccine in 2021 removes the need for social distancing measures.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation A stronger policy framework than in the past will help to anchor inflation expectations, and minimum-wage increases are unlikely to be much above inflation (if at all). Fiscal expansion amid the pandemic will need to be brought under control or inflation expectations will become unanchored. We consider that the recent uptick in inflation (3.9% in October)-related to higher food and commodity prices, as well as a weaker currency and higher demand created by emergency cash transfers-will be transitory. Assuming a gradual economic recovery in 2021-25, and barring periodic weather-related food shortages, an unexpected surge in oil prices or fiscal slippage, inflation should fluctuate close to the (lower) mid-point targets for 2021 (3.75%), 2022 (3.5%) and 2023 (3.25%). The 2024 target will be set in mid-2021 and could fall to 3%.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates Swings in global conditions and jitters over fiscal risks will keep the Real volatile, but it should regain some of its recent losses over the medium term. After ending 2020 at R5.3:US$1-about 25% weaker than at end-2019-we expect the Real to trade mostly around R4.9-5.2:US$1 in 2021-25, fluctuating in line with Brazil's terms of trade, interest-rate differentials and global risk sentiment. A deeper local capital market for long-term debt will discourage corporate external borrowing, reducing capital inflows. The main risk to our forecast stems from the possibility of a market sell-off if confidence in debt sustainability evaporates.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector Risks to Brazil's external position will be assuaged by its modest current-account deficit and external debt ratios, a comfortable reserves cushion and a Real no longer overvalued by high interest rates (as in the past). Public external debt is low and most companies have some sort of currency hedge, despite moderate private external debt. The trade balance will post a large structural surplus during 2021-25, owing to stable commodity exports to China, but this will narrow gradually as imports rise following recession-related compression in 2020.
After narrowing in 2020, the current-account deficit will widen gradually during the forecast period as imports recover in line with the economy, and will exceed 3.6% of GDP by 2025. After dropping to an estimated 3.8% of GDP in 2020, inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) will average 4.2% of GDP in 2021-25, reflecting sizeable market opportunities.

Full text: - Despite Venezuela's socioeconomic collapse and the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the civic-military regime led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela to retain power throughout the 2021-25 forecast period. Mr Maduro's position will be supported primarily by his grip over a complex security apparatus and the opposition's lack of de facto power. On this basis, we expect continued deterioration of the economy, sustained outward migration, and a poorer and more violent Venezuela. Despite US sanctions (and their impact on oil production), the Maduro regime has managed internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through its strict control over the security forces.
- The scale of the socioeconomic collapse and the elevated level of political instability will ensure that the Maduro regime continues to be challenged both economically and politically. Low international crude prices, combined with US sanctions on the regime, mean that Venezuela is struggling to place its oil exports abroad. We therefore forecast that domestic crude production will average less than 400,000 barrels/day in the coming months. Mr Maduro will continue to face challenges to maintain the current patronage system and remain in control. That said, his position will strengthen in 2021, as the opposition is set to lose control of the legislature in January following rigged legislative elections on December 6th 2020.
- De facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding. Concurrently, the government has taken measures that have allowed the official exchange rate to float. These measures have to date aided price stability and therefore increase the availability of some basic goods. However, the measures are not a product of economic orthodoxy, but of policy decisions to ensure the regime's survival. We do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that will be required to resolve Venezuela's economic crisis within the forecast period.

- Venezuela is ranked 82nd of 82 countries in the global business environ-ment rankings for 2021-25, having been in 80th place in the 2016-20 historical period, as the economic crisis deepens despite minor improvements. Reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment are unlikely.

Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Expansion of interventionist measures, including price controls. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and continue to undermine free competition.
2023-25: Contract rights remain weak, and red tape and ad hoc interventionism continue.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Most attempts to attract investment prove unsuccessful, owing to political and economic instability.
2023-25: Actual investment flows remain low amid ongoing economic volatility. Intellectual property protection and private property rights deteriorate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Currency controls are weakened, but access to foreign currency remains limited.
2023-25: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, and de facto dollarisation advances. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves as oil prices rise, albeit slowly.
Taxes 2021-22: Risk of further unrest and political instability reduces probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major rise in public spending.
2023-25: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2021-22: Inflation remains high and concerns surrounding economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2023-25: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2021-22: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Past emigration of skilled labour aggravates skills shortages.
2023-25: Labour-market rigidities persist, despite some increase in flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Underinvestment in water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts.
2023-25: Investors remain highly cautious about committing to long-term capital projects. Infrastructure deteriorates even further.
Technological readiness 2021-22: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment, but with little interest.
2023-25: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to restrict internet and mobile coverage.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013 proved unsuccessful. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his own popularity plummet as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices, combined with strict sanctions on trade from the US, has plunged the country into a severe economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly (AN). In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature to be in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the AN.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country) has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports, and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$20.9bn in 2018 as the destruction of domestic supply led to increasing import dependence. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates the 2019 current-account surplus at 2.4% of GDP.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), to retain power throughout 2021 despite social and economic shocks. However, the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, diminished oil rents-resulting from US sanctions and low international oil prices-and goods shortages all represent hefty challenges to the survival of the military regime. In addition, social unrest is prevalent and protests could intensify in the coming months owing to severe fuel shortages. Nonetheless, Mr Maduro has a number of factors working in his favour. The regime retains strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces; this control-together with the complexity of the security apparatus and recurrent purges within it-will allow the regime to manage internal dissent.
Another reason to believe that Mr Maduro will retain power is the state of the opposition, led by the head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó. It has lost the momentum that it had in 2019 and lacks consensus on its approach to the forthcoming legislative elections in December. Mr Guaidó's political capital is currently low-a recent poll by Datanálisis (a local pollster) gave him an approval rating of just 17%-and the legislative elections will impair his claim to power. Most opposition forces will boycott the December elections and are likely to seek to extend the current legislative term. However, there is no constitutional basis for an extension, and the PSUV's victory in the forthcoming rigged elections will complicate the opposition's strategy and Mr Guaidó's claim to power, leaving Mr Maduro in a stronger position than a year prior.
Mr Maduro's recent actions illustrate his strong hand relative to the opposition. A new electoral council, inaugurated in June, was packed with Mr Maduro's allies. Even more audaciously, the Supreme Court ejected the leadership of several prominent opposition parties (including Acción Democrática and Voluntad Popular-Mr Guaidó's own party) and replaced them with a group of politicians who claim to be part of the opposition but who are in reality loyal to the regime. The brazenness of these actions shows that Mr Maduro is unperturbed by the prospect of retaliation by the opposition and that political pressure on him is wavering. In a sign that he feels in control of the political environment, he released and/or pardoned more than 100 opposition figures in late August, after talks mediated by Turkey between the regime and Henrique Capriles (a former presidential candidate) and Stalin González (a congressman).
Despite all of this, we recognise that there is a high risk to our forecasts, and that the deteriorating economic situation could prompt some sort of political transition. There are three main paths to a change of government: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We believe that the prospect of military action by the US or Colombia is low, and that a negotiated transition would also be difficult, as trust issues between the two sides are insurmountable. Bearing this in mind, we believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The regime's main weakness is the fragility of its internal finances. Its patronage system is crucial for sustaining its security apparatus and resisting social unrest. Low international crude prices, US sanctions and the dampening effect of a global recession on workers' remittances will shrink US dollar inflows further. The regime will continue to benefit from funds from drug trafficking and illegal mining activities, but a lack of hard currency could prove fatal to the patronage system and will test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks. The regime's liquidity problems-along with a rapidly worsening socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis-could prompt putsch attempts in the near term.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch Legislative elections will take place on December 6th. These elections will be neither free nor fair, and the opposition will lose control of the National Assembly. Most opposition forces plan to boycott the polls, given the lack of electoral guarantees. However, some notable opposition figures-including Mr Capriles and Mr González-have publicly expressed their intention to take part (the opposition parties have boycotted polls in the past, but this only reduced their visibility, influence and legitimacy).
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations Mr Guaidó has marshalled strong support from the international community, but efforts by most governments in Latin America to support him have reached an impasse. Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, the US, has instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions and has openly called for the Venezuelan military to accept Mr Guaidó in place of Mr Maduro. The US will utilise sanctions to put enough pressure on the regime's finances (and therefore on its patronage system) to force Mr Maduro to hold free and fair elections; however, the latter is unlikely to succeed in the medium term. The forthcoming US administration of Joe Biden will remain hawkish in its approach to Venezuela, but we believe that a military intervention is unlikely. We expect most US sanctions to remain in place owing to strong bipartisan support; however, some-such as the recently approved ban on diesel swaps-could be lifted. We also anticipate that diplomatic efforts to reach a negotiated exit for Mr Maduro will increase under a Biden administration.
Iran has recently become Mr Maduro's main international backer. Since April, Iran has sent more than 2.5m barrels of petrol to Venezuela (in exchange for gold shipments) to alleviate the country's severe fuel shortages; more tankers are set to arrive in the coming weeks. Iran is also helping Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA, the Venezuelan state-owned oil company) to repair the Paraguaná oil refinery.
Nevertheless, Russia and China (both strong Venezuelan allies) seem unwilling to provide the financing-amounting to tens of billions of US dollars per year-required to stabilise the economy and secure PDVSA's long-term future. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries but has had little success in securing finance for investment. If a transition from the regime were to come about, we believe that Russia and China would be willing to work with Mr Maduro's successor to protect their current investments.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends The Maduro regime will focus on weathering ongoing fuel shortages that have crippled the economy and on containing the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Despite community spread and an accelerating number of Covid-19 cases, Mr Maduro has eased nationwide quarantine measures to some degree. Measures will remain in place over the short to medium term, as Venezuela's health system is simply unprepared to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. The country's medical infrastructure is poor, and hospitals face significant shortages of water, soap, medicines and electricity.
Given its potential to ignite large-scale protests, Mr Maduro has taken some steps to alleviate fuel scarcity. In May the regime announced a two-tiered petrol distribution system. Drivers are subject to a monthly quota of subsidised petrol. When this has been reached, petrol will be available at internationally indexed prices. The quota system seeks to regularise black-market activity so that the regime (rather than a third party) benefits from the gains. Concurrently, the Maduro regime is seeking to switch on domestic petrol production. PDVSA is currently only able to produce an estimated 20,000 barrels/day (b/d) of petrol (at its peak it could refine 1.3m b/d) and efforts to boost production are often marred by infrastructure breakdowns. However, these actions will only work to an extent, as arbitrage opportunities are still possible under the new subsidy system and domestic petrol production meets only a slim proportion of local demand (about 25% of current demand).
Based on our view that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout our 2021-25 forecast period, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that are required to resolve the economic crisis. De facto dollarisation is expanding; although this was not a tacit goal for the regime, Mr Maduro now welcomes it. Other under-the-radar adjustments are possible in the coming years, as long as these benefit the regime's survival. Such efforts alone are unlikely to bring about economic stability, owing to the absence of comprehensive microeconomic reform or improvements in the rule of law, and policy predictability will not be forthcoming under the current regime.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy The authorities have not published complete data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect the non-financial public-sector deficit to narrow in 2021, and the public debt/GDP ratio to remain high in the coming years. The sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will curb government spending. The regime relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Money printing will continue to finance the government's deficits in 2021-25. However, in the medium term, growing remittance inflows will somewhat offset the need to monetise budget deficits. We currently assume no debt restructuring in 2021-25. Venezuela's weak fiscal position is complicated by the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing-mainly PDVSA-issued debt and development funds from China-that understates the true size of total public liabilities.
All of the sovereign's outstanding global bonds are in arrears. Indeed, a US court has ruled that PDVSA is an "alter ego" of the Venezuelan government; this will have far-reaching implications, as some international firms are seeking to seize shares of Citgo stock. The key PDVSA 2020 bond, which was secured using 50.1% of the shares of Citgo (PDVSA's US subsidiary) as collateral, fell due at end-October 2019 and was not paid. Bondholders of the PDVSA 2020 are currently unable to seek to attach assets owing to an ongoing suspension by the US Treasury. Nevertheless, there is a strong possibility that the Venezuelan opposition, which currently holds Citgo, will lose control of it to bondholders in early 2021.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy The government's financing needs will force the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) to ramp up money printing in the short term. Growing dollarisation and a strong contraction in domestic demand slowed hyperinflationary pressures in 2019-20. This trend will continue in 2021, but hyperinflationary pressures will remain significant owing to the monetisation of large fiscal deficits and severe goods shortages. Hyperinflation will continue until its underlying causes are addressed. It has quickened the pace of dollar-isation of the economy (more than 60% of transactions are now thought to be conducted in US dollars). We believe that Venezuela is heading towards overall de facto dollarisation. Monthly inflation will rise again in the short term and will remain substantial.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 30.3% in 2020 (and a cumulative contraction of almost 77% since 2013), we forecast an additional 1.7% decline in GDP in 2021. GDP is now strongly correlated with oil output and export. Following plummeting oil exports in 2019-20, crude production will stabilise as global energy demand starts to recover. Concurrently, the non-oil economy will benefit from the lifting of social distancing measures in 2021 and from larger fuel supplies (even though domestic petrol production will not fully cover local demand). From a demand-side perspective, the GDP contraction will be driven by falling real incomes, hyperinflation and continued mass emigration (fuelled by unemployment, violence and social instability). Low crude prices and weak oil exports will continue to threaten crude production. Venezuela's average break-even price is about US$15-20/barrel. US sanctions on the regime raise the risks involved in dealing with Venezuela, forcing the country to offer a hefty discount on its crude. This means that, at current market prices, Venezuela is making only a limited profit (its oil basket traded at an estimated US$25/b as at end-October). The current circumstances have inevitably led to production cuts; according to OPEC, oil output fell to 350,000 b/d in October 2020, from 700,000 b/d in October 2019 and 1.3m b/d a year earlier. We believe that average output will remain below 400,000 b/d over the coming months.
In 2022 we expect economic growth to return on the back of a surge in oil prices. Despite serious operational problems (such as difficulties in obtaining equipment for repairs or finding qualified staff) and a limited pool of suitable buyers of Venezuelan crude, oil output will recover partly in the medium term as producers adapt to post-sanctions export markets. Furthermore, relative macroeconomic stability will allow the non-oil economy to recover marginally in the medium term. Nonetheless, we assume that Venezuela's GDP (in real terms) will be only about half of its 2018 level, even in 2025. There are substantial risks to our forecasts, which assume that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout 2021-25.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation A severely reduced domestic goods supply, constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits will continue to stoke hyperinflation in 2021. Social distancing measures, dollarisation and heavy credit restrictions imposed by the regime have helped to subdue inflation this year, keeping it at bay. Consumer prices rose by 23.8% month on month in October; however, inflationary pressures will strengthen in the short term, owing to fuel scarcity, price controls, the ramping-up of money printing by the government and the latest minimum wage increment. In early November the Maduro regime trebled the monthly minimum wage-to which wages of a sizeable share of the labour force are directly or indirectly linked-to BsS1.2m (US$1.90).
In the medium term, inflation will remain high for as long as the Maduro regime is in power, given huge fundamental imbalances between supply and demand, and the need for the regime to monetise its fiscal deficits. Weather-related shocks are a perennial risk to the inflation outlook. However, dollarisation will tame hyperinflationary pressures, and inflationary pressures will ease gradually over the coming years.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates Hyperinflation will sustain bolívar depreciation in 2021. Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency denomination (as in March 2018) or a new currency is a strong possibility, although the exact nature of such a move is hard to forecast. In mid-2019 the regime announced a loosening of currency controls. Although this was a positive move, significant barriers limit access to US dollars via formal means. We still believe that the government will maintain a number of indirect controls on the foreign-exchange market. In this environment, a black-market exchange-rate premium is inevitable. On November 13th the official exchange rate was BsS645,000:US$1 (against a black-market rate of BsS690,000:US$1). The current premium (7%) is small by historical comparison.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector Venezuela will post a small current-account deficit of 1% of GDP in 2021, owing to weak oil exports and limited remittance inflows resulting from the global recession. Official BCV figures for 2017-18 show that Venezuela posted current-account surpluses in this period. In 2019-20 the collapse of goods export earnings (owing to US sanctions on the oil trade) hit the trade balance hard. Nevertheless, based on the latest data, we estimate that the export collapse was mostly covered by growing inflows of workers' remittances and the non-payment of interest on bonded debt (saving in excess of US$5bn in 2019).
We expect the current account to return to surplus in the medium term, averaging 4.4% of GDP in 2022-25. Goods exports will recover as international oil prices increase and the country steps up trade with Asian markets. The recovery in the current account will be supported by continued weakness in domestic demand, rising remittances from abroad and the fact that the sovereign will remain in default throughout the forecast period.

Abstract: [...]its global and regional rankings fall. [...]the non-oil sector is be largely shielded from external competition. 2023-25: A new government (which is likely to be opposition-led) is likely to remain wary of opening up the economy. Movement of goods is highly regulated to prevent smuggling, but people will be allowed to cross land borders once the coronavirus pandemic is brought under control. 2023-25: A spread between the official and the parallel-market exchange rates persists as oil prices rise and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is again able to defend an overvalued official exchange rate.

Full text: - The tenure of the president, Muhammadu Buhari, will last until 2023 and be blemished by a decline in living standards caused by recession in 2020, a rise in unemployment and (paradoxically) high, policy-induced inflation.
- The administration will struggle to tackle high levels of poverty and the country's ethnic and religious divisions. This potent mixture has the potential to cause mass protests and will halt the advancement of pro-market reforms.
- A decline in living standards under Mr Buhari, whose tenure has been marked by two recessions, as well as frustrations over pervasive insecurity and poor governance means that the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) is forecast to win the 2023 election.
- The Economist Intelligence Unit expects some reregulation of electricity pricing under a PDP government. Although this would be bad news for the power sector, we do not expect a return to distortive pricing in the petroleum sector.
- Low world oil prices will continue to exert pressure on the multiple-exchange-rate regime and, in 2021, force another devaluation of the official rate. Foreign-exchange supply is then expected to improve, allowing the market to stabilise in 2022-25.
- Low oil prices in 2021 will coincide with large recurrent government spending commitments and result in another substantial fiscal deficit, by Nigerian standards. The budget shortfall will then broadly edge down as external conditions improve, the domestic economy picks up and revenue rises.
- Given a crippling infrastructure deficit, high inflation, instability in crucial agricultural regions and high unemployment, we expect growth of just 1.1% in 2021. Only when the exchange rate and inflation stabilise will there be a more meaningful recovery.
- Inflation will stay high in 2021 as devaluation of the naira, price deregulation, instability in agricultural growing areas, monetary loosening and exchange-rate restrictions for staple imports feed into consumer prices. Monetary tightening is expected to start from 2022 to tackle the issue.
- We expect a current-account deficit for a third consecutive year in 2021 (something that has not been seen since the 1990s) despite a modest increase in oil prices. The current account will return to surplus in 2022-25 as the oil market recovers and petrol import volumes decline.

- Nigeria's business environment score worsens slightly for the forecast period (2021-25) as the macroeconomic and security environment remains highly challenging. As a result, its global and regional rankings fall.

Country forecast overview: Nigeria's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: The overarching policy objective is to promote self-sufficiency and local industrialisation through protectionism. As a result, the non-oil sector is be largely shielded from external competition.
2023-25: A new government (which is likely to be opposition-led) is likely to remain wary of opening up the economy.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: A reduction is made to royalties for offshore oil activity introduced in 2020 in an attempt to prevent divestment from oil majors operating in Nigeria. Outside the oil sector, concerns over the foreign-exchange regime deter investment.
2023-25: Energy firms remain hesitant about increasing their presence in a difficult operating environment, especially onshore, but concerted efforts are made to clean up the national oil company (which is in joint venture with oil majors).
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Movement of goods is highly regulated to prevent smuggling, but people will be allowed to cross land borders once the coronavirus pandemic is brought under control.
2023-25: A spread between the official and the parallel-market exchange rates persists as oil prices rise and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is again able to defend an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxes 2021-22: The focus on boosting tax compliance intensifies, but the weak state of the economy and upcoming elections prevent tax increases.
2023-25: Value-added tax (VAT) is raised from 7.5% to cut the budget deficit amid persistently high debt-servicing costs.
Financing 2021-22: The government returns to the sovereign debt market, and capital projects are restarted.
2023-25: Credit conditions become tighter as the CBN moves to control high inflation.
The labour market 2021-22: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers, restrictive visa regulations and poor health indicators.
2023-25: Employers continue to struggle to find qualified staff; unemployment stays high and the labour market loose.
Infrastructure 2021-22: A reduction in consumer subsidies (for petrol) frees up resources for higher public capital investment, but government spending remains small relative to the size of the economy, at under 7%.
2023-25: A large private refinery starts up, reducing Nigeria's near-total dependency on imported petrol.
Technological readiness 2021-22: Nigeria retains a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2023-25: Research spending remains low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960, and multi-party democracy was restored in 1999 after a protracted period of military rule. The first two presidential elections (in 1999 and 2003) were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. In 2015 Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari, who secured a second term in early 2019.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties predominate. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the predominant political force, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015 and secure re-election in 2019.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. The government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is a contentious issue, with important subsidy programmes hinging on an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take small as a share of GDP. With oil prices far lower than they were in 2010-14, it is likely that amendments to consumer taxes will be made, specifically in value-added tax (VAT, currently 7.5%).
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the president, Muhammadu Buhari, to stay in power until his second (and final) term expires in 2023. He will be under immense pressure to stabilise Nigeria, but myriad security threats will prove unmanageable. The military and police are overstretched and unable to tackle simultaneous security crises. Emergencies will be triaged, with military resources deployed to whichever is considered the most pressing.
This shaky system will keep the government in power but leave the country highly dysfunctional and, in many regions, extremely insecure. Protests against police brutality in October morphed into an expression of wider political and economic malaise, which proved capable of galvanising mass action. Mr Buhari was able to appease the central demand of the campaign by disbanding a particular police unit and promising security reform. Conciliation would be harder to repeat should a fresh, co-ordinated movement harness the other grievances that the protests tapped into, including unemployment, poor governance and a general decline in living standards. High inflation, partly resulting from petrol and electricity price deregulation, stands to be a particular driver of renewed unrest in 2021, with a strong risk of organised mass protests in normally stable cities such as the commercial capital, Lagos, and the administrative capital, Abuja. Government buildings but also private enterprise could be targeted by a violent minority, as was the case in recent unrest. Should protests grow in size, they would probably push Mr Buhari's administration to make policy compromises. The president's commitment to pro-market reforms is already judged to have wilted following recent protests, and a planned electricity tariff increase has been already softened.
Besides dealing with economic crisis, the government will remain embroiled in a conflict with Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), Islamist terrorist groups that are causing havoc in north-eastern Nigeria. As the region is a stronghold of the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), the president will be committed to asserting control, irrespective of how difficult this will be. Boko Haram and ISWAP will be aggressively countered, but the north-east-particularly Borno state-will remain a low-level conflict zone, and the campaign there will divert security forces away from other insecure parts of Nigeria.
One hotspot that is likely to remain insecure and neglected is the agricultural Middle Belt, where violent conflict between farmers and herdsmen over increasingly scarce land and water resources has killed thousands in recent years. Formal land-titling is a potential solution to the crisis; however, as it would in effect alienate one group from communal holdings in favour of another, it would prove too contentious. As with the north-east, the direct effects of the conflict will be localised, but the entire country will feel the fallout in the form of reduced local food production and high prices.
The military and police will be too poorly equipped to suppress pervasive banditry and kidnapping, particularly in the north-west. Widespread poverty and unemployment are feeding a cycle of crime that will be difficult (if not impossible) to break, given a bleak economic outlook for 2021 at least.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch The next national elections are due in 2023. In the most recent presidential election, in 2019, the candidates of both main parties were from the north, and custom dictates that the candidates in 2023 will be from the south. This should lead to an improvement on the abysmally low turnout in 2019 in the south, which is a stronghold of the main opposition party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP). Frustration with high prices, declining living standards and perpetual instability will be directed at the APC, giving the PDP a winning edge.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations Nigeria will remain a major player in Sub-Saharan Africa given its size, but its domestic challenges tend to keep policymakers inwardly focused. Exasperation over smuggling, which policymakers view as undermining local industry, led the government to close all of Nigeria's land borders to goods traffic in late 2019. Given rising local prices in Nigeria for agricultural goods (and so declining international competitiveness), there will be no rush to reopen the borders to regional trade in 2021, and potentially for longer. Protectionism (underpinned by foreign-exchange restrictions) also makes Nigeria's adoption of a common West African currency, the eco, highly unlikely.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends As part of its response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the government has sought about US$6.9bn (about 2% of GDP) from multilateral lenders to finance a US$1.4bn healthcare fund, a public works programme and support for businesses. Not all the loans are low-conditionality, encouraging Mr Buhari to enact the boldest economic reforms since his coming to office. A cap on pump prices has been removed, allowing petrol prices to rise to record levels (for Nigeria) in September. Ending petrol price caps is essential for freeing up fiscal space, and new refineries that are either being built or at the planning stage (including a 650,000-barrel/day facility currently under construction) will require pricing to be suitable for supply to the domestic market. Electricity tariffs are also being raised for usage exceeding 12 hours a day. Attaining cost-reflective electricity tariffs is crucial for alleviating the burden of bad debts that have been run up along the power supply chain, which have hindered investment and resulted in regular outages.
However, political pressures mean the government may well fail to keep prices liberal on a permanent basis. Negotiations with the World Bank, which has demanded such reforms as a precondition for a possible US$3bn financial package, have dragged on well beyond official expectations. As the brunt of the coronavirus crisis has probably passed for Nigeria we no longer expect a finance package with the World Bank to be achieved. The government will prefer policy independence and instead issue debt internationally in 2021 (market perception of credit risk has been in decline, as judged by default swap spreads). Recent protests in southern Nigeria are partially a product of price reforms, fitting into a wider exasperation over declining living standards, and political pressure has already prompted a scaling down of electricity price increases. Reinstatement of price controls for petrol is made less likely by a new Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), which has a good chance of passing through parliament. The legislation would scrap the current price regulator in the process of creating a new, profit-oriented national oil company. The PIB will encourage upstream oil investment by making fiscal terms clearer for multinationals. The downstream industry should also become commercially viable from this reorganisation of the sector, allowing Nigeria to wean itself off petrol imports as new refinery capacity comes on stream (which we expect to happen by 2022). However, it is relatively easier to keep electricity tariffs regulated. We do not expect sustained price increases-which would be needed to make the sector financially sound-and the power sector is therefore expected to remain dysfunctional, with electricity undersupply continuing to hinder industry.
Management of the naira is another sticking point for the World Bank. Low foreign-exchange inflows-reflecting low global oil prices-has provided scope for unifying the overvalued official exchange rate and the more market-determined Nigerian autonomous foreign-exchange fixing (NAFEX) rate, raising local-currency fiscal receipts from sales of crude oil. Once foreign-exchange availability improves and the current account returns to surplus, however, which we expect in 2022, the official rate is likely to again be quoted at a discount to the NAFEX. The idea of a single market rate has been proposed before (most recently in 2016) only to be jettisoned once foreign reserves increased, and the government only plans to manage the exchange-rate regime "sustainably" in the long run. An overvalued official exchange rate allows sectors deemed economically important, namely agriculture and manufacturing, to be subsidised, and fits an agenda of job creation and self-sufficiency through protectionism. A ban on accessing foreign exchange to purchase various imports (currently covering 45 items) is another arm of this strategy. From an investor perspective, the exchange-rate regime and its convertibility restrictions pose a threat of capital controls, which were temporarily imposed in 2016. We expect the long-term impact of the currency regime on investor confidence to keep foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows below 1% of GDP throughout the 2021-25 forecast period (and mostly in the hydrocarbons sector).
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy We expect the fiscal balance to stay in deficit in 2021-25. Crude oil receipts comprise more than 50% of the federal government's retained income, indicating a continued revenue crunch as oil prices stay low in 2021. High debt-servicing costs, pressing security needs and personnel outlays related to overstaffing will elevate expenditure throughout the forecast period. Widespread tax avoidance and low oil prices compared with the 2010-14 super-cycle will keep federally retained revenue below 4% of GDP throughout 2021-25.
Capital expenditure for the purposes of stimulus will be emphasised in 2021 now that subsidies (which are taken from revenue) have been reduced. This increase in fixed investment will be relatively small, but given low oil prices and so fiscal receipts, we expect a deficit equivalent to 3.1% of GDP. Higher oil prices will stabilise the deficit in 2022, despite a pre-election increase in spending, particularly on security. With a probable rise in value-added tax (VAT) rates (to curb a hazardously high debt-revenue ratio) after the 2023 elections, and oil prices continuing to rise, the deficit will shrink to 2.9% of GDP in 2023 and 2.7% in 2024, before widening to 3% of GDP in 2025 as oil prices fall.
As interest rates are currently low for the sovereign, domestic debt will be more attractive in the near-to-medium term. The government also wants to secure multilateral loans, but as these fall short of the officially expected quantum, we expect the government to return to the international capital market from 2021.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will fail to prevent inflation from exceeding its target ceiling of 9% over much of the forecast period, and its policy decisions are likely to be erratic. In the context of a probable recession and limited fiscal firepower, it decided to cut the policy rate by 100 basis points to 11.5% in September (after an 100-basis-point cut in May), despite an upward trend in annual inflation, to 13.2% in August. The strategy is to boost the supply side of the real economy to bring inflation back under control. In our view this is misguided; high and rising inflation will frustrate an economic recovery, and issues such as inadequate public infrastructure and rampant instability need to be addressed before sectors with high potential for returns (such as agriculture) can make full use of cheaper capital. Because we do not expect the supply-side improvements to bring inflation down, the CBN will have to raise interest rates once the economic crisis passes. We expect this to happen in 2022, with easing resuming only in 2024 when inflation has fallen appreciably.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth The economy is expected to exit recession in 2021 as the impact of lockdown in 2020 fades, but high inflation will impede improvement in business sentiment and dampen real purchasing power amid low productivity, underemployment and low nominal wage growth. Fiscal stimulus will be an inadequate counterforce, given budget constraints, and loose monetary policy (despite high inflation) will contribute to exchange-rate pressures and further undermine macroeconomic stability. Oil production will, however, rise slightly as quotas agreed by OPEC+ (comprising OPEC and a group of non-OPEC countries) are relaxed, and given an uptick in oil exports we expect growth of 1.1% in 2021.
The CBN is expected to tighten monetary policy from 2022, which will circumscribe the nascent economic recovery, but the exchange rate will stabilise and inflation ease. As non-business financial penetration is low, private consumption will recover alongside disinflation even as interest rates rise. OPEC+ quotas will be raised from April that year and new refining capacity is expected to come on stream in earnest, boosting real exports (with some output for the regional market) and reducing imports. Consequently, we expect growth of 3.1% in 2022. As refinery output continues to ramp up, crude oil exports rise, inflation falls and real incomes rise, growth will pick up to an annual average of 3.8% in 2023-24. However, these rates of growth are well below potential. The economy will continue to lack dynamism owing to high interest rates, low FDI, high unemployment, pervasive instability in agricultural regions and infrastructure deficiencies, particularly regarding stable power supply. A more challenging year is forecast for 2025 as oil prices fall sharply and macroeconomic uncertainty rises, with growth slipping back to 1.6%.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation Looser monetary policy (which will lead to currency adjustments), combined with higher fuel and electricity tariffs, foreign-exchange restrictions on various imported goods-including staple foods-and devaluation of the naira will raise inflation to an average of 16% in 2021. Assuming that oil prices rise, stabilising the exchange rate, and the CBN eventually reverses monetary easing, we expect the annual rate to fall throughout 2022-25, to 8.5% at end-2025. Conflict and agricultural supply disruptions in the Middle Belt-Nigeria's breadbasket-as well as foreign-exchange controls on imported goods will prevent a faster fall.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates An illusion of stability in the naira has recently held; the CBN is supplying foreign exchange to regulated trading windows but only fitfully, and a large unmet order-book for foreign exchange from exporters and investors has prevented a drawdown of foreign reserves. Assuming that oil prices stay low in 2021 and with low domestic interest rates sustaining capital outflow pressures, we expect a devaluation of the official rate that year (following two adjustments in 2020). This will take the naira from N379:US$1 at end-2020 to N450:US$1 at end-2021. The official and NAFEX rates will be broadly unified in the process. For the remainder of the forecast period the official exchange rate to the US dollar is expected to be kept relatively stable. Monetary tightening in Nigeria will encourage hot money inflows, higher oil prices will boost foreign exchange inflows (and lessen concerns over capital controls), and the current account is also forecast to return to surplus. Divergence between official and NAFEX rates is likely to re-emerge, but the CBN should be able to supply adequate foreign-exchange liquidity to regulated trading windows, broadly stabilising the market even as world oil prices (and so net foreign-exchange inflows) fluctuate.
Forecasting the naira Although The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts both the official and the secondary market rates, it is the official rate that appears in most of its data presentations, as this is the longest-running and best-tracked variable. The official rate also best represents exchange-rate policy. Indicators that are converted into US dollars at the official rate are essentially overvalued, which is in line with official calculations.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector An export slump due to low world oil prices and OPEC+ production quotas will keep the current account in deficit in 2021, for a third consecutive year (a stretch unseen since the early 1990s), with a shortfall of 2% of GDP expected. This is despite a slight uptick in imports of goods and services as the economy recovers and coronavirus-related travel restrictions imposed in 2020 are lifted, with a devalued naira restraining the increase. Over the remainder of the forecast period a current-account surplus is expected. Oil prices are projected to rise in 2022-23, which will expand exports, while lower petroleum import volumes as new domestic refinery capacity comes on stream will constrain the import bill. Remittances from the large Nigerian diaspora should also increase as the coronavirus crisis passes globally. This will all contribute to an annual average current-account surplus of 1.1% of GDP in 2022-24. The surplus will then ebb to 0.8% of GDP in 2025 as falling oil prices push down export earnings and continued real effective exchange-rate appreciation and monetary easing cause imports to continue to rise. The deficit in 2021 will be financed largely by debt inflows, with loose monetary policy discouraging portfolio investment.

Full text: - Despite Venezuela's socioeconomic collapse and the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the civic-military regime led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela to retain power throughout the 2021-25 forecast period. Mr Maduro's position will be supported primarily by his grip over a complex security apparatus and the opposition's lack of de facto power. On this basis, we expect continued deterioration of the economy, sustained outward migration, and a poorer and more violent Venezuela. Despite US sanctions (and their impact on oil production), the Maduro regime has managed internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through its strict control over the security forces.
- The scale of the socioeconomic collapse and the elevated level of political instability will ensure that the Maduro regime continues to be challenged both economically and politically. Low international crude prices, combined with US sanctions on the regime, mean that Venezuela is struggling to place its oil exports abroad. We therefore forecast that domestic crude production will average less than 400,000 barrels/day in the coming months. Mr Maduro will continue to face challenges to maintain the current patronage system and remain in control. That said, his position will strengthen in 2021, as the opposition is set to lose control of the legislature in January following a rigged legislative election on December 6th 2020.
- De facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding. Concurrently, the government has taken measures that have allowed the official exchange rate to float. These measures have so far aided price stability and therefore increase the availability of some basic goods. However, the measures are not a product of economic orthodoxy, but of policy decisions to ensure the regime's survival. We do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that will be required to resolve the economic crisis within the forecast period.

- Venezuela is ranked 82nd of 82 countries in the global business environ-ment rankings for 2021-25, having been in 80th place in the 2016-20 historical period, as the economic crisis deepens despite minor improvements. Reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment are unlikely.

Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Expansion of interventionist measures, including price controls. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and continue to undermine free competition.
2023-25: Contract rights remain weak, and red tape and ad hoc interventionism continue.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Most attempts to attract investment prove unsuccessful, owing to political and economic instability.
2023-25: Actual investment flows remain low amid ongoing economic volatility. Intellectual property protection and private property rights deteriorate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Currency controls are weakened, but access to foreign currency remains limited.
2023-25: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, and de facto dollarisation advances. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves as oil prices rise, albeit slowly.
Taxes 2021-22: Risk of further unrest and political instability reduces probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major rise in public spending.
2023-25: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2021-22: Inflation remains high and concerns surrounding economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2023-25: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2021-22: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Past emigration of skilled labour aggravates skills shortages.
2023-25: Labour-market rigidities persist, despite some increase in flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Underinvestment in water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts.
2023-25: Investors remain highly cautious about committing to long-term capital projects. Infrastructure deteriorates even further.
Technological readiness 2021-22: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment, but with little interest.
2023-25: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to restrict internet and mobile coverage.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013 proved unsuccessful. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his own popularity plummet as his mismanagement of a drop in oil prices, combined with strict sanctions on trade from the US, has plunged the country into a severe economic depression.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly (AN). In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature to be in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly has granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the AN.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA, the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country) has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports, and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$20.9bn in 2018 as the destruction of domestic supply led to increasing import dependence. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates the 2019 current-account surplus at 1.2% of GDP.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), to retain power throughout 2021 despite social and economic shocks. However, the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, diminished oil rents-resulting from US sanctions and low international oil prices-and goods shortages all represent hefty challenges to the survival of the military regime. In addition, social unrest is prevalent and protests could intensify in the coming months owing to severe fuel shortages. Nonetheless, Mr Maduro has a number of factors working in his favour. The regime retains strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces; this control-together with the complexity of the security apparatus and recurrent purges within it-will allow the regime to manage internal dissent.
Another reason to believe that Mr Maduro will retain power is the state of the opposition, led by the head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó. It has lost the momentum that it had in 2019 and lacks consensus on its approach to the upcoming legislative elections in December. Mr Guaidó's political capital is currently low-a recent poll by Datanálisis (a local pollster) gave him an approval rating of just 17%-and the legislative elections will impair his claim to power. Most opposition forces will boycott the December elections and are likely to seek to extend the current legislative term. However, there is no constitutional basis for an extension, and the PSUV's victory in the upcoming rigged elections will complicate the opposition's strategy and Mr Guaidó's claim to power, leaving Mr Maduro in a stronger position than a year prior.
Mr Maduro's recent actions illustrate his strong hand relative to the opposition. A new electoral council, inaugurated in June, was packed with Mr Maduro's allies. Even more audaciously, the Supreme Court ejected the leadership of several prominent opposition parties (including Acción Democrática and Voluntad Popular-Mr Guaidó's own party) and replaced them with a group of politicians who claim to be part of the opposition but who are in reality loyal to the regime. The brazenness of these actions shows that Mr Maduro is unperturbed by the prospect of retaliation by the opposition and that political pressure on him is wavering. In a sign that he feels in control of the political environment, he released and/or pardoned more than 100 opposition figures in late August, after talks mediated by Turkey between the regime and Henrique Capriles (a former presidential candidate) and Stalin González (a congressman).
Despite all of this, we recognise that there is a high risk to our forecasts, and that the deteriorating economic situation could prompt some sort of political transition. There are three main paths to a change of government: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We believe that the prospect of military action by the US or Colombia is low, and that a negotiated transition would also be difficult, as trust issues between the two sides are insurmountable. Bearing this in mind, we believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The regime's main weakness is the fragility of its internal finances. Its patronage system is crucial for sustaining its security apparatus and resisting social unrest. Low international crude prices, US sanctions and the dampening effect of a global recession on workers' remittances will shrink US dollar inflows further. The regime will continue to benefit from funds from drug trafficking and illegal mining activities, but a lack of hard currency could prove fatal to the patronage system and will test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks. The regime's liquidity problems-along with a rapidly worsening socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis-could prompt putsch attempts in the near term.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch Legislative elections will take place on December 6th. These elections will be neither free nor fair, and the opposition will lose control of the National Assembly. Most opposition forces plan to boycott the polls, given the lack of electoral guarantees. However, some notable opposition figures-including Mr Capriles and Mr González-have publicly expressed their intention to take part (the opposition parties have boycotted polls in the past, but this only reduced their visibility, influence and legitimacy).
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations Mr Guaidó has marshalled strong support from the international community, but efforts by most governments in Latin America to support him have reached an impasse. Mr Guaidó's most committed champion, the US, has instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions and has openly called for the Venezuelan military to accept Mr Guaidó in place of Mr Maduro. The US expects sanctions to put enough pressure on the regime's finances (and therefore on its patronage system) to force Mr Maduro to hold free and fair elections. The US also warned of additional sanctions in the near future; for example, it plans to impose sanctions on diesel imports before end-October. The US administration will remain hawkish in its approach to foreign policy, but we believe that a military intervention is unlikely, given the aversion of the US president, Donald Trump, to such adventurism. Nonetheless, we expect the US to further intensify diplomatic pressure before the next US general election and the next Venezuelan legislative elections, which are set to take place in November and December respectively. If tensions rise and political violence increases, the possibility of smaller-scale interventions cannot be discounted. Looking ahead, regardless of whether Mr Trump or his opponent, Joe Biden of the Democratic Party, wins the US election (our baseline forecast is for a Biden victory), we expect US sanctions to remain in place owing to strong bipartisan support. We anticipate that efforts to reach a negotiated exit for Mr Maduro would increase under a Biden administration.
Iran has recently become Mr Maduro's main international backer. Between April and June Iran sent 1.5m barrels of petrol to Venezuela (in exchange for gold shipments) to alleviate the country's severe fuel shortages; more tankers are set to arrive in the coming weeks. Iran is also helping Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA, the Venezuelan state-owned oil company) to repair the Paraguaná oil refinery. Nevertheless, Russia and China (both strong Venezuelan allies) seem unwilling to provide the financing-amounting to tens of billions of US dollars per year-required to stabilise the economy and secure PDVSA's long-term future. Mr Maduro has openly courted the two countries but has had little success in securing finance for investment. If a transition from the regime were to come about, we believe that Russia and China would be willing to work with Mr Maduro's successor to protect their current investments.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends The Maduro regime will focus on weathering ongoing fuel shortages that have crippled the economy and on containing the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Despite community spread and an accelerating number of Covid-19 cases, Mr Maduro has eased nationwide quarantine measures to some degree. Measures will remain in place over the short to medium term, as Venezuela's health system is simply unprepared to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. The country's medical infrastructure is poor, and hospitals face significant shortages of water, soap, medicines and electricity.
Given its potential to ignite large-scale protests, Mr Maduro has taken some steps to alleviate fuel scarcity. In May the regime announced a two-tiered petrol distribution system. Drivers are subject to a monthly quota of subsidised petrol. When this has been reached, petrol will be available at internationally indexed prices. The quota system seeks to regularise black-market activity so that the regime (rather than a third party) benefits from the gains. Concurrently, the Maduro regime is seeking to switch on domestic petrol production. PDVSA is currently able to produce only an estimated 20,000 barrels/day of petrol (at its peak it could refine 1.3m b/d) and repair existing refineries (although efforts to boost production are often marred by infrastructure breakdowns). However, these actions will only work to an extent, as arbitrage opportunities are still possible under the new subsidy system and domestic petrol production meets only a slim proportion of local demand (about 25% of current demand).
Based on our view that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout our 2021-25 forecast period, we do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that are required to resolve the economic crisis. De facto dollarisation is expanding; although this was not a tacit goal for the regime, Mr Maduro now welcomes it. Other under-the-radar adjustments are possible in the coming years, as long as these benefit the regime's survival. Such efforts alone are unlikely to bring about economic stability, owing to the absence of comprehensive microeconomic reform or improvements in the rule of law, and policy predictability will not be forthcoming under the current regime.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy The authorities have not published complete data on fiscal accounts since 2011. We expect the non-financial public-sector deficit to narrow in 2021, and the public debt/GDP ratio to remain high in the coming years. The sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will curb govern-ment spending. The regime relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Money printing will continue to finance the government's deficits in 2021-25. However, in the medium term, growing remittance inflows will partly offset the need to monetise budget deficits. We currently assume no debt restructuring in 2021-25. Venezuela's weak fiscal position is complicated by the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing-mainly PDVSA-issued debt and development funds from China-that understates the true size of total public liabilities.
All of the sovereign's outstanding global bonds are in arrears. Indeed, a US court has ruled that PDVSA is an "alter ego" of the Venezuelan government; this will have far-reaching implications, as some international firms are seeking to seize shares of Citgo stock. The key PDVSA 2020 bond, which was secured using 50.1% of the shares of Citgo (PDVSA's US subsidiary) as collateral, fell due at end-October 2019 and was not paid. Bondholders of the PDVSA 2020 are currently unable to seek to attach assets owing to an ongoing suspension by the US Treasury. Nevertheless, there is a strong possibility that the Venezuelan opposition, which currently holds Citgo, will lose control of it to bondholders in early 2021.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy The government's financing needs will force the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) to ramp up money printing in the short term. Growing dollarisation and a strong contraction in domestic demand slowed hyper-inflationary pressures in 2019, a trend that has continued in 2020. However, we expect that hyperinflationary pressures will build again in 2021, owing to the monetisation of large fiscal deficits and severe goods shortages.
Hyperinflation will continue until its underlying causes are addressed. Hyperinflation has quickened the pace of dollarisation of the economy (more than 60% of transactions are now thought to be conducted in US dollars). We believe that Venezuela is heading towards overall de facto dollarisation. Monthly inflation will rise again in the short term and will remain substantial.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 30.3% in 2020 (and a cumulative contraction of almost 77% since 2013), we forecast an additional 1.7% decline in GDP in 2021. GDP is now strongly correlated with oil output and export. Following plummeting oil exports in 2019-20, crude production will stabilise as global energy demand starts to recover. Concurrently, the non-oil economy will benefit from the lifting of social distancing measures in 2021 and from larger fuel supplies (even though domestic petrol production will not fully cover local demand). From a demand-side perspective, the GDP contraction will be driven by falling real incomes, hyperinflation and continued mass emigration (fuelled by unemployment, violence and social instability).
Low crude prices and weak oil exports will still continue to threaten crude production. Venezuela's average break-even price is about US$15-20/barrel. US sanctions on the regime raise the risks involved in dealing with Venezuela, forcing the country to offer a hefty discount on its crude. This means that, at current market prices, Venezuela is making only a limited profit (its oil basket traded at an estimated US$25/b as at end-August). The current circumstances have inevitably led to production cuts; according to OPEC, oil output fell to 340,000 b/d in August 2020, from 800,000 b/d in August 2019 and 1.3m b/d a year earlier. We believe that average output will remain below 400,000 b/d over the coming months.
In 2022 we expect economic growth to return on the back of a surge in oil prices. Despite serious operational problems (such as difficulties in obtaining equipment for repairs or finding qualified staff) and a limited pool of suitable buyers of Venezuelan crude, oil output will recover partially in the medium term as producers adapt to post-sanctions export markets. Furthermore, relative macroeconomic stability will allow the non-oil economy to recover marginally in the medium term. Nonetheless, we assume that Venezuela's GDP (in real terms) will be only about half of its 2018 level, even in 2025. There are substantial risks to our forecasts, which assume that Mr Maduro will retain power throughout 2021-25.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation A severely reduced domestic goods supply, constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits will continue to stoke hyperinflation in 2021. Social distancing measures, dollarisation and heavy credit restrictions imposed by the regime have helped to subdue inflation this year, keeping it at bay. Consumer prices rose by 25% month on month in August; however, as the economy reopens, inflationary pressures will grow, owing to fuel scarcity, price controls and the ramping-up of money printing by the government.
In the medium term, inflation will remain high for as long as the Maduro regime is in power, given huge fundamental imbalances between supply and demand, and the need for the regime to monetise its fiscal deficits. Weather-related shocks are a perennial risk to the inflation outlook. However, dollarisation will tame hyperinflationary pressures.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates Hyperinflation will sustain bolívar depreciation in 2021. Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency denomination (as in March 2018) or a new currency is a strong possibility, although the exact nature of such a move is hard to forecast. In mid-2019 the regime announced a loosening of currency controls. Although this was a positive move, significant barriers limit access to US dollars via formal means. We still believe that the government will maintain a number of indirect controls on the foreign-exchange market. In this environment, a black-market exchange-rate premium is inevitable. On September 22nd the official exchange rate was BsS386,000:US$1 (against a black-market rate of BsS411,000:US$1). The current premium (6%) is small by historical comparison.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector Venezuela will post a small current-account deficit of 0.8% of GDP in 2021, owing to weak oil exports and limited remittance inflows resulting from the global recession. Official BCV figures for 2017-18 show that Venezuela posted current-account surpluses in this period. In 2019-20 the collapse of goods export earnings (due to US sanctions on the oil trade) hit the trade balance hard. Nevertheless, based on the latest data, we estimate that the export collapse was mostly covered by growing inflows of workers' remittances and the non-payment of interest on bonded debt (saving in excess of US$5bn in 2019).
We expect the current account to return to surplus in the medium term, averaging 3.6% of GDP in 2022-25. Goods exports will recover as international oil prices increase and the country steps up trade with Asian markets. The recovery in the current account will be supported by continued weakness in domestic demand, rising remittances from abroad and the fact that the sovereign will remain in default throughout the forecast period.
