Full text: - The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, to complete a first term in 2024 and run for a second term, but a week of serious civil disorder in July, sparked by the jailing of his predecessor as-president, Jacob Zuma, for defying the Constitutional Court, underlines the risks ahead.
- The debilitating socioeconomic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, exacerbated by July's unrest, highlights the need for urgent remedial action and will help to build support within the ANC for the president's reformist agenda, albeit reluctantly in some cases. Policy will focus on vaccine rollouts, reconstruction, infrastructure investment (led by the private sector) and boosting electricity supply. Fiscal constraints point to an increased reliance on public private partnerships. The fightback against corruption will gather momentum in 2021, as shown by Mr Zuma's jailing and the ANC's suspension of its secretary-general, Ace Magashule, in May, for defying orders to step aside.
- Following a severe recession in 2020, with real GDP shrinking by 7% because of the pandemic, we expect a modest growth rebound in 2021, to 3%, helped by low interest rates and higher commodity prices, although power shortages, a slow vaccine rollout and unrest-linked damage will preclude a more rapid rebound. We envisage growth averaging 2.7% a year in 2022-25, underpinned by structural reforms, but unemployment will continue to weigh on aggregate demand.
- The budget deficit soared to 11% of GDP in fiscal year 2020/21 (April March), but will trend lower, helped by wage restraint and revenue gains from higher commodity prices. Debt risks remain high but will subside if fiscal consolidation plans are fulfilled. Cumulative interest-rate cuts in 2020 took the benchmark to 3.5%, providing relief to borrowers, but the next move will be upwards, either later in 2021 or early in 2022, reflecting global trends.
- After easing to a multi-year low of 3.2% in 2020, average inflation will rise to 4% in 2021, owing to costlier oil, electricity and logistics, but weak demand will keep price growth subdued. Inflation will quicken to 4.5% a year on average in 2022 25 as economic growth stages a gradual post-pandemic recovery.
- South Africa recorded a rare current-account surplus in 2020, of 2.2% of GDP, as exports fell more slowly than imports, pushing up the merchandise trade surplus. Trends in 2021, including buoyant exports, point to another (albeit smaller) current-account surplus, before the return of a deficit in 2022-25 as imports regain traction.

- South Africa's business environment score improves for 2021-25, although its global ranking drops by two positions, and its regional ranking is unchanged from 2016-20. Market opportunity and infrastructure gains will be partly offset by deteriorations in macroeconomic stability and taxation.

Country forecast overview: South Africa's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: A post-pandemic investment drive, focused on infrastructure, facilitates public-private partnerships. Challenges include tighter competition laws and stricter black economic empowerment (BEE) rules.
2023-25: Expropriation without compensation, to speed up land reform, applies in limited circumstances only, reducing the threat to property rights. Investment incentives in selected industries (such as automotive manufacturing) remain in place.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: A reworked mining charter offers some concessions to business. A new foreign investment law limits access to international arbitration by giving local courts the primary responsibility for handling disputes.
2023-25: The government continues to encourage foreign investment and public-private partnerships, but resists the full privatisation of state assets in most cases.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: The government implements a further relaxation of capital controls on outward investment and other flows.
2023-25: Progress towards regional economic integration in Southern Africa makes some advances, but barriers persist.
Taxes 2021-22: Despite tough fiscal conditions, the government avoids major tax increases to shield households and firms.
2023-25: Efforts to streamline and modernise the tax system and expand the tax base continue.
Financing 2021-22: Special pandemic liquidity measures are phased out in 2021, but interest rates remain low, before edging higher in 2022. Local banks remain sound and a major source of corporate financing, despite profits being squeezed by the pandemic.
2023-25: The continued independence of the South African Reserve Bank (the central bank) helps to preserve financial system stability. Monetary policy remains prudent and interest rates edge higher. The proposed nationalisation of the central bank is put on hold.
The labour market 2021-22: Pandemic-induced job losses oblige trade unions to accept a mild relaxation of currently inflexible labour laws.
2023-25: The labour market remains tough, owing to skills shortages and BEE targets.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Investment in transport and electricity, led in many cases by private firms, boosts capacity.
2023-25: Private-sector-led investment in renewable energy gathers momentum under the government's long-term energy plan, adding diversity to power supplies and cutting reliance on coal. Rising power tariffs drive energy efficiency.
Technological readiness 2021-22: The rollout of domestic fibre-optic cables boosts capacity and cuts costs. Investment in digital technology gathers momentum, including in 5G, cloud computing and high-end data analysis. The allocation of new spectrum boosts capacity
2023-25: Work advances on the Square Kilometre Array-a powerful radio telescope with multinational support-giving a wider boost to science and to information and communications technology.

Background: South Africa became a full democracy in 1994, when it first held all-race elections. The African National Congress (ANC) won and has dominated all subsequent elections-in 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019. However, support ebbed steadily from a peak of nearly 70% in 2004, to 62.1% in 2014 and 57.5% in May 2019. The ANC feared a worse result in in 2019, but the installation of Cyril Ramaphosa as president in February 2018, replacing the scandal-tainted Jacob Zuma, provided a mild bounce. Barring shocks, Mr Ramaphosa will serve a full five-year term, ending in 2024 and would be eligible for a second term.
Political structure: South Africa is a constitutional democracy with a bicameral parliament and a president elected by parliament. The constitution is the supreme law. The National Assembly is elected by proportional representation; the National Council of the Provinces consists of indirectly elected representatives of the nine provinces. The judiciary is independent and includes an 11-member Constitutional Court. The constitution provides for an independent corruption watchdog-the Public Protector-and commissions on human rights, gender equality and restitution of land rights.
Policy issues: The main policy focus in 2021-25 will be to facilitate recovery from a severe recession in 2020 caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The need to boost post-pandemic growth, underlined by unrest in July, will allow Mr Ramaphosa to push ahead more forcefully with his reformist agenda. A new economic recovery and reconstruction plan, devised in consultation with business and labour unions, will focus on investment in critical infrastructure (such as housing and transport), led by the private sector, alongside a large-scale public works programme to create jobs. Tackling power shortages by commissioning new capacity from independent power producers, and by restructuring Eskom, the highly-indebted electricity parastatal, is another key objective. Fiscal constraints point to an increased reliance on public-private partnerships, despite resistance from vested interests. A new draft expropriation bill sets clear limits on when compensation is not payable, thus diminishing the threat to property rights and investor confidence. Challenges include skills shortages, stricter competition laws and the perennial risk of strikes.
Taxation: Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a flat rate of 15%-after a rise from 14% on April 1st 2018-although some essentials are zero-rated. Corporation tax (of 28%), income tax and VAT were left unchanged in the 2021/22 budget, but a corporation tax reduction is earmarked for 2022/23. Some tax concessions are available, including in special economic zones.
Foreign trade: South Africa has a relatively open economy, with foreign trade (imports plus exports) accounting for about 52% of GDP. China, the EU, the US and Japan are among its largest trading partners. Trade with the rest of Africa has become progressively more important and makes a large contribution to South Africa's merchandise trade surplus.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability Recovering from the coronavirus pandemic and a deep recession in 2020 will confront South Africa with unparalleled challenges, aggravated by a week of serious unrest and looting in July, after a former president, Jacob Zuma, was jailed for 15 months for defying the constitutional court. Mr Zuma's incarceration underlines the supremacy of the rule of law and reinforces the authority of the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, but the violence-resulting from incitement by pro-Zuma factions and opportunistic criminality-is a serious political and economic setback, which is also disrupting the ongoing vaccination rollout, especially in Mr Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal, the epicentre of disorder. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects calm to be restored fairly quickly, supported by troop deployments, but 117 lives have been lost so far, alongside many more livelihoods, and the damage costs will exceed R10bn (US$690m).
The ramifications of July's violent disorder are still not fully clear, but we expect pro-Zuma factions in the ruling African National Congress (ANC) to suffer a loss of credibility, to the benefit of Mr Ramaphosa and his allies, despite the government's initially hesitant response to the unrest. Since being elected for a five-year term in May 2019, Mr Ramaphosa has struggled to unite the ANC's disparate factions behind a reformist agenda, but a severe recession in 2020, accompanied by heavy job losses and rising poverty and compounded by shock at the recent violence, underlines the need for urgent action to repair the economy, including by working more closely with private business. Resistance to reforms by powerful interest groups (such as labour unions and left-wing interventionists in the government) is fading because of the state's financial and technical capacity constraints, and the absence of any other coherent strategy to revive the economy. The pending privatisation of a slimmed-down South African Airways, announced in June, underlines an acceptance by the left (albeit reluctant) of a more prominent private-sector role.
Despite the violence unleashed by Mr Zuma's imprisonment, his allies in the ANC-the so-called radical economic transformation movement-will lose influence and political authority. Mr Zuma's imprisonment is a significant step in the fightback against impunity and corruption, which he nurtured during his presidency (2009-18) and will be followed by his next hearing in a separate corruption trial, on long-standing charges, which resumed on July 19th. Reinforcing the message, the ANC suspended its secretary-general, Ace Magashule (Mr Zuma's key ally) in May, because of corruption allegations against him. Given the powerful role played by the secretary-general in choosing election candidates and organising key summits, Mr Magashule's suspension (ahead of his next court appearance, in August), gives Mr Ramaphosa a valuable opportunity to reshape party structures and policies, and to carry out a long-proposed cabinet reshuffle. Policy debates will continue, but Mr Ramaphosa's tighter grip on the ANC improves the outlook for the key structural reforms needed to bolster economic growth and job creation.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch The next major political event is the ANC's five-yearly National General Council (NGC)-a policy implementation review-which will give a clearer indication of the balance of forces in the party and the extent of Mr Ramaphosa's control. After being delayed by more than a year by the pandemic, the NGC's timing is still uncertain, although we expect it to take place before the next five-yearly municipal elections on October 27th 2021. The nationwide ballot will give voters the first chance to judge the government's pandemic response and will be a test of Mr Ramaphosa's and the ANC's popularity, especially in the wake of July's disorder, which will have an uncertain electoral impact. The party would be broadly satisfied by an ANC voting share in the 55-60% range in 2021 (compared with 57.5% in the 2019 general election), but a drop into the 50-55% range could see Mr Ramaphosa facing a leadership challenge at the ANC's next electoral summit in December 2022. We expect the ANC, under Mr Ramaphosa, to retain power at the next general election (in 2024), but with a smaller majority than in 2019. The implementation of the new Political Party Funding Act in April 2021 will strengthen transparency.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations South Africa-the most advanced economy in Africa and a major business hub-will remain deeply engaged in the continent, particularly in Southern and Central/East Africa. Despite a challenging environment, South Africa will continue to attract international companies, including from the US, Europe and Asia, owing to strong institutions, sound banks and its role as the continental gateway. South Africa's commercial involvement in other African markets will remain broad-based, covering mining, banking, telecommunications, retail and hospitality. The pandemic is causing temporary disruption to regional relations because of periodic border closures and flight bans, aggravated by a third wave of Covid-19, but regional access for South African-based firms will improve in 2021-22, helped by vaccine rollouts.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends The government's most immediate policy challenge is to revive the economy after a pandemic-induced contraction in 2020, which inflicted lasting damage on many households and firms. A week of serious unrest, looting and property destruction in July, after the former president, Mr Zuma, was imprisoned, will compound the difficulties and require new support measures. On the pandemic front, vaccinations are gathering pace, reaching some 4.9m (11.7% of adults) on July 15th, despite being disrupted by the recent unrest, which is helping to blunt a third wave of Covid-19. New cases hit an all-time high of 137,861 in the week ending July 9th, accompanied by 2,541 deaths, but subsequent trends point to a decline in both metrics, potentially allowing for the relaxation of tighter restrictions that were imposed in mid-June. The Covid-19 outlook remains uncertain but is showing a mild improvement, despite recent disorder.
The government will attempt to engineer a growth rebound in 2021-25, via targeted measures and deeper structural reforms, although the scope for additional monetary and fiscal intervention is limited. With the benchmark interest rate at a record low of 3.5%, there is no scope for further cuts, while several years of heavy spending and rising budget deficits preclude a broad-based fiscal stimulus. Even before the pandemic, South Africa was trapped in a low-growth trajectory-not for the want of pro-growth plans but because of policy fudges and weak implementation. The pandemic, by exposing underlying fault lines (such as widespread poverty and inequality) and highlighting the need for urgent action, will potentially be a catalyst for deeper and faster structural reforms, including a greater role for the private sector.
Devised in consultation with business and organised labour, an economic recovery plan will focus on job creation-via large-scale public works programmes-and infrastructure investment. The plan aims to channel R100bn (US$6.8bn) over ten years into an infrastructure fund with the aim of attracting a ten-times greater sum from the private sector via public-private partnerships. Target projects range from housing to network infrastructure, and include allowing private participation in the rail network and ports. Facilitating solely private initiatives (such as in mining) via regulatory loosening is another pivotal aim, but uncertainties in key areas, such as land expropriation, will weigh on business confidence.
A paramount policy objective is restoring energy security by adding new capacity (mostly solar and wind) from independent power producers and by lifting the cap on self-generation without a licence ten-fold, to 100 MW (in June). The planned auction of new broadband spectrum in 2021 could give a major boost to communication and digitalisation. Despite these encouraging signs, spectrum allocation is being delayed by a legal dispute, and electricity supply will remain tight, with a high risk of load-shedding (power cuts), before the situation improves in 2023. The restructuring of dysfunctional parastatal enterprises, especially Eskom, the heavily indebted power firm, is a central, interlinked objective. Implementation remains a challenge, but the political will to act is now stronger. Commitments to the IMF in return for a rapid financing instrument in 2020 will add impetus to reforms in the face of resistance from vested interests.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy A surge in the budget deficit to about 11% of GDP in fiscal year 2020/21 (April-March) reflects heavy revenue losses and higher spending during the pandemic and recession. The 2020/21 outcome was, nonetheless, smaller than the 15.7% of GDP shortfall predicted by the Treasury last October, because of a belated revenue boost from higher commodity prices, alongside gains from an overhaul of the South African Revenue Service (the tax agency). The brighter revenue outlook means that planned tax increases in 2021/22 were put on hold and a vaccine rollout costing an initial R9bn (US$620m) over two years is fully funded. The 2021/22 budget, unveiled in February, outlines a path of medium-term fiscal consolidation premised on real-term cuts in the public-sector wage bill. We expect the shortfall as a percentage of GDP to ebb to 9.4% in 2021/22 and 7.6% in 2022/23, before easing to 3.4% in 2025/26. The biggest risks to fiscal consolidation are a fightback by labour unions against wage restraint (via a combination of legal action, political pressure and possible strikes) and the heavy debt burdens of parastatal enterprises.
After surging to about 78% of GDP in 2020/21 because of higher borrowing and a recession, the public debt burden will rise more slowly as fiscal revenue recovers, peaking at about 87.4% of GDP in 2024/25, before edging lower. Fiscal consolidation will reduce South Africa's risk of debt distress, as will the government's recourse to deep and liquid domestic capital markets to finance most of the budget shortfalls. Debt-servicing costs will continue rising, however, leaving limited room for slippage on either the spending or the revenue fronts. A failure to meet debt targets could oblige South Africa to undertake a formal IMF programme with strict conditions attached.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy Policy accommodation during the 2020 pandemic crisis will give way to a normalisation process in 2022, with interest rates edging higher as the economy begins to recover. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB, the central bank) cut the benchmark interest rate (repo rate) five times in 2020, by a cumulative 300 basis points to 3.5%, to help to shield the economy from the pandemic, and has kept the rate on hold in 2021 to date (most recently in May). As a further cut is unlikely, the SARB's next rate move will be upwards, possibly in late 2021 but probably in early 2022, as real GDP resumes growing and inflation edges higher. Additional small increases will follow in 2023-25, broadly tracking US trends.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth Following a steep contraction in 2020, of 7%, owing to the effects of the pandemic, we expect real GDP to grow by 3% in 2021, driven by a mildly better first-quarter outcome than expected, but structural constraints will preclude a faster rebound. Factors supporting growth in 2021 include an improved outlook for vaccine provision (after the government agreed contracts with Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer), higher commodity prices, stronger export demand, another good farm season and the maintenance of low interest rates. Growth downsides that will dampen the rebound in 2021 include a 3.2% year-on-year contraction in the first quarter (because of the pre-pandemic baseline), persistent electricity supply constraints, weak tourism and hospitality, and elevated unemployment, which will sap aggregate demand. The jobless rate edged up to a new record of 32.6% in January-March. An ongoing third wave of Covid-19 and a week of violent unrest in July (after Mr Zuma was imprisoned) will also stifle the pace of recovery. A series of public-sector strikes in response to real-term wage cuts is another significant risk.
As the 2021 rebound largely reflects a very weak baseline in 2020, we expect growth to edge lower again in 2022, to 2.4%. The economy will benefit from stronger private investment in response to favourable policy initiatives (such as moves to facilitate public-private partnerships) and from a gradual relaxation of power supply constraints, although most additions to generating capacity will not come on stream until the second half of 2022 at the earliest. Other hurdles to growth in 2022 will be a global slowdown (after a 2021 rebound), persistently high unemployment and still-fragile tourism. Our growth forecast strengthens to 2.8% a year on average in 2023-25, underpinned by long-delayed reforms (such as parastatal restructuring) and the spread of digital technology, but the global backdrop will remain subdued in terms of economic growth and trade flows.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation After dipping to a multi-year low of 3.2% in 2020, owing to recession, cheaper imported oil and a bumper food harvest, inflation will rise to 4% in 2021, but will remain comfortably within the SARB's 3-6% target range. The primary sources of inflation in 2021 will be higher oil prices, electricity tariffs and logistics costs, although a second consecutive bumper harvest in the 2020/21 season will partly offset higher global food prices. Other factors curbing inflation are rand appreciation in 2021, weak aggregate demand (owing to unemployment and income losses), spare industrial capacity and strong retail competition. We expect inflation to quicken to an average of 4.5% a year in 2022-25, spurred by a modest revival in GDP growth, but the level will stay within the SARB's target range, temporary breaches aside.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates Stronger commodity prices and global liquidity injections will support the rand in 2021, as shown by an 18.7% year-on-year appreciation of the currency to R13.92:US$1 in June-its strongest level for over two years. Being commodity-dependent, widely traded and an emerging-market proxy, the rand will benefit from a positive global backdrop, but it remains vulnerable to any adverse shifts in global sentiment and to negative domestic developments. US signposting of faster monetary tightening alongside recent unrest in South Africa mean that the rand is losing ground in July. In conjunction with South Africa's large fiscal deficit and sluggish growth outlook, we see the rand ending 2021 at R14.92:US$1. On an annual average basis, we forecast strengthening to R14.43:US$1 in 2021 as markets normalise after disruption in 2020. The rand will remain volatile, often experiencing large daily movements in response to shifting sentiment, although South Africa's modest external debt stock and healthy foreign-exchange reserves are protective. Our forecast assumes gradual depreciation from 2022 onwards, with the rand slipping to R17.44:US$1 at end-2025, although the pace of decline will be close to the inflation rate, implying a relatively stable real effective exchange rate.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector The impact of the pandemic on the external accounts will persist in 2021, and we expect another rare current-account surplus and a net contribution to GDP growth. The pandemic led to a much steeper fall in imports than in exports in 2020, generating a large merchandise trade surplus, which offset the perennial deficit on invisible trade to produce a current-account surplus of 2.2% of GDP. In 2021 a healthy increase in export earnings (underpinned by higher commodity prices) will be surpassed by a rebound in imports as the economy recovers (and oil prices rise), reducing both the merchandise trade surplus and the current-account surplus (to 1.2% of GDP). Our forecast for 2022-25 envisages a return to a current-account deficit, with the shortfall averaging 2.4% of GDP a year, as the invisible trade deficit (underpinned by income outflows to foreign investors) surpasses the merchandise trade surplus. The current-account deficit will be smaller than pre-pandemic levels but will leave South Africa reliant on financial inflows to plug the gap. Foreign direct investment inflows will recover from 2021, helped by structural reforms that will encourage public-private partnerships and solely private initiatives in a range of sectors. We expect inflows of US$5.2bn a year on average in 2021-25 (just under 10% of gross financing needs). South Africa will remain a key base for multinational companies with pan-African operations by offering a range of services, including banking, capital-raising and trade-related functions.

Full text: - Despite Venezuela's socioeconomic collapse and the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, to retain power throughout the 2021-25 forecast period. Mr Maduro's position will be supported primarily by his grip over a complex security apparatus and the opposition's lack of de facto power. On this basis, we expect continued deterioration of the economy, sustained outward migration, and a poorer and more violent Venezuela. Despite US sanctions (and their impact on oil production), the Maduro regime has managed internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through its strict control over the security forces.
- The scale of the socioeconomic collapse and the elevated level of political instability will ensure that the Maduro regime continues to be challenged both economically and politically. In particular, there is a significant risk of regime change stemming from a possible breakdown in the patronage system that sustains the security forces' support of the regime. Under our baseline forecast, we assume that Mr Maduro will avoid this, as long as oil rents recover over the medium term, after bottoming out this year. However, there are substantial risks to this assumption stemming from the impact of US sanctions, weaker Chinese demand for Venezuelan crude and a fundamental lack of incentives for investment in the domestic oil industry.
- De facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding. Concurrently, the government has taken measures that have allowed the official exchange rate to float. These measures have aided price stability and therefore increased the availability of some basic goods. However, the measures are not a product of economic orthodoxy, but rather of policy decisions to ensure the regime's survival. We do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that would be required to resolve Venezuela's economic crisis within the forecast period.

- Venezuela ranks 82nd of 82 countries in the global business environment rankings for 2021-25, having been in 81st place in the 2016-20 historical period, as the economic crisis deepens despite minor improvements. Reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment are unlikely.

Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Enforcement of price controls remains lax, but risk of state intervention remains high. Corruption and selective application of regulations are common and continue to undermine free competition.
2023-25: Contract rights remain weak, and red tape and ad hoc interventionism continue.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Government efforts to revive foreign investment fail owing to US sanctions and political and economic instability.
2023-25: Investment flows remain low amid ongoing economic volatility. Intellectual property protection and private property rights deteriorate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Currency controls are weakened, but access to foreign currency remains limited. US sanctions hamper trade.
2023-25: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are undertaken on a gradual basis, and de facto dollarisation advances. Domestic supply of foreign currency remains limited as oil prices decline.
Taxes 2021-22: Risks of further unrest and political instability reduce probability of central government increasing taxes. However, municipal authorities raise taxes owing to funding shortfalls.
2023-25: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2021-22: Inflation remains high, and concerns surrounding economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2023-25: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2021-22: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Firms prohibited from firing workers until end-2022. Ongoing emigration of skilled labour aggravates skills shortages.
2023-25: Labour market rigidities persist despite some increased flexibility in hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Underinvestment in water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts.
2023-25: Investors remain highly cautious about committing to long-term capital projects. Infrastructure deteriorates even further.
Technological readiness 2021-22: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment, but with little interest. Local use of cryptocurrency expands among middle- and high-income households.
2023-25: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to restrict internet and mobile coverage.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013 proved unsuccessful. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his own popularity plummet, as his macroeconomic mismanagement-aggravated by wide-ranging US sanctions-has plunged the country into a state of economic collapse.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature to be in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. In August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly (ANC) granted itself control over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly. The ANC was dissolved at end-2020, after the PSUV and its allies regained control of the legislature in an election that was widely regarded as rigged.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise the crisis-ridden economy. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of PDVSA (the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country) has resulted in a sharp contraction in oil production. Attempts to address these problems through distortionary price and currency controls proved actively counter-productive and led to major shortages of both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by the sovereign and state-owned firms. The Maduro regime is now changing tack and pursuing incremental pro-market reforms, but its efforts are hindered by chronic economic instability, a lack of confidence in the legal framework and wide-ranging US sanctions.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the goods trade surplus fell to US$9.9bn in 2019, amid a long-term decline in oil exports. We estimate that the trade account deteriorated further in 2020, shifting to a US$2.9bn deficit.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV, the Chavistas), to remain in power throughout the 2021-25 forecast period, despite its role in fomenting the country's ongoing socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis. A number of factors underpin our forecast; particularly significant is the regime's strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces. This control, which depends on a patronage system that rewards the loyalty of high-ranking officials, will allow the regime to manage internal dissent.
In our view, the domestic opposition will pose little threat to Mr Maduro's power. Having retaken control of the National Assembly from the opposition in January, the Chavistas have unchecked authority over all branches of government. Political control is nominally disputed by Juan Guaidó, the leader of the Frente Amplio Venezuela Libre (FAVL) opposition alliance and self-declared interim president, but the opposition lacks de facto power. Mr Guaidó retains the backing of most Western powers, including the US, which he has used to co-ordinate a "maximum pressure" campaign against the Maduro regime. However, with these hardline tactics failing to deliver results-and in some cases proving counterproductive-domestic support for Mr Guaidó is waning.
Against this backdrop, the PSUV has made gestures in recent weeks aimed at facilitating rapprochement with the opposition, with a view to securing sanctions relief from the US. One significant concession by the regime is the inclusion of two opposition representatives on the five-member board of the newly appointed electoral authority (CNE). Ahead of forthcoming regional and local elections on November 21st, the CNE has taken a number of steps to rebuild confidence in Venezuela's electoral system. These include a renewal of the electoral register, an audit of the automated voting system and invitations to international observers (including the EU and the UN) to oversee the November polls. The regime has also sought to launch fresh political negotiations, with a first round of talks to take place in August. However, these gestures appear to be largely cosmetic, and Mr Maduro is unlikely to acquiesce to any process that would actually threaten his grip on power. A renewed crackdown on opposition leaders in mid-July reinforces our view that Mr Maduro is not engaging in good faith. As a result, the long-running political stalemate is likely to persist.
Nevertheless, there is a high degree of risk attached to our forecast that Mr Maduro will remain in power. In our view, there are two main paths to a change of government: a negotiated transition, or some sort of internal coup. Notwithstanding the potential for increased multilateral engagement, we believe that a negotiated transition would be difficult, as trust issues between the two sides are insurmountable. Bearing this in mind, we believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The regime's main weakness is the fragility of its internal finances, which are heavily dependent on revenue from PDVSA, the state-owned oil company. The government's patronage system is crucial for sustaining its security apparatus and stamping out social unrest. The regime's finances have already come under severe strain, owing to the combination of extreme macroeconomic mismanagement and US sanctions. In the near term, a recently announced Chinese policy measure will deal PDVSA's oil rents yet another blow-from mid-June the Chinese government will levy a hefty tax on imports of bitumen blends. The move is likely to hit demand from independent Chinese refineries for Venezuelan crude (which is typically rebranded as bitumen mix from Malaysia to bypass US sanctions). The regime will continue to benefit from funds from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities, but a lack of hard currency could prove fatal to the patronage system, and will test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks and control over the security apparatus. The regime's liquidity problems-along with the country's deepening socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis-could therefore prompt putsch attempts in the near term.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch A legislative election was held in December 2020 to select the 277 members of the unicameral National Assembly. The vote, which was boycotted by most opposition parties, was widely regarded as neither free nor fair. The results were therefore unsurprising: the Gran Polo Patriótico, an electoral alliance dominated by the PSUV, won an overwhelming supermajority of 256 seats in the legislature.
Next on the electoral calendar are regional and local elections (to elect governors, mayors and their legislative counterparts), which will take place on November 21st. We believe that the regime will try to use negotiations over electoral conditions as a first step towards gaining international legitimacy and some degree of sanctions relief. However, these efforts are unlikely to yield results, particularly given that the regime is not serious about allowing truly competitive polls that could put its dominance at the subnational level at risk. The PSUV's control of the majority of the CNE board and its unfettered influence over the judicial branch are designed to guard against such an outcome. In addition, the legislature is also debating a bill on "communal cities" that could be used to install a parallel governance structure if the opposition's electoral performance surprises on the upside. Despite these issues, some pragmatic members of the opposition are still likely to participate in the November polls, in a bid to make inroads into a political system from which they have been shut out. However, we do not expect a shift in the balance of power.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations The Maduro regime's main foreign policy challenge will be managing its combative ties with the US. The administration led by the former US president, Donald Trump (2017-21), instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions as part of a systematic campaign designed to undermine the regime. Although the aggressive sanctions policy did not produce its intended outcome, it did accelerate the decline of Venezuela's oil industry. Mr Maduro will look to reset ties with the US under the new president, Joe Biden, but we expect little progress. US policy towards Venezuela has bipartisan support in the US, and Mr Biden is unlikely to provide significant sanctions relief unless the Maduro regime makes major political compromises and commits to democratic reform (both of which are highly improbable). Any changes to US sanctions policy will therefore be only on humanitarian grounds and aimed at improving the lives of the poorest Venezuelans, as evidenced by recent exemptions granted for coronavirus-related transactions and imports of liquefied petroleum gas.
Another major challenge for the Maduro regime comes from a traditional ally: China. Despite having previously extended significant financial aid to the regime, the Chinese government has scaled back its support in recent years, following non-payment of liabilities by Venezuela. China's surprise decision to tax bitumen imports has complicated relations further. Our baseline view is that the policy move was motivated by domestic considerations, namely China's desire to support its state-owned refineries at the cost of independent ones. Assuming that this is the case, the Chinese authorities are likely to permit Venezuelan crude to enter the country in other ways. However, we do not entirely discount the possibility that China has lost confidence in the Maduro regime. If this is the case, PDVSA could face significantly restricted access to its main export market, with wide-ranging implications for Venezuela's political and economic outlook. Although Venezuela will continue to enjoy strong diplomatic ties with Iran and Russia, neither country will be willing to provide game-changing amounts of finance in 2021-25.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends The Maduro regime's immediate policy priorities will be to contain the public health crisis caused by Covid-19, alleviate ongoing diesel shortages and reverse a long-running economic collapse. However, progress (if any) on each of these goals will be limited.
To combat the coronavirus pandemic, the government is maintaining its "Fórmula 7+7 Plus" strategy, which involves alternating between a week of tighter restrictions and a week of more relaxed ones. However, this has so far failed to prevent fresh waves of the virus, increasing pressure on Venezuela's decrepit medical infrastructure. Meanwhile the country's vaccine rollout has stalled owing to problems with procurement and distribution (as at mid-July only about 10% of the population had received at least one dose). We do not expect that enough doses of the vaccine will be distributed to have a significant impact on local transmission until 2023.
In an effort to address severe diesel shortages, the government has sought to increase domestic output by restarting operations at key refineries. However, the government's fix is not a viable long-term solution, mainly because producing diesel requires light crude, which is in limited supply. To ramp up domestic diesel output, PDVSA has had to cut back on blending operations of heavy crude from the Orinoco oil belt (which is limiting overall production and exports of crude oil). The government has also sought to intermittently import diesel through intermediaries, but it has limited foreign currency to increase its imports on the scale required. As a result, we believe that a long-term remedy will hinge on the Biden administration reinstating exemptions on crude-for-diesel swaps. We believe that this is likely later this year as the local humanitarian crisis deepens, but risks to this assumption are high.
Reversing Venezuela's economic decline will be a similarly difficult task. The most pressing challenge for the government will be to retain its market share in China following the imposition of the bitumen tax (which amounts to about US$30/barrel). In the immediate term, we expect that PDVSA will offer even steeper discounts on its crude, effectively wiping out a large share of its margin. That said, even with price concessions, some Chinese refineries will probably turn to importing benchmark grades instead of Venezuelan barrels, which are subject to sanctions. The longer-term solution to Venezuela's conundrum will ultimately depend on what the Chinese authorities are comfortable with. Chinese state-owned companies could resume direct purchases of Venezuelan oil, but this would expose them to secondary sanctions by the US. A more probable outcome is that China will grant flexibility-around either enforcement of the bitumen tax, oil import quotas or both-to some select independent refiners that import Venezuelan crude.
In the medium term, the regime will seek to pave the way for recovery by boosting private investment (given that the public sector is completely overstretched). The regime has promulgated an anti-blockade law, which gives the executive branch the unchecked authority to sign new deals with private firms and countries confidentially (in order to skirt international sanctions), without going through public tender processes. Concurrently, the regime is working on a hydrocarbons reform that would incentivise greater private-sector participation in the oil industry. However, these efforts are unlikely to yield significant results; even assuming that the regime manages to sidestep financial sanctions, it will struggle to attract new investment, given the abysmal business environment and a lack of confidence in the rule of law.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy The authorities have not published complete data on the fiscal accounts since 2011. However, we expect that a high level of inefficient current expenditure, combined with an extremely weak revenue intake, will keep the budget deficit wide and the public debt/GDP ratio above 300% throughout the 2021-25 forecast period. The sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will continue to prevent access to external finance, leaving the regime reliant on monetisation to fund its deficits. Even if the government reaches an agreement with some of its creditors (including China) to restructure debt liabilities in 2021-25, we still expect the public debt burden to remain huge, particularly as considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing-mainly PDVSA-issued debt and development funds-understate the true size of total public liabilities.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy Monetary policy will remain subservient to fiscal policy as the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) continues to print money to finance the government's gaping budget deficits. In recent years the BCV has taken steps to control growth of monetary aggregates-for instance in early 2020 it lifted the cash reserve ratio (CRR) to 93%, although it has relaxed the CRR slightly since that peak, to 85% currently. Far from taming inflation, these measures have led to the complete destruction of private-sector credit, which stands at less than 1% of levels recorded four years ago. These factors have accelerated the trend towards greater use of the US dollar in the economy; almost two-thirds of financial transactions now take place in dollars.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 31% in 2020, we expect real GDP to decline by a further 14% in 2021. As a consequence, GDP will have contracted by almost four-fifths since its 2013 peak.
The short-term outlook for the oil sector has worsened markedly in the light of the expected drop in demand from China, Venezuela's main export market. In theory, the government could divert excess output to the domestic economy, but state-owned refineries lack the processing capacity to handle such large volumes of crude (as evidenced by the ongoing diesel crisis). Therefore, as export bottlenecks emerge, PDVSA will have little choice but to cut production at its main facilities, given its beleaguered finances. We assume that the disruption will be temporary and that external demand will creep up over time as PDVSA and its trading partners find ways around US sanctions and Chinese taxes. However, the balance of risks is tilted heavily to the downside.
For its part, the non-oil economy will show little improvement early on in the forecast period, especially as an uncontrolled pandemic limits prospects for services activities. In the medium term, however, we expect some modest gains, assuming that continued dollarisation engenders relative macroeconomic stability. Nonetheless, we expect that Venezuela's GDP (in real terms) will be only about half its 2018 level, even in 2025.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation A severely reduced domestic goods supply, constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits will impede the disinflationary process in 2021-25. The regime has shown little inclination to take on the fiscal and macroeconomic reforms that would address the root causes of inflation. It has, however, lent its support to an ongoing process of de facto dollarisation, which will help to ease price pressures over time.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates Hyperinflation will sustain bolívar depreciation in 2021. Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency redenomination (as in March 2018) is a strong possibility. Although a number of currency regulations officially remain on the books, the regime has largely stopped enforcing them in its recent embrace of dollarisation.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector Balance-of-payments pressures will remain severe in 2021-25, contributing to goods shortages and economic inequities. Foreign reserves stood at US$6.2bn in June-their lowest level in three decades. This steep decline, which has been several years in the making, reflects poor policymaking and a lack of economic diversification in the country's external sector.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect reserves to fall to US$5.9bn this year, before recovering to US$7.9bn by 2025. These trends will be driven entirely by transactions on the current account, as Venezuela's access to foreign direct and portfolio investment will remain extremely limited. We expect the current-account deficit to remain wide, at 6% of GDP in 2021, before the balance shifts to a surplus of 1.1% of GDP in 2022. Thereafter, the account will remain in surplus, averaging 1.8% of GDP in 2023-25. Crucially, our forecasts assume that export earnings will recover from a nadir this year. We also expect that workers' remittances from abroad will play a crucial role in propping up the current-account balance.

Abstract: The Bank of England (BoE, the central bank) has cut its policy interest rate to an historic low of 0.1% and authorised £450bn (US$620bn) in bond purchases to keep government borrowing costs low.

Full text: - At a general election on December 12th 2019 the Conservative Party, under the prime minister, Boris Johnson, won an emphatic 80-seat majority. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to serve its full term.
- On January 1st 2021 the UK left the EU's single market and customs union, having reached a free-trade agreement, the EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA), in December. Although this provides for no tariffs and no quotas, its provisions are significantly less comprehensive than EU membership and have created substantial non-tariff barriers.
- The UK-EU relationship will continue to evolve, with many issues being deferred. Relations may come under greater strain if the UK pursues a different regulatory course, which would entail additional future tariffs. Northern Ireland is a flashpoint; grace periods limiting the extent of customs checks on goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK are due to expire in October. Further trade disruption would further exacerbate discontent among unionist communities, which already led to rioting in April.
- The coronavirus pandemic led to the suspension of significant economic activity for most of 2020 and into 2021. There have been three lockdowns, which involved the closing of all non-essential retail, the last of which is only now being relaxed. Real GDP declined by 9.8% in 2020. We expect it to rebound by 5.7% in 2021 and 5.6% in 2022, reaching pre-crisis levels in 2o22.
- The Treasury committed to a series of coronavirus-related support schemes for business, and a furlough scheme to pay 80% of workers' wages. In response to a rise in coronavirus cases in autumn 2020, these schemes have been extended to autumn 2021. We forecast this to cause public debt to peak at over 107% of GDP in 2021. The government has announced a rise in corporation tax from 2023, and more tax rises are probably necessary to stabilise debt as a percentage of GDP by 2025, which we expect it to do (at roughly 105% of GDP).
- The Bank of England (BoE, the central bank) has cut its policy interest rate to an historic low of 0.1% and authorised £450bn (US$620bn) in bond purchases to keep government borrowing costs low. It has also approved short-term monetary financing of government spending, given the economic costs of the counter-crisis measures. We expect interest rates to stay close to zero until 2022, even though inflation will exceed the BoE's 2% target in 2021 and 2022.

- The UK's business environment score rises slightly in the forecast period (2021-25) as Brexit- and pandemic-related uncertainty dissipates. The UK's global ranking drops by four places, owing to greater increases elsewhere, while its regional ranking falls by one place. Brexit has worsened the UK's terms of trade, but the country's strengths-a pro-business policy stance, a welcoming attitude to foreign investment, and flexible labour and product markets-will continue.

Country forecast overview: United Kingdom's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Extraordinary state support for coronavirus-affected businesses. A 130% "super-deduction" on capital investment.
2023-25: Continued elevated state intervention in investment and innovation. New state aid rules implemented.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Continued openness to investment, although increased scrutiny in sectors considered sensitive to national security.
2023-25: Infrastructure plans offer investment opportunities. Possible changes in tax policies to bolster inward investment.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Increased trade barriers with EU. New Northern Ireland protocol implemented. Negotiations continue with third countries. Expected decline in UK-EU crossborder trade. Bounce-back in global trade following pandemic.
2023-25: Continued UK-EU negotiations probable. New trade agreements with other countries, including potential accession to Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) trade bloc.
Taxes 2021-22: Tax holidays and deferments throughout the coronavirus crisis. Changes to the value-added tax (VAT) framework.
2023-25: Corporation tax increase from 19% to 25%. Additional tax rises, such as equalisation of self-employed and regular income taxes, likely to fund public spending and investment.
Financing 2021-22: Monetary policy remains highly accommodative, with Bank of England (central bank) asset purchases continuing. Loss of "passporting" rights and restrictions on EU services trade. Slow progress in establishing equivalence with EU.
2023-25: Modest decline in City of London's status. Steady growth in alternative forms of debt financing.
The labour market 2021-22: Increased unemployment as furlough scheme expires. Pandemic-related departure of expatriates and sharp drop in immigration from EU owing to end to free movement of labour. Increased immigration from Hong Kong.
2023-25: Greater emphasis on skills-based migration from outside EU may risk labour shortages in low-skilled occupations.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Modest rise in spending on housing, roads and digital infrastructure. Crossrail service in London begins operation in 2022.
2023-25: Increased infrastructure investment, emphasis on "levelling up" regional infrastructure and competitiveness.
Technological readiness 2021-22: High e-commerce penetration and strong research base, but research and development (R&D) spending remains below EU average. Continued high threat from cybercrime and cyber-espionage.
2023-25: Modest rise in public R&D spending. Development of state "blue skies" fund.

Background: The end of the second world war coincided with the decline of the UK as an imperial power. Residual links with former colonial territories, close relations with the US and a separate sense of identity delayed UK membership of the European Community (now the EU) until 1973. Successive governments resisted closer EU integration. The UK left the EU in January 2020, following a referendum in June 2016, although it remains in a transition period until December 31st. The future contours of the UK's relationship with the EU are uncertain, but a diminution of UK influence in the region appears to be inevitable.
Political structure: The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II. Parliament has an elected House of Commons (the lower house, 650 seats) and a non-elected House of Lords (the upper house, non-fixed membership of about 800). The snap general election in December 2019 produced a majority government for the centre-right Conservative Party, which won 365 seats. The main opposition Labour Party won 202 seats, with smaller parties winning the remaining 83. This government is expected to serve out its full term until the next scheduled election, in 2024.
Policy issues: The coronavirus outbreak has dominated UK politics since March 2020. After a modest level of fiscal and monetary consolidation, the government has embarked on massive fiscal expansion to support workers and businesses affected by the virus and containment measures, while the Bank of England (the central bank) has moved rates to record lows, which is likely to persist into 2021. The fallout from the Brexit vote will also dominate the policy agenda; The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to focus efforts managing the economic impact of its departure from the EU and on reducing the damaging effect on the economy of the uncertainty created by the coronavirus. Maintaining competitiveness in this environment will force policymakers to address structural deficiencies such as low productivity.
Taxation: The headline rate of corporation tax has been reduced steadily, from 28% in 2010 to 19% since April 2018. There are three bands of personal income tax, set at 20%, 40% and 45% (the 45% rate came into effect in April 2013, replacing the 50% rate introduced in 2010). The standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 20% (raised from 17.5% in 2011). Excise duties on tobacco and alcohol are among the highest in Europe.
Foreign trade: In 2020 exports of goods totalled US$399bn and imports amounted to US$548bn, resulting in a trade deficit of US$149bn. The services surplus expanded to US$138bn. The overall current-account deficit widened in absolute terms, from US$87.6bn in 2019 to US$95.4bn, widening as a share of GDP, from 3.1% to 3.5%.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability At the general election on December 12th 2019 the Conservative Party, under the prime minister, Boris Johnson, won an 80-seat majority. On January 31st 2020 Mr Johnson fulfilled his campaign promise to take the UK out of the EU, ending 47 years of EU membership. On January 1st 2021 the UK left the EU's single market and customs union after negotiating a free-trade agreement. The government is currently managing the implementation of a new trading relationship with the EU while addressing the fallout from the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Despite the challenges posed by these two issues, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to last a full term.
The spread of the coronavirus in early 2020 put the government on a crisis-management footing. Since March 2020 the government has implemented three lockdowns in England, with many non-essential businesses being closed. Devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland enacted similar restrictions during these periods. Many domestic restrictions under the third lockdown have been relaxed, but the lifting of all remaining restrictions has been delayed from June 21st to July 19th, as the more contagious Delta coronavirus variant has led to an ongoing third sharp spike in cases. Nonetheless, the success of the UK's vaccination programme (with 86% of adults having received a first dose and 64% a second as at July 7th) has meant that the increase in overall hospitalisations has been minimal, allowing the reopening to proceed.
Brexit and the pandemic have increased the medium-term risk to the integrity of the UK. Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), has argued that Brexit represents a material change in the relationship between Scotland and the UK since the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, in which a majority favoured the continuation of the union. Support for Scottish independence spiked during the initial phase of the pandemic, as Scottish voters viewed their devolved government's response as more effective than that of the UK government. This has ebbed since the vaccination campaign began; recent opinion polls show a lead for support for the union, although within the margin of error.
The SNP-with the support of the pro-independence Scottish Green Party-has held a majority in the Scottish Parliament since 2016. It made modest gains in the May 2021 elections, which Ms Sturgeon claims give her a mandate to pursue a second referendum. However, we do not believe that these gains will produce sufficient political pressure to force the UK government to grant a referendum in this parliamentary term. Even if it were to do so, the poll would take several years to organise. Furthermore, divisions within pro-independence parties may undermine the unity of the movement. We therefore believe that there are significant obstacles to Scotland becoming independent and do not expect this to happen during the forecast period.
Brexit has inflamed tensions in Northern Ireland. The UK and the EU agreed to a separate protocol for Northern Ireland to avoid border checks with the Republic of Ireland. Under this agreement, Northern Ireland remains within a regulatory union with the EU for most goods. Although it will stay in the UK customs and value-added tax (VAT) areas, customs and VAT checks will be conducted by the UK on the EU's behalf at ports in the Irish Sea for goods bound for the EU. This requires the checkpoints and border infrastructure between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK for all goods deemed by a UK-EU joint committee to be "at risk" of passing into the EU.
This arrangement has been difficult to implement, and is disliked by Unionist Northern Irish politicians for ostensibly creating a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Rioting broke out in Northern Ireland on April 2nd and persisted for over a week. These protests originated among Unionist communities partly in opposition to the Irish Sea border checks. The UK and the EU have intensified talks around how to implement the Northern Ireland protocol, and a series of grace periods on the implementation of border checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK have been delayed until October 1st in an attempt to find a solution that will satisfy Unionist communities. However, the protocol will remain a source of UK-EU friction, as the EU will resist further extensions of these grace periods to avoid undermining the integrity of the single market. Despite these tensions, we expect the protocol to remain in place, given the commitments by both sides not to re-create a hard customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and the lack of a viable alternative. Tensions will remain elevated, and there is a high risk of further violence.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA), the next general election is scheduled for May 2nd 2024. The government has introduced a bill to repeal the FTPA. However, even once this is passed, a general election must be called within five years of the preceding one; they are usually held in May, to coincide with local elections. There is a risk of an early election in 2023; UK governments have often taken advantage of strong economic performance in the penultimate year of a parliament to consolidate their gains, rather than waiting for the parliament to expire.
During the pandemic, the Conservative Party's lead in opinion polls over the opposition Labour Party dropped from more than 20 percentage points at the outbreak of the crisis to a near-tie after several scandals and rapid policy reversals reduced public confidence in the government. Since the success of the vaccine rollout, the Conservatives' polling position has improved to a double-digit margin ahead of Labour, which may persist if the government is seen to manage the recovery well. Local elections on May 6th saw the Conservatives make gains on local councils, consistent with this level of polling lead.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations The EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA), which was reached on December 24th 2020, is a free-trade agreement that succeeds the UK's membership of the EU single market and customs union, following its exit from EU institutions on January 1st 2021. The TCA provides for zero-tariff, zero-quota trade between the UK and EU, at least in the first instance. However, leaving the single market and customs union has created a variety of non-tariff trade barriers in the forms of border checks and product certifications. The agreement also provides a mechanism whereby if the divergence in regulations on labour, the environment or state aid becomes sufficiently great, the other side can implement retaliatory tariffs to compensate, subject to an arbitration period.
The regulatory and tariff regimes may therefore drift apart over time. For example, the EU has found the UK's data protection regime "adequate" to allow for the free-flow of data between the UK and EU. However, the EU has committed to review this decision every four years, as the UK will not agree to remain in alignment with EU standards in any formal way. UK-EU negotiations are ongoing over the UK receiving designations of equivalence on financial services, although such an agreement looks increasingly unlikely. The UK has applied to rejoin the Lugano convention, which allows legal judgements to be enforced across borders, but several EU member states oppose non-EU countries joining the convention.
The UK government has stated its intention to be outward looking, pursuing a "Global Britain" strategy, and in March it unveiled an updated defence and security policy outlining a strategy of greater engagement in Asia, in addition to continued engagement in the Atlantic. The UK held the presidency of the G7 group of nations in June 2021 and will host the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow in November. It intends to use these platforms to take an enhanced role in global climate policy. On trade, the UK has achieved continuity agreements with most countries that had agreements with the EU, and has applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a trade bloc of 11 Pacific nations.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends Even before the pandemic, the UK faced significant economic policy challenges, including low public investment, wide regional disparities, high housing costs and chronically low productivity growth. However, the scale of the disruption caused by the virus is likely to dominate the government's policy focus at least until all extraordinary restrictions and support are withdrawn in 2022.
Since becoming the Conservative Party leader and prime minister, Mr Johnson has advocated greater public-sector investment, including in infrastructure, and additional current spending on the National Health Service, education and the police. The government has also reformed the UK's immigration system to emphasise skilled labour. Long-term social care is an area of health spending that Mr Johnson's manifesto pledged to address, alongside significant investment in green and renewable energy as part of a green recovery plan, although details for both remain vague. The government is also attempting to encourage public and private investment to address the UK's chronic low productivity, most prominently in a two-year tax "super-deduction" allowing companies to write off tax up to 130% of the value of their capital investment in 2021-23, as well as expanding the scope of public borrowing for investment from 2% of GDP to 3%. These initiatives are likely to yield modest benefits, but the UK's deficits in investment and productivity are long-standing issues and will not be reversed within a single parliamentary term.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy At the outbreak of the pandemic, the government enforced nationwide shutdowns and developed financial support packages to help workers and businesses. These included government-backstopped loans; several business tax deferments and holidays; targeted aid to the worst-affected sectors, such as travel and retail; and wage support schemes for salaried and self-employed workers. In its March budget, the government committed to extending most pandemic support measures into the autumn of 2021, only completely phasing them out by March 2022. We expect that this will lead to a fiscal deficit of 10.8% of GDP in 2021, with the debt/GDP ratio peaking at over 107%.
The budget also committed to greater fiscal consolidation, with a planned increase in corporation tax from 19% to 25% in 2023. However, this budget assumes highly ambitious increases in productivity growth and minimal increases in health, education and welfare spending from pre-pandemic levels after 2022; this is unlikely, given the government's campaign promises of greater spending and investment. We therefore expect further tax increases during the forecast period, with debt declining only marginally, to 105% of GDP by 2025.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy On March 19th 2020 the Bank of England (BoE, the central bank) cut its main rate to 0.1%-its lowest ever level. It also resumed its quantitative easing programme, committing to £450bn (US$620bn) in asset purchases, which was expanded twice more in 2020, reaching a total of £895bn.
Despite a recent uptick in inflation, we do not expect the BoE to raise rates before late 2022. The BoE has expressed a view that inflation stemming from the reopening of the economy is likely to be transitory. A premature tightening would pose significant risks to the debt sustainability of UK corporates that have borrowed heavily during the pandemic and also the UK government.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth The pandemic and ensuing public health measures caused a severe economic contraction in 2020, with real GDP shrinking by 9.8%. The most recent lockdown resulted in a contraction of 1.6% in the first quarter of 2021. A significant bounce-back started in April as restrictions were lifted and government incentives to boost investment kicked in. We expect growth of 5.7% in 2021 as a whole. We forecast further catch-up growth of 5.6% in 2022, which looks set to be the first full year without social distancing restrictions; real GDP should return to its pre-crisis level during the first half of 2022. Most of the headline growth will stem from favourable year-on-year comparisons with the 2020-21 lockdowns as shut-down activities restart, rather than from robust new economic activity. The drawdown of household savings, which reached nearly 20% of income in 2020, will contribute to growth significantly. That said, in 2017-19 household savings reached historic lows of less than 7%, owing to Brexit uncertainty and slow wage growth, and we do not expect savings to return to those levels, limiting the increase in overall consumption. In 2023-25 we expect the rate of economic expansion to slow, averaging 1.8% per year, as taxes rise and catch-up growth abates.
Unemployment rose in 2020, as the pandemic caused prolonged business closures. The spike in unemployment was modest, however, at an average rate of 4.5% in 2020, owing to the government's furlough scheme. We expect the rate to average 5.3% in 2021 as the scheme is withdrawn. Unemployment will decline thereafter, reaching 4% in 2024-25.
Gross capital formation declined sharply in 2020 as the uncertain environment depressed investment. We expect a significant bounce-back in investment growth in 2021-22, driven in part by the government's investment tax super-deduction, as well as a more stable post-pandemic and post-Brexit investment environment. Investment growth should stabilise from 2023 until the end of the forecast period.
Export and import growth turned sharply negative in 2020 as global demand collapsed and coronavirus-related travel restrictions persisted. We expect growth to bounce back in 2021-22, but Brexit-related disruption will restrict the pace of expansion.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation Inflation declined sharply in 2020, to an average of only 1%, as the pandemic depressed demand. Prices have begun to rebound sharply in 2021, owing to increased consumer spending, as well as supply constraints both in the domestic market and internationally, which we expect to drive up inflation to an average of 3.1% in 2021 and 2.6% in 2022. From 2023 inflation will decline to a more modest level as pent-up demand is exhausted, stabilising at 1.8% by 2025.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates The value of sterling has been volatile in recent years owing to political uncertainty related to Brexit and the pandemic, as well as the UK's large current-account deficit, which requires significant international capital invest-ment to support the currency. Sterling strengthened against the US dollar in late 2020 and early 2021 as the uncertainty around a potential no-deal Brexit ended and a flight to safety in dollar liquidity gradually unwound, with sterling peaking at US$1.42:£1 in June 2021 before stabilising slightly below that level. Sterling similarly appreciated against the euro in 2021 as Brexit uncertainty dissipated and the UK economy unlocked more rapidly.
Sterling should continue to appreciate against the euro, rising from EUR1.08:£1 at end-2020 to EUR1.19:£1 by end-2021. We expect it to stabilise against the euro from 2022, averaging EUR1:21:£1 in 2022-25; both currencies will appreciate modestly against the dollar during this period as demand for the safe-haven currency decreases, with sterling reaching US$1.46:£1 by end-2025.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector The coronavirus outbreak caused a sharp fall in global trade as demand declined, travel was disrupted and global supply chains were compromised by national lockdowns. The UK was not exempt from this, with both imports and exports declining sharply in 2020. From 2021 we expect trade to rebound, although this will primarily be the result of a recovery from the 2020 base year, and we expect Brexit to weigh on exports (as well as imports, but to a lesser extent). Most catch-up growth in trade, particularly in exports, will be likely to take place in 2022 as global markets fully unlock and UK firms become more experienced in exporting under new trading rules. The UK has run a persistent current-account deficit since 1985. We expect the deficit to widen from 3.5% of GDP in 2020 to 4.5% of GDP in 2021 as the export sector is weakened by worse terms of trade with the EU, before stabilising thereafter.

Full text: - The president, Guillermo Lasso of the centre-right Creando Oportunidades (Creo) party, who took office on May 24th, will face a series of policy challenges over his four-year term that are likely to undermine political stability and engender public and political opposition to his government. Initially he will enjoy a period of public support as his government ramps up the rollout of coronavirus vaccines, which will limit political instability However, as his government endeavours to stabilise the public finances, improve the business environment and attract private investment, political and public pushback are likely; the government has a small minority in the unicameral National Assembly, which is dominated by left-of-centre parties. Passing unpopular measures under the auspices of the IMF will also prove difficult for the Lasso administration. Unilateral or poorly communicated measures risk sapping public support for the government and elevating risks of social unrest. Similarly, any sharp policy adjustments risk sparking widespread protests that could undermine political stability and cause the government to reverse its policies.

- Significant improvements in the business environment are likely under a more market-friendly government in the 2021-25 forecast period, particularly regarding official policy towards foreign investment and private enterprise. However, the new business-friendly administration's minority position in Congress will tame its ambitions in some areas, hampering the overall pace of improvement. Structural impediments, such as inadequate access to local finance and Ecuador's small market size, will persist and will prove difficult for the government to tackle.

- Ecuador will recover slowly from the coronavirus-induced recession that pummelled its weak economy in 2020. Domestic demand will be hampered by a lack of fiscal stimulus during the pandemic, as the government lacked the resources to support consumers and businesses. The new government will continue efforts to consolidate the public finances, but the public debt burden will remain high. Dollarisation provides a basis for macroeconomic stability and will help to keep inflation low, but a more robust economic trajectory is unlikely without a significant increase in private-sector investment.

Population growth   1.5 1.2

Labour force growth   1.5 1.8

- A falling birth rate is contributing to slower population growth, but at an average rate of 1.2% per year in 2021-25, Ecuador's population growth will be on a par with that of its Andean neighbours. In this period the growth of the labour force will exceed that of the country's overall population and the labour force growth of more advanced countries, giving rise to a demographic dividend that could help it to converge with more developed economies in the region.

- Ecuador is one of the smallest markets in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings. We expect the domestic market to grow sluggishly after the pandemic-induced recession of 2020. Significant mineral reserves and efforts to improve the investment environment will attract oil and mining investors, but opportunities outside these sectors will continue to be restricted by low purchasing power measured in terms of GDP per head. Persistent income inequality and poverty will hinder robust growth in household consumption.

- Low levels of productivity and a wealth of natural resources offer scope for Ecuador to catch up with more developed countries, provided that policies are implemented to transform its resource wealth into productive investment in other sectors. Ecuador will benefit from dollarisation and incremental improvements to the business environment. However, poor prospects for significant improvements to institutions do not bode well for a more stable economic policy direction. Assuming persistent structural deficiencies and impediments to governability, as well as inconsistent policymaking decisions, we forecast that long-term investment will be lacking and that income levels will continue to trail OECD levels in the long term.

Background: Ecuador restored its presidential democracy in 1979, but its institutions remain fragile. External economic shocks have contributed to the ousting of three presidents by popular protest since 1997. The former president, Lenín Moreno (2017-21), succeeded Rafael Correa (2007-17)-the longest-serving president in Ecuadorean history. In February 2018 a series of constitutional reforms introduced by Mr Moreno (including the reintroduction of a two-term limit for the presidency) were approved by referendum. Although this was a step towards deeper democratisation, social and fiscal challenges will continue to persist under the government of Guillermo Lasso, who took office as president in May 2021.
Political structure: The 2008 constitution increased executive power, but has done little to foster institutional capacity to tackle problems such as a politicised judiciary, powerful business lobbies, and mobilised grassroots and indigenous groups. Although the constitution affords the executive the power to fast-track economic legislation, a fragmented political landscape and the latent threat of sweeping protests severely hinder governability.
Policy issues: Dollarisation has provided macroeconomic stability but exposed Ecuador's underlying lack of competitiveness. Modest oil prices anticipated in the 2021-25 forecast period (relative to the previous decade) have necessitated fiscal adjustments. The Moreno administration secured a three-year IMF agreement-along with other multilateral financing-in March 2019 to meet objectives including putting the public finances on a sustainable trajectory, enhancing national competitiveness and protecting dollarisation. However, the programme was abandoned at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and was succeeded by a new IMF lending programme that aims to achieve many of the same goals.
Taxation: Taxes have been subject to frequent changes. The main taxes in Ecuador are income tax, levied at rates of up to 35%, and value-added tax (VAT), levied at 12%. Private firms must distribute 15% of their profits among their employees.
Foreign trade: Ecuador recorded a trade surplus of US$3.3bn in 2020; petrol export earnings averaged 26% of total export revenue, compared with over 50% during the commodity boom in the 2000s.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Ecuador has a multiparty democracy. The president, Guillermo Lasso of the centre-right Creando Oportunidades (Creo), took office in May for a four-year term after winning a run-off election against Andrés Arauz, a left-wing populist protégé of a former president, Rafael Correa (2007-17). No party achieved a majority in the 2021 elections, and Mr Lasso governs with a minority in the unicameral 137-seat National Assembly that is dominated by left-of-centre parties. The largest bloc in the legislature is controlled by the leftist Unión por la Esperanza (UNES), which is the continuation of Mr Correa's political movement; his original electoral vehicle, Alianza País (AP), split in 2018 following a power clash with his presidential successor, Lenín Moreno (2017-21) and won no seats in the current legislature. The second-largest bloc consists of the indigenous Movimiento de Unidad Plurinacional Pachakutik (Pachakutik), which secured its greatest-ever legislative representation in the 2021 elections, and the social-democratic Izquierda Democrática (ID). The conservative Partido Social Cristiano (PSC) joined with Creo to support Mr Lasso's ticket, but they did not formalise a governing coalition. The legislative landscape can be fluid, with legislators sometimes switching allegiances.

Political outlook: Political stability Mr Lasso starts his term in a surprisingly strong position: his high 71.4% approval rating at the beginning of his presidency contrasts sharply with the low 9.3% rating of his predecessor, Lenín Moreno, on leaving office. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the new government to achieve some success in ramping up the rollout of coronavirus vaccines and paving the way for economic normalisation, but the momentum and support that it currently enjoys will be dampened eventually by its weak legislative position and considerable policy challenges.
Governability will be complicated by the need to build consensus across a divided political landscape. Creo holds only 12 seats in the 137-seat National Assembly, which is dominated by left-of-centre parties that control more than 90 seats. The only other major conservative party is the PSC, which has 17 seats. Although an electoral alliance between Creo and the PSC did not translate into a legislative alliance, the PSC is unlikely to be hostile to Mr Lasso's agenda. The new president can also count on 13 legislators outside of Creo and the PSC who have aligned themselves with the government, but he will still have to garner legislative support from ideological opponents such as the alliance of the indigenous Pachakutik party and the centre-left ID, which hold 27 and 18 seats respectively. This implies that he will have to make concessions to these parties to facilitate policymaking, especially as Pachakutik controls the presidency of the National Assembly. Achieving cross-party support from the largest opposition movement, the left-wing UNES which has 49 seats, is unlikely.
Without a legislative majority, Mr Lasso will depend on ad hoc support from other parties to pass key legislation. Even if Creo successfully forms a working majority with other parties at some point, the alliance would have a short shelf-life; Ecuador has little experience with political coalitions, and many voters are suspicious that these kinds of accords will be accompanied by corruption. Furthermore, a diverse coalition would involve parties that have opposing views on tax policy, labour market regulations, social policies, oil and mining permits, the size of the state wage bill, and various other issues. We assume that Mr Lasso will make some policy concessions, but perhaps not enough to secure the long-term viability of any potential governing alliance. Managing the varying demands of diverse parties with a weak legislative position will put additional strain on the government (on top of the economic challenges posed by Covid-19 and limited fiscal space), ultimately risking what little governability can be achieved through ad hoc, cross-party support.
Mr Lasso will have executive tools at his disposal to advance his agenda unilaterally, but the risk of a political and social backlash is likely to limit his ambitions. He will be able to submit bills that eliminate taxes, set trade tariff levels, modify credit and financial policies, and sell or establish concessions for state-owned companies. Mr Lasso is likely to take advantage of the executive powers at his disposal, but he will have to balance his agenda with the public's expectations, given the risk of public and political backlash against policies that are unpopular or badly communicated. Notably, these pressures prevented Mr Lasso from introducing a tax reform on the day that he took office, as he had intended. Just as social unrest forced Mr Moreno to backtrack on changes to the country's fuel subsidy regime in 2019, any sharp policy adjustments will risk social unrest, especially bearing in mind that Mr Lasso garnered just 20% of the vote in the first round of the presidential election and clearly does not have firm public support. All of this affords Mr Lasso little room for manoeuvre on policy. However, given the challenging economic and health backdrop, we believe that there will be a latent risk of social unrest-even in the absence of sharp policy adjustments-throughout Mr Lasso's term in office.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Politicised institutions, an inefficient bureaucracy, a complex and archaic tax system, and corruption have long undermined institutional effectiveness. Although constitutional amendments in 2008 and 2015 under Mr Correa tilted discretional power in the executive's favour, this did little to improve political effectiveness and also reduced accountability. Political effectiveness continues to be hampered by the fragmented political party system and various groups' ability to effectively veto government policies: since Ecuador became a presidential democracy in 1979, this has manifested itself several times in the form of sweeping protests and coup d'états. Barring a period of relative political stability under Mr Correa (and another brief one under Mr Moreno), no president has had a single-party majority in the legislature, which has weighed on governability. Securing cross-party support has proven difficult, and the country has little experience with political coalitions, as many voters are suspicious that these kinds of accords will be accompanied by corruption.
The Moreno administration made moderate progress in addressing institutional weaknesses. A referendum in 2018 enabled him to restructure the judicial appointment process, introduce term limits for the executive, enact stricter penalties for corruption, move to rationalise real-estate taxation and introduce market-friendly regulations regarding mining investment. Challenges to greater political and institutional effectiveness remain, however; there are bureaucratic inefficiencies, governability is weak, lawmaking is subject to the demands of an array of vested interests, and law enforcement is inadequate. These obstacles are compounded by risks of social unrest. Social groups have the ability to effectively reverse or block implementation of government policy, as demonstrated by indigenous groups' ousting of three presidents prior to Mr Correa's presidency and by widespread unrest in October 2019 that forced the government to operate briefly outside the capital and to reverse its elimination of fuel subsidies.
Deep-rooted institutional shortcomings will remain a hindrance Reforms are required to bolster the intregity of the legal system. The Moreno administration attempted to stop political interference by the judiciary and curb graft, but results have been mixed. Mr Moreno successfully installed a new panel of judges in the Constitutional Court after the previous court was terminated amid a cloud of allegations of wrongdoing; investigations into alleged malfeasance (including money-laundering and other financial crimes) intensified the court's already poor reputational standing stemming from perceptions of favouritism towards the political leadership. Nonetheless, inefficiency and corruption remain deeply rooted in the judicial system. The Council of the Judiciary has shown little progress in handling corruption cases, access to legal protection and law enforcement remains flawed, and effective protection of rights is still lacking.
We expect the Lasso administration to make piecemeal progress in bolstering institutions' capacity to tackle corruption, but significant improvements are unlikely. Anti-corruption initiatives have yielded few tangible results, and some efforts by Mr Moreno were politically complicated given his unpopular position and lack of a majority in the legislature; Mr Lasso will operate with an even smaller legislative presence, hampering any efforts to advance anti-corruption legislation that may be deemed controversial by the opposition. The misuse of funds in public institutions and networks of corruption within the state will be exceedingly difficult to root out.
Political outlook: Election watch Mr Lasso defeated Mr Arauz in the second-round presidential run-off on April 11th. His victory was not a ringing endorsement of him as a conservative candidate, but rather a rejection of the politics and governance style of Mr Arauz's political mentor, Mr Correa, who was president in 2007-17. Indeed, Mr Lasso was helped to the presidency because much of the political spectrum lent him their support to prevent a return of correísmo.
Trends that were evident in the election will remain significant and will influence the public's view of Mr Lasso's government. Specifically, voters want action on environmental protection and human rights (particularly for women), are wary of a government that quashes dissent and attacks its opposition (as Mr Correa's government did), and are not content with the status quo (null votes accounted for 16% of those cast in the second round, more than double the figure in the 2017 run-off election).
Political outlook: International relations Promoting international trade and foreign investment will be among Mr Lasso's policy priorities. In the early days of his administration, Mr Lasso will target a reduction in bureaucratic procedures and a simplification of regulations for exporters, while strengthening ties with commercial partners. We expect that his administration will seek to advance discussions with the US on a free-trade agreement (FTA) and pursue Ecuador's accession to the Pacific Alliance (a regional trade bloc), in addition to seeking agreements with other export markets. As a market-oriented president, Mr Lasso will also bolster ties with multilateral institutions and renegotiate Ecuador's debt with China. Following a deal with the US Development Finance Corporation that will be used to buy back a large chunk of Ecuador's US$5.2bn in Chinese debt, Mr Lasso is likely to maintain the Moreno government's fairly cool diplomatic relations with China. Diplomatic relations with left-leaning regional governments are unlikely to improve under the Lasso administration.

Ecuador scores poorly in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings for the historical period (2016-20). This reflects the populist policy stance of a former president, Rafael Correa (2007-17), which deterred foreign investment. His successor, Lenín Moreno (2017-21), took a different approach, but changes were only gradual, which explains why the results for the historical period are still weak. Ecuador's score improves markedly in the 2021-25 forecast period, reflecting the impact of changes that Mr Moreno introduced towards the end of his tenure, as well as the explicitly market-friendly stance of the new president, Guillermo Lasso, who took office in May. Cognisant of the dire state of the public finances, Mr Lasso will seek to attract foreign investment as a way of engineering an economic recovery from the recession induced by the coronavirus pandemic, lifting exports and creating jobs. He will also place more emphasis on improving relations with Ecuador's main trading partners through free-trade agreements (FTAs).
New government embraces orthodox economic policymaking In view of these developments, the areas in which Ecuador's business environ-ment improves the most are mostly linked to government policy. The country's global ranking rises sharply for policy towards private enterprise and competition, foreign investment and taxes. Its score for the macroeconomic environment is set to improve only slightly, but its comparative rankings will soar. This reflects the authorities' limited scope for large-scale pandemic-related stimulus last year owing to already pressing debt concerns, which meant that the public finances did not deteriorate as much as in other countries.
This is a positive picture, but there is an unusually high level of uncertainty attached to our forecasts for the business environment, because it remains unclear how much of Mr Lasso's policy agenda will materialise. His centre-right, market-friendly stance is at odds with a significant share of Congress, where he lacks a majority. Our baseline forecast is that Mr Lasso will tread carefully to avoid stoking social unrest, pressing ahead with reforms to improve the business environment and attract investment, but doing so gradually in order to form a consensus behind his proposals. We believe that some progress will be made, but that political necessities will force him to withdraw any measures that the left-wing majority deems unacceptable. Given Ecuador's chequered political history, it is possible that the opposition could block the new president's proposals altogether, which would prompt a significant downgrade to our business environment forecasts.

Business environment outlook: Ecuador's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Fuel subsidies are gradually lifted. Implementation of antitrust policies is subject to politicisation. Select industries (such as mining) benefit from policies promoting supply-side growth.
2023-25: Government continues to scale back state's role in development. Nonetheless, regulation and licensing continue to favour state-run companies over private-sector firms. New public-private partnership model is trialled.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Government makes overtures to foreign firms and passes pro-business reforms in a bid to lift inward investment.
2023-25: Property rights protection improves. Investor concerns about access to foreign arbitration ease.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Capital outflows tax begins to be scaled back. Efforts to pursue free-trade agreements (FTAs) accelerate as new government seeks to start talks with major commercial partners.
2023-25: Supply-side reforms enhance national competitiveness. Government lifts capital outflows tax altogether.
Taxes 2021-22: New administration implements measures to expand tax base and improve collection. Certain exemptions are eliminated, and other burdensome regulations are simplified.

Ecuador's score for the macroeconomic environment category-the strongest area of its business environment by some distance-increases in the forecast period, and both its global ranking and regional ranking improve sharply. This may seem unusual given that the country has defaulted on its external debt a number of times (most recently in 2020), but the assessment for the macroeconomic environment is weighted towards underlying fundamentals, for which Ecuador scores comparatively well. Dollarisation keeps inflation low, reduces the risk of periods of sharp currency volatility and reduces (but does not eliminate) the risk of a balance-of-payments crisis. Although the public finances have been a weaker area for some time, financing difficulties prevented the budget deficit from swelling in 2020 (as happened in many other economies). For these governments, the 2021-25 forecast period will be a time of only gradual fiscal retrenchment, and the average budget deficit will be significantly wider than in 2016-20; in contrast, Ecuador's public finances will register a small surplus on average in 2021-25 (making it one of just a handful in the countries in the world where that will be the case). Although public debt has risen in recent years, an improvement in the budget balance will facilitate an easing of the public debt burden over the medium term. Ongoing IMF support is likely to support this process.

- The downside effect of near-term fiscal consolidation will be that GDP recovers more gradually than in other economies, where large-scale stimulus will facilitate a speedier rebound. We expect real GDP to return to pre-pandemic levels only in 2024, which is late by regional and global comparison. Average oil prices will be moderately higher in 2021-25 than in 2016-20 (West Texas Intermediate, a proxy for Ecuadorean oil export prices, is set to average US$63.1/barrel in the forecast period, compared with US$51.1/b in the historical period), but average production levels are likely to be broadly similar. A quicker economic recovery would require higher sustainable rates of growth in non-oil sectors. In turn, this would require greater legal stability and improvements in the regulatory environment, as well as expanded access to foreign markets. Although there will be progress in many of these areas in 2021-25, it will take time for these improvements to filter through to the path of GDP growth.

Ecuador's score and ranking for policy towards private enterprise and competition improve in the 2021-25 forecast period. Our baseline forecast is that, under Mr Lasso, there will be greater private-sector participation in some regulated sectors of the economy, including infrastructure and mining. Nonetheless, a full reversal of state ownership is unlikely, as is a deeper liberalisation of policy towards private enterprise and competition, as Mr Lasso's minority position in Congress will prevent a sharp shift in policy. As a result, monopolies and oligopolies will remain features of Ecuador's business environment, particularly in certain sectors (such as the cement, financial, supermarket and steel industries). Some improvements in efficiency are likely, but high levels of bureaucracy will constrain private investment and competition in 2021-25.
Government continues with gradual withdrawal of fuel subsidies
- Certain goods and services-such as electric power, agricultural chemicals, pharmaceuticals and telephone tariffs-are subject to government price controls. Limited price controls for some basic foodstuffs also exist. Government subsidies for fuel have traditionally proven particularly costly. In 2009-19 these placed a substantial strain on the budget, costing an annual average of US$2.3bn (equivalent to about 7% of spending and two-thirds of the overall fiscal deficit). Mr Moreno made notable progress on scaling back these subsidies, but his efforts were not without challenges. In October 2019 Mr Moreno enacted a sharp and abrupt eradication of fuel subsidies by executive decree. The move triggered intense social unrest in Quito (the capital), forcing the administration to withdraw the reform after just ten days. However, several months later the government revisited efforts to reduce fuel subsidies, and a new regime took effect in July. The authorities now set retail petrol prices monthly, with retailers allowed to sell fuel within 3-5% of this fixed rate. The rate is determined by global prices and has reduced the burden of subsidies on state finances. The gradual reform aims to align retail petrol prices with market prices by the end of 2021, when fuel subsidies will be eliminated altogether. Mr Lasso has indicated that he will keep this system in place. In order to address any public discontent related to the transition, the government plans to use the fiscal savings to expand coverage of social assistance programmes for poor families.

Stance towards private sector will be warmer under Mr Lasso
- Mr Lasso's policy stance is likely to be more welcoming towards private-sector participation in some state companies than was the case under previous administrations. In late May Mr Lasso stated that he was seeking to auction concessions for three refinery projects and a number of new highways. He is also seeking a private-sector concession partner to operate the Corporación Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (CNT, the state telephone company), and the full privatisation of Banco del Pacífico (a state bank) is also under discussion. Although Mr Lasso's more openly pro-market stance makes the policy environment more supportive in this area, we believe that progress will be slow. Mr Moreno pursued similar plans regarding the CNT, and the privatisation of other state assets, including Banco del Pacífico, was also floated in recent years. However, these plans never came to fruition owing to public opposition and weak investor demand (reflecting mismanagement of state-run companies in recent years and a lack of fully audited accounts, which complicates estimates of market value). These factors will hamper Mr Lasso's scope for action.
- The previous government pushed for all major infrastructure projects to be developed with private-sector investment, primarily using public-private partnership (PPP) agreements. However, the uptake of PPPs was weak, partly because of shaky investor confidence related to legal insecurity and partly because of a lack of staff with the necessary resources to promote and support PPP development. Mr Lasso is seeking to lift inward investment via the PPP framework by appointing a special committee tasked with setting out a project pipeline and identifying potential sources of investment partners. A planned reform to the PPP legal framework should speed up the negotiation and approval of projects. The current PPP legislative framework is based on the Regulations for the Public-Private Partnership Regime, the Law of Incentives for PPPs and Foreign Investment, and the General Regulations for the Application of the Framework Law of Incentives for PPPs and Foreign Investment. These were all introduced in 2015-16 and essentially consist of tax breaks-including breaks from import tariffs and value-added tax (VAT) during project construction-as well as a ten-year reprieve from income tax and a reprieve from tax on the repatriation of profits.

Vested interests will resist government efforts to lift foreign investment Ecuador's score for policy towards foreign investment improves firmly in the 2021-25 period, and its position in the global ranking rises from 72nd to 56th. The Moreno government was more willing to engage with foreign investors than its predecessor, which is an approach that will continue (and accelerate) under the newly inaugurated Lasso administration. Broadly speaking, government commitment to crafting policy that gives foreign investors transparency, clarity and predictability will be stronger in 2021-25 than in 2016-20. Despite this expected improvement, policy towards foreign investment remains a relatively low-scoring area for Ecuador. Securing legislative support for deeper structural reforms to improve the country's competitiveness is unlikely given probable opposition from the public and the left-leaning legislature. Powerful domestic vested interests will continue to resist some of the government's reform efforts.

- The state's considerable role in the economy-combined with a preference for domestic over foreign investment and frequent changes to laws-fostered general uncertainty regarding the security of foreign investments and contractual agreements, particularly under Mr Correa. Under Mr Moreno, the promotion of foreign investment became more noticeable, driven in large part by economic expediency. In 2018 legislation came into force that stipulated that disputes over investment agreements must be resolved through arbitration. Even international arbitral decisions are now deemed immediately enforceable in Ecuador, without the need for further approval by domestic courts. Mr Lasso is likely to continue this trend towards assuring a more stable foreign-investment environment and will seek to reassure investors (who are generally still jittery) about judicial security. However, given that foreign investors are often looking for long-term security about the official policy stance, radical shifts in administration in recent years will remain a cause for concern. Even if policy towards foreign investment is more welcoming under Mr Lasso, there remains a risk of reversal under a future administration.
- The World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) has now concluded all of the legal disputes between foreign companies and the government relating to Mr Correa's tenure; some of the proceedings had dragged on for many years, and some cases have only recently been settled. In early June the government confirmed that it would pay Perenco (a British-French oil company) US$374m after the ICSID upheld its ruling on the award in late May. Less than a month into his presidency, Mr Lasso returned Ecuador to the ICSID (Mr Correa withdrew the country in 2010), signalling a shift in the government's willingness to improve the investment environment.

Ecuador's underlying score rises moderately in the forecast period, along with its global and regional rankings. Mr Lasso will boost efforts to diversify export markets, join the Pacific Alliance (an integration project that includes Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico) and pursue efforts to sign free-trade agreements (FTAs) with Ecuador's main trading partners in North America, Europe and Latin America. Sporadic trade spats with regional partners will be less likely than previously. Trade policies will be open over the forecast period, and we do not expect import and capital-account restrictions to be implemented.
Relations with the US will improve further under Mr Lasso
- Ecuador's trade relationship with the US (its biggest export partner) will continue to improve under Mr Lasso, after Mr Moreno rekindled ties with that country. The weak score in the 2016-20 historical period partly reflects Ecuador's unilateral decision in 2013 to withdraw from the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA), which granted tariff-free access to the US market for about 6,000 goods. The government failed to secure an alternative trade agreement, forcing many non-traditional sectors (such as cut flowers, fruit and vegetables) to lose competitiveness against other Latin American countries that maintained FTAs with the US. Bilateral ties improved under Mr Moreno, culminating in the signing of an agreement in December 2020 that should lay the groundwork for an eventual FTA between the two countries. The agreement includes provisions to align regulatory oversight, harmonise customs procedures and boost bilateral trade between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Mr Lasso is keen to begin negotiations on an FTA, but talks are likely to take some time, as each side and then both sides will need to reach a consensus over thorny issues including market access for agricultural goods, labour standards and environmental policy. Our baseline forecast is that Ecuador will sign an FTA with the US, but later on in the outlook period, with the benefits only felt in the longer term.
- There has been some progress in streamlining customs procedures in order to improve efficiency in recent years, although corruption and drug smuggling via overseas shipments remain a problem. A number of electronic procedures and automation processes have helped to speed up the delivery of goods. Given that tackling corruption is a major focus of both the IMF and the US, Mr Lasso is likely to continue efforts to crack down on corruption, both in terms of public procurement and trade-related embezzlement. In the past frequent changes to customs duties have acted as a major disincentive for legitimate businesses and fuelled contraband trade; there is likely to be a greater focus on stabilising the customs framework in 2021-25.
- The Impuesto a la Salida de Divisas (ISD, a 5% tax on capital outflows) applies to all non-cash, hard-currency transactions of repatriated capital and transfers from banks to external accounts exceeding US$5,000. The Moreno government indicated plans to phase out the tax, but the deterioration of the economy in 2020 halted progress. Mr Lasso has stated that he plans to reduce the ISD gradually over his tenure, eliminating it altogether by the time of the next presidential election, in 2025.

Ecuador's score and ranking for taxation improve in the forecast period. In the historical period official tax policy stance was volatile and prone to abrupt changes in legislation to meet short-term financing needs. This fuelled uncertainty and was a major impediment to investment. However, this began to change under the auspices of the Fund, and the Moreno administration passed a tax reform-albeit a watered-down one-in December 2019. The reform was designed to raise revenue, mainly through a 0.2% increase in the income tax rate of companies with annual revenue above US$50m, and through the introduction of income tax on dividends distributed by resident companies to non-resident businesses or individuals. As part of the IMF agreement, Mr Lasso will prioritise efforts to strengthen the tax system, including boosting the powers of the tax administration to combat widespread evasion and abuse of tax avoidance schemes. Over time the Servicio de Rentas Internas (the tax authority) is likely to establish a better reputation in terms of efficiency.
New government will resist IMF calls to raise VAT rate
- At 12%, the VAT rate is more than 5 percentage points below the average rate in South America and 3 percentage points below the average in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Fund has recommended increasing the rate, but Mr Lasso will resist these calls, preferring to try to raise tax collection by cracking down on evasion and widening the tax base. It is even possible that the VAT rate will be cut four times per year for a limited period in order to stimulate retail sales. The Fund is likely to adopt a wait-and-see approach, particularly as higher VAT rates could stoke social unrest (thereby undermining Mr Lasso's political position and potentially jeopardising other policy measures). However, if the new government's efforts to increase revenue collection fail, the Fund could press more forcefully for a hike in rates. There may be other changes to personal income taxes and consumption taxes (including reductions in personal allowances and deductions) in order to lift the tax take later in the forecast period.

Ecuador's score for financing in 2021-25 improves noticeably (from a low base), but as similarly ranked countries will also make improvements, its global rank improves more modestly. State intervention in the banking sector was a feature of the business environment in the past but is unlikely to pose a significant risk in 2021-25. Mr Lasso-himself a former banker-will engender greater confidence among commercial banks and their customers, with deposit and credit growth picking up, albeit from a low level. However, many structural problems will continue to complicate corporate access to finance. The banking sector remains underdeveloped compared with the size of the economy; financial services are relatively rudimentary, with a small secondary market and two stock exchanges (in Quito, the capital, and Guayaquil) vying with each other for a limited pool of bond and equity issuances. In this context, financing is-and will remain-dominated by bank loans, with only large companies able to secure the lowest rates, of about 7%. Smaller companies face rates upwards of 12%, with loan maturities often capped at three years. Long-term bank finance and capital market finance remain underdeveloped and difficult to secure.

- An expected weak recovery from the sharp recession in 2020 poses risks to the financial sector that could affect companies' ability to access credit. Financial soundness indicators remain reasonable, but profit ratios are still low (although they have begun to recover), meaning that firms could find it more difficult (or costly) to borrow if banks become more cautious about lending. This risk would be elevated if banks were to experience a run on deposits (the vast majority of which are still held in instant-access accounts). However, assuming an economic recovery, this is unlikely to materialise.
- Confidence in the banking system is tied to the management of reserve requirements at the Banco Central del Ecuador (the central bank), which is central to sustaining dollarisation but has been the target of regulatory changes in the past. However, recent legislation to strengthen the central bank's authority will reduce the risk of more aggressive executive controls on bank deposits (which would weaken commercial bank lending and undermine market confidence more broadly). The recent legislation strengthens central bank autonomy by closing a loophole allowing the funding of the government and by restoring a four-system balance-sheet structure (eliminated in 2008) that facilitates transparency.

Business environment outlook: The labour market

Despite some improvement in the underlying score and rankings for 2021-25, Ecuador's labour market will remain one of the weakest areas of its business environment. An increase in spending on education and training programmes during the oil boom years failed to raise skills levels or productivity, with lower oil prices necessitating subsequent cutbacks. Skills shortages and mismatches remain a problem, compounded by a lack of effective training programmes in both the public and private sector. Recent moves to increase flexibility in labour market regulation are a positive sign, as is Mr Lasso's focus on improving the quality of education provision, but the need for fiscal adjustment will cap public investment in these areas, meaning that long-running and structural problems (such as skills shortages) are likely to persist. Access to social security has improved for some sectors of the population, but the labour market remains highly informal, which will be difficult to tackle. Mr Lasso hopes that increased private-sector investment will boost formal job creation, but we do not expect investment to rise enough to have a meaningful impact on reducing labour market informality until towards the end of the forecast period (if at all). In comparative terms, labour costs will edge down slightly in 2021-25 but will remain high, particularly relative to productivity.

- The Moreno government sought to table a reform bill to increase labour market flexibility and promote job creation, but its plans were pushed back as negotiations between the authorities and unions and pressure groups dragged on. However, the government incorporated most of the planned changes into a broader "humanitarian support" law that was passed by emergency decree in May 2020 in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The changes make it easier to renegotiate labour contracts between employers and employees. Both sides can agree to salary reductions to avoid lay-offs and can negotiate changes in the number of working hours (and how these are spread, allowing employees more flexibility), with social security obligations and benefits adjusted accordingly. The initial limit for this flexibility in contracts is two years, but contracts can be renewed annually for two more years.

Mild US dollar depreciation will not boost competitiveness much
- The strength of the US dollar will compound competitiveness problems in the short term (Ecuador's minimum wage is among the highest in Latin America in dollar terms, although its productivity lags that of most of its neighbours). We expect that some mild depreciation of the US dollar during 2021-25 will be insufficient to boost competitiveness significantly.

Raising educational outcomes will be a slow and difficult process
- The new president is seeking to expand access to education (by reopening 900 schools that were shut in rural areas in 2013-16), improve the quality of education provision (by increasing training opportunities), and boost digital skills (by investing in computer equipment). He is also planning to reform the admissions system for higher education to make the process more equitable and to give universities more autonomy. However, efforts to improve education will progress only slowly, owing to the government's difficult fiscal position, which will preclude any significant increase in public spending. Structural problems in the education system will be difficult to rectify. Although net secondary school enrolment has risen in recent years, student results still trail those of other countries in the region. Raising standards will require a sustained and long-term commitment from the government; even assuming that the quality of education policies improves, student results are unlikely to pick up until the end of our 2021-25 forecast period.

Business environment outlook: Infrastructure                
Value of index a   Global rank b   Regional rank c  
2016-20 2021-25 2016-20 2021-25 2016-20 2021-25

a Out of 10. b Out of 82 countries. c  Out of 12 countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.
Infrastructure was one of the stronger areas of Ecuador's business environment in the historical period. Although some improvements in 2021-25 are likely, these will be moderate (reflecting fiscal constraints), so Ecuador's global ranking improves only marginally, and faster progress by other Latin American countries pushes Ecuador's regional ranking down slightly. A large public investment programme put in place by Mr Correa means that, following decades of underinvestment (and frequent electricity shortages), the quality of transport, energy and road infrastructure is now comparable with the Latin American median, and telecoms development (measured by mobile and internet penetration) is above the regional average. However, given the need for fiscal consolidation, government efforts to modernise infrastructure will be reined in. The authorities will seek to attract private investment for infra-structure projects, but Ecuador lacks the solid track record of fostering successful PPPs that have helped to upgrade infrastructure in other countries in the region. Some progress is likely, but it will not lead to a material improvement in this area of the business environment.

- A major focus of infrastructure investment has been the development of new hydroelectric power plants to avoid importing costly energy for gas-fired and thermoelectric plants. In the medium term, there is potential to expand energy exports. However, there are valid concerns that hydroelectric plants will fail to reach expected generation levels owing to design issues, potentially misleading estimates about power generation and debt service, which could lead to supply bottlenecks and the need to import electricity.
- Recent investment has led to road infrastructure improvements and the creation of new road networks. This should help to boost domestic and intraregional trade, but it will also create challenges including congestion, as advances in traffic management have been more limited. Moreover, seasonal heavy rains that are costly and difficult to mitigate continue to cause seasonal disruption in some areas. There has been much slower progress on developing mass transport systems to relieve urban congestion, including an underground rail system in Quito that began construction in 2012 but has been repeatedly delayed (and is now likely to open in 2022) and a tram project in Cuenca (the third-largest city), which was delayed but finally began operating in mid-2020.

Although Ecuador's score for technological readiness increases in 2021-25, it does so only marginally, and its global and regional rankings remain weak. Its global ranking of 74th makes this area the weakest of the business environ-ment, reflecting low smartphone penetration and a lack of spending on research and innovation, which undermine the overall score. However, Ecuador scores relatively well for preparedness for e-commerce and cyber-security.
Internet access and penetration will improve over the forecast period
- The Lasso administration will seek to accelerate efforts to expand the telecoms and information technology sectors. Internet access through mobile phones will drive wider mobile-phone usage during the outlook period as handsets and data tariffs become more affordable and mobile phones are used increasingly in place of personal computers (PCs). We expect data services to be the fastest-growing segment of the mobile market. However, coverage remains inadequate and costs are high, limiting access. Despite efforts to improve competition in the mobile market, a complicated regulatory environment for foreign companies will remain impediments. Internet penetration, particularly of broadband, has been limited, but we expect it to grow over the forecast period as technology becomes more widely available and connectivity improves. The number of overall internet subscriptions will continue to grow.
- The expansion of 4G technology has been relatively slow, even by regional standards. The Correa government imposed high costs on new contracts for mobile-telephony firms in 2008, which slowed rollout as companies worked to recover costs. Smartphone adoption was relatively late, reflecting low income levels and high tariffs on imported handsets (classified as luxury goods under Mr Correa). In July 2019 the Moreno government launched its Ecuador Digital programme, which aimed to increase penetration indicators (particularly in rural areas), improve internet speeds, expand 4G broadband and accelerate the allocation of new telecoms bandwidth, with a view to beginning 5G testing. The Lasso government will continue these efforts, offering incentives for the private sector to boost 4G coverage more rapidly. It is likely to roll out a spectrum allocation plan, with a view to auctioning 5G bands.

E-commerce will grow owing to rising internal penetration and Covid-19
- Rising internet penetration and smartphone usage will foster growth in online retail, albeit from a low base. According to the Cámara Ecuatoriana de Comercio Electrónico (CECE, the e-commerce chamber), e-commerce generated US$2.3bn in sales in 2020, up by about 44% year on year, as coronavirus-related shop closures saw demand for e-commerce soar. In 2021 CECE anticipates sales growth of at least 10% as more people become regular e-commerce customers.

Economic forecast: Policy trends The government, led by Guillermo Lasso, will pursue an orthodox macroeconomic policy agenda. However quickly the new president would like to address the structural shortcomings in Ecuador's business and investment environment, he will first need to make tangible progress on ramping up the country's Covid-19 vaccination programme. He has set a target of vaccinating 9m people (60% of the population) within his first 100 days of office (by early September). This is likely to prove too optimistic given the delivery and distribution challenges that the outgoing government encountered, but the rollout should still speed up following the procurement of 6m single-dose vaccines produced by Sinovac (China), which will give Mr Lasso's government early momentum. As at June 20th 7% of the population had been fully vaccinated; given that only 6.1% had had one dose as at June 15th, this represents a clear acceleration.
In parallel to his push on the vaccination front, Mr Lasso will pursue his campaign pledges to promote investment and create employment. Initially, he will try to reduce taxes and simplify the tax regime. Over his four-year term he will also seek to reduce trade barriers, ease labour market rigidities, modify financial regulations (partly to attract more international banks) and stabilise the public finances. In 2022 Mr Lasso may well pursue a substantial 25% rise in the minimum wage as part of a campaign pledge. He is also likely to offer oil contracts (using enhanced production-sharing agreements) and state-owned assets through a concessionary programme (including the Esmeraldas oil refinery and the Sacha oilfield) to boost state revenue, as he is not inclined to raise taxes.
The Economist Intelligence Unit's economic forecasts assume that Mr Lasso will achieve only modest success in his policy agenda. Some areas of his agenda that do not require legislative approval (such as lowering trade barriers) stand a good chance of materialising during his term, but we expect the government's weak legislative position to complicate progress on liberalising economic reforms that do require legislative support (such as labour reform). Mr Lasso is likely to exercise his ability to submit fast-track economic legislation (if the National Assembly does not approve or reject a bill submitted as fast-track legislation, the bill goes into effect automatically after 30 days) in an effort to make speedy progress on his agenda. However, given his party's weak position in the National Assembly, the leftist parties that dominate the legislature could amass enough support to reject bills that they deem incompatible with their views. Although ad hoc support garnered through policy concessions is likely to reduce obstacles to some facets of his liberalising agenda, Mr Lasso will still have to tread carefully (and moderate his ambitions) to maintain support from other parties.
The new president's view on tax increases puts him at odds with the IMF's recommendation to the former government to raise the value-added tax (VAT), but he is nonetheless likely to maintain a good relationship with the Fund. He is committed to the overarching objectives of the former government's front-loaded, US$6.5bn, 27-month extended fund facility (EFF) agreement signed in September 2020: putting the public finances on a stable trajectory; improving fiscal transparency; and strengthening the independence of the Banco Central del Ecuador (BCE, the central bank). His economic team is likely to seek a recalibration of how the government shores up the public finances and bolsters dollarisation, but communication has so far been positive. The Fund disbursed US$4bn in October-December 2020 and is likely to disburse another US$800m in the second half of 2021, after legislation to strengthen the autonomy and governance framework of the BCE was approved in April.
Governability challenges will give rise to sustained programme implementation risks, especially owing to the lack of popular support for continued austerity measures. Nonetheless, we anticipate that strong communication between the Lasso government and the Fund-coupled with Mr Lasso's policy objectives-will result in continued multilateral support. We do not expect a subsequent lending arrangement to follow the current EFF programme (which ends in December 2022), but we do not discount the possibility of this occurring, especially in the event of policy slippage.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy Fiscal indicators

Government revenue 30.3 31.4 32.9 33.8 34.4 34.8
Government expenditure 35.9 34.1 33.2 32.8 32.8 33.0
Budget balance -5.6 -2.7 -0.4 1.0 1.6 1.8
Over the course of his four-year term Mr Lasso will work to restore health to the public finances after years of sustained fiscal deficits. The president will be reluctant to raise taxes and will seek to boost fiscal revenue through enhanced collection and concessions of state assets, including refineries and the state-owned telecommunications company.
Notwithstanding substantial implementation risks to the government's EFF programme, we forecast that the non-financial public-sector (NFPS) deficit will narrow to 2.7% of GDP in 2021, from an estimated 5.6% of GDP in 2020. We expect that the reduction will be driven primarily by an increase in revenue, supported by a recovery in economic activity and firmer oil prices. Contained spending-partly due to reduced debt-servicing costs stemming from significant debt relief secured by restructuring of the government's US$17.4bn in bonded external debt in 2020-will also contribute to a narrower deficit. However, despite efforts to reduce the NFPS deficit, public debt as a percentage of GDP will rise from an estimated 63.9% in 2020 to 66.2% in 2021.
Although Mr Lasso is seeking a recalibration of targets with the Fund, our medium-term forecasts assume that the overarching policy objectives and fiscal targets will not change significantly. As such, we assume that the fiscal balance will shift into surplus by 2023 and that the public debt/GDP ratio will fall over the medium term as contained spending and an increase in revenue (on the back of a firmer economic recovery) help the government to achieve primary surpluses.

Deposit rate (av) 6.3 5.5 5.4 5.1 5.0 4.9
As a dollarised economy, Ecuador lacks independent monetary policy and will be unable to generate a strong monetary policy response to support the economic recovery. Monetary conditions will continue to be determined largely by external factors, but real local rates remain elevated-real lending rates will \fall only slightly in 2021 after rising in 2020-partly owing to Ecuador's high risk premium. Against the backdrop of a slow recovery from the pandemic-induced crisis, weak confidence among domestic lenders and tepid inflows of foreign capital will hinder monetary growth. Our forecasts assume policy continuity under the auspices of the Fund, which will reduce the threat of de-dollarisation: Mr Lasso's economic policy agenda is unlikely to undermine the currency regime. Crucially, we do not expect the central bank to use international reserves to finance government spending, a policy that would threaten monetary and financial stability.

We expect real GDP to recover only modestly in 2021, expanding by just 2%, reflecting weak sequential growth over the year, as well as negative base effects (subdued growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 produced a mildly negative statistical carryover effect). A recovery in private consumption will be restrained by a lack of fiscal support for consumers amid the Covid-19 crisis and a slow improvement in labour market conditions.
Considering the scale of last year's collapse in investment, the recovery in 2021 will be extremely weak, with economic and political uncertainties dampening economic activity in the election-dominated first half of the year. Sequential economic growth in the second half of the year will be buoyed by stronger performance in major export markets and an easing of coronavirus restrictions; we forecast that investment will begin a firmer recovery in the second half of the year as election-related risks ebb. Nonetheless, the recovery beyond 2021 will be weak; even assuming modest improvements to the business environment under the auspices of the Fund, we do not expect real GDP to return to 2019 levels until 2024-making Ecuador a laggard in the region and globally.t
Economic forecast: Sectoral trends Notwithstanding efforts by the Lasso administration to diversify the economy, the oil sector will remain critically important to Ecuador. Oil export earnings collapsed in 2020 as prices tumbled, but typically account for about 40% of total export revenue and 20% of government revenue; global oil prices will be firmer in the forecast period than in 2020 (supported by the strengthening global economic recovery in 2021-22), meaning that revenue will return to pre-crisis levels. However, oil production will remain below ambitious government targets. On the campaign trail, Mr Lasso floated the lofty goal espoused by his predecessor of achieving 700,000 barrels/day, from about 500,000 b/d at present. One objective tied to this production target is improving the governance and transparency of Petroecuador (the state-owned oil firm, which recently merged with Petroamazonas, another state-owned oil firm), which accounts for about 80% of national production. Mr Lasso is likely to achieve modest success in lifting production by adapting the framework for production-sharing agreements (respecting existing contracts) to make it more attractive for private-sector players to invest. However, delays and pressure from environmental and social groups will temper production ambitions. At the same time, tangible progress on improving the management of the state oil firm is likely to be slow, partly because of administrative hitches arising from the merger.
Growth in the oil sector will come primarily from increased production at the 1.6bn-barrel, heavy crude Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) oilfield. The merger of Petroecuador and Petroamazonas is likely to enable the further development of the ITT oilfield, as there were previously disagreements between the firms pertaining to pipeline infrastructure. A factor that will slow progress, however, is that Mr Lasso has sought to assuage environmental concerns about his production ambitions by backing an audit of oil operations in the Yasuní national park, where the oilfield is located. He has also supported the use of environmental impact assessments as a way of improving transparency. Although this may help to improve compliance and valuations, it is likely to preclude a faster expansion of production.
Mining sector enters growth phase, but obstacles persist The mining sector will continue to gain prominence over the medium term. It will become increasingly important for the state finances and is poised to expand, as two major mining projects driven by foreign investors came online in late 2019: Fruta del Norte (a gold mine) and Mirador (primarily a copper mine). At the beginning of 2021 the government projected that Fruta del Norte had generated nearly US$322m in export earnings in 2020 (up from US$46m in 2019) and Mirador about US$239m. Earnings will rise over the medium term: export revenue from the Fruta del Norte mine is projected to reach US$998m in 2025, and the government estimates that the Mirador mine's export earnings will top US$1.1bn in the same year. The sector will continue to expand (buoyed by the removal in 2019 of a 70% "windfall tax" on mining profits) as a series of further projects attract major mining companies that compete for stakes.
The new government will attempt to balance its efforts to boost investment in the mining sector with the need to address environmental and social opposition to new projects. Lingering legal uncertainties and local resistance will persist, underscored by a February referendum in which voters in Cuenca (Ecuador's third-largest city) overwhelmingly chose to prohibit large-scale mining in groundwater recharge zones of five local rivers. Friction between local communities and mining firms is likely to slow investment, even as the Lasso administration attempts to design a framework that encourages private-sector participation in the sector. Many mineral deposits are located in environmentally sensitive areas, close to communities that have lodged complaints with local courts alleging that mining firms have failed to undergo consultation processes. That said, a lack of cohesion among anti-mining activists and differences in opinion within Ecuador make the imminent cancellation of major mining projects currently under construction and under advanced exploration unlikely. Our view is that the mining sector will continue to face difficulties that will prevent a more dramatic rise in extractive production.

We expect dollarisation to be maintained throughout the 2021-25 forecast period. De-dollarisation remains an unlikely political move, given high levels of support for the exchange regime, on the basis that it promotes macroeconomic stability. Under Mr Lasso, we expect the government to remain committed to restoring health to the public finances, building up reserves and adopting policies to strengthen the BCE's independence. Multilateral and bilateral financing will help to assuage concerns about financing and liquidity amid limited access to international capital markets.

We are cautiously optimistic about the health of Ecuador's external accounts; we expect the current account to remain in surplus and to average 1.3% of GDP in 2021-25, owing to two main factors. First, we expect an expansion of non-oil export earnings (as external demand recovers and mining exports gain momentum) and oil export revenue (as global prices rise) to drive a trade surplus throughout 2021-25. Secondly, the sovereign's recent debt restructuring entails a significant decline in interest payments in the medium term, which will keep the primary income deficit narrower than before the pandemic.
Current-account surpluses and multilateral financing (particularly from the Fund) will help the BCE to bolster foreign-exchange reserves, cushioning potential adverse fiscal and financial shocks. Notwithstanding Mr Lasso's plans to bolster investment, we remain sceptical that this will materialise quickly and expect foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows to remain weak in 2021-25, at an average of about 1% of GDP, and concentrated in extractive industries.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Ecuador Stocks and flows Ecuador has historically attracted little foreign direct investment (FDI). Annual inflows of FDI averaged US$700m in 1994-2008, driven mainly by the oil sector (which accounted for 80% of the total). After barely breaching US$1bn (1.8% of GDP) in 2008, FDI inflows fell to only US$165m in 2010. They recovered to average US$774m (0.8% of GDP) in 2011-17, during the presidency of Rafael Correa (2007-17), whose policies led to a deterioration in investor confidence. FDI inflows improved at the margin under his successor, Lenín Moreno (2017-21), reflecting a more conciliatory approach to the private sector, but inflows remained low, averaging 1% of GDP during his term. Given that FDI inflows were already quite weak before the Covid-19 crisis, there was less of a discernible affect on FDI in Ecuador than in other countries; inflows reached US$1bn (1% of GDP) in 2020. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the total stock of inward FDI was US$20.6bn at end-2020. This is one of the smallest stocks among the major Latin American economies, equating to 20.9% of GDP. The outlook for FDI is brighter in the 2021-25 forecast period than in the 2016-20 historical period, owing to the new government's openness to foreign investment, but a weak business environment and investor wariness about the direction of policy under future administrations will dampen inflows.
Origin and distribution US firms (historically Ecuador's main source of FDI) went through a period of disinvestment in the country in 2008-10, largely owing to uncertainty surrounding oil contract renegotiations and the global financial crisis. Investment from the US has since moderated, averaging 7% of total inflows in 2016-20. FDI from China rose after Ecuador established closer trade and diplomatic ties with that country in 2011, but inflows have tapered off recently. In 2020 Chinese FDI accounted for 6% of inflows, down from 11% in 2016. Foreign investment is primarily directed towards oil, mining and infrastructure projects, as reflected by the origin of inflows; in 2020, 29% of foreign investment originated from Canada (the major Fruta del Norte gold mine is owned by a Canadian firm). The manufacturing, agri- and aqua-culture, and retail sectors attract foreign investment, but extractive industries account for the majority, attracting about 50% of FDI inflows in 2018-20.
Determinants Although Ecuador has a wealth of natural resources, policy uncertainty and an unreliable business environment have deterred investment. The Moreno administration took a more active role than its predecessor in attracting private foreign investment; his government focused on fomenting investment in the extractive sectors, reintroducing production-sharing contracts and eliminating the 70% "windfall tax" on profits in mining. However, stronger interest from foreign investors did not materialise, as the uncertain regulatory and legal environment tempered his administration's efforts to boost foreign investment. Moreover, weak institutions, a small domestic market, a relatively high cost of labour and low income levels still deter market-seeking or efficiency-seeking investments. Investments are likely to remain largely resource-seeking given Ecuador's natural resource endowment, even assuming moderate improvements to the business environment.
Impact The impact of inward FDI on productivity and export competitiveness has been limited because most investment has been directed towards capital-intensive natural resource sectors, which have weak links to the rest of the economy. However, FDI has helped to boost export earnings in the energy sector and to create indirect employment.
Potential The country's strong endowments of natural resources will be a major source of attraction for foreign investors. There are notable FDI opportunities in Ecuador's petroleum, mining, manufacturing and services sectors. Although policy uncertainty, infrastructure deficiencies and low levels of labour productivity persist, we expect incremental improvements to the business environment under the auspices of the IMF, improving the country's competitiveness. A more pragmatic approach to attracting private foreign capital and a continuing shift away from the unorthodox macroeconomic policies of Mr Correa's government will also provide upside to the country's medium-term attractiveness. Still, ingrained opposition from powerful domestic interest groups, as well as opposition from social groups, will continue to complicate efforts to open up investment opportunities in the oil sector. Sluggishness in consumption and a tepid recovery after the pandemic in 2020 will also deter investment.

Population growth is slowing In 2020 the population reached an estimated 17.5m and is expected to rise by 1.1m people by 2024. Given a falling birth rate and continued-albeit lower-emigration, the rate of population growth is slowing. However, at an annual average of 1.2% per year in the 2021-25 forecast period, growth will be high compared with developed-country standards and on a par with neighbours in the Andean region. The rate of urbanisation is relatively high; about 64% of the population lives in urban centres, compared with 55% in 1990. This percentage is likely to rise to about 65% by the end of the forecast period. Almost half of city dwellers reside either in the capital, Quito, or in the largest city and main business centre, Guayaquil. Rapid urbanisation over the past 50 years has increased the level of informality, as the creation of full-time jobs has risen much more slowly. The unemployment rate was 5.5% at the end of the first quarter of 2021, which is high by recent standards (the unemployment rate averaged 4.5% in 2015-19), but it was down from a peak of 13.3% in the second quarter of 2020 that came amid the near shutdown of the economy amid the initial coronavirus outbreak. Underemployment remains high, affecting more than half of the workforce. The labour force is expected to continue to expand more rapidly than the overall population during the forecast period, with about 600,000 new labour market entrants by 2025. Notwithstanding efforts by the new government to boost the creation of formal jobs, the formal economy will continue to struggle to absorb new entrants, particularly as diversification away from the energy-dominant labour market will be slow (and will focus primarily on mining and agriculture). Informal employment, estimated by the government at 47% of the labour force as at March, is therefore likely to stay high.
Immigration from Venezuela poses challenges Although inflows of illegal migrants from Colombia have fallen in recent years, inflows from Venezuela will put strain on the domestic labour market. Ecuador has received more than 400,000 migrants from Venezuela, and the government has struggled to integrate them into the formal market, especially in the wake of the coronavirus-induced recession. The slow economic recovery may well lead to weaker Venezuelan migration in the 2021-25 forecast period, with Venezuelans attracted to stronger neighbouring economies. However, the Lasso government is regularising Venezuelan migrants and is likely to try to formulate a strategy to improve their integration into the labour market.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Ecuador's crude birth rate to fall to an annual average of 19 per 1,000 population in 2021-25 (down from 20.3 in the 2016-20 historical period). The crude death rate will remain steady, at an annual average of 5.2 per 1,000 population in 2021-25. The old-age dependency ratio, which will rise slightly, reaching 0.14 by 2025, will remain low by developed-country standards. However, given constraints on public spending, an ageing population will place growing pressure on an already heavily indebted social security system, especially as the coronavirus pandemic has laid bare the many deficiencies in the healthcare system. Although the government plans to reduce its divestments from the state-run social security institute, we expect the state-run social security system to encounter difficulties in ending its debt woes.
Slow progress in improving education and healthcare standards The precarious state of the country's public finances will hinder improvements in education and healthcare standards. Strong oil revenue in the 2000s commodity boom allowed for improvements in poverty levels and social indicators following decades of underinvestment in these areas-public expenditure on health services and education doubled as a percentage of GDP under the previous administration. However, low standards and outcomes persist. Some gains were lost because of the 2015-16 recession; losses are also likely to occur in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis, as out-of-school learning has been limited during the pandemic. Regular labour conflicts with public healthcare and education workers, often resulting in industrial action, further hampered improvements in the quality of services. The 2008 constitution promised free universal healthcare and education, but the government will struggle to achieve these goals during the forecast period given its fiscal difficulties in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Improvements in education and healthcare standards will be only gradual, with progress crippled by narrow opportunities to raise spending in these areas.

Ecuador is one of the smallest markets included in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings, accounting for about 0.1% of global GDP and a similar share of global exports. Its oil and mineral reserves will continue to attract interest from foreign investors. The policy stance of the government led by the president, Guillermo Lasso, will encourage interest in the country, but questions about policy predictability and the government's ability to effect material improvements in the business environment are likely to preclude a sharp increase in private investment.
Market will expand modestly after coronavirus recession Boosted by a rising population but hindered by anaemic economic growth, as well as a dearth of fiscal support measures during the Covid-19 crisis, Ecuador's market size will expand modestly in the 2021-25 forecast period. GDP per head, estimated at US$6,261 in 2019, fell sharply in 2020, to US$5,643, and is forecast to reach only US$6,178 in 2025. This slow recovery in GDP per head will restrict business opportunities. Moreover, Ecuador's per-head income figures will continue to disguise wide inequalities. Despite a rise in consumption after the crisis in 2020, we expect reductions in income inequality to be marginal at best in 2021-25, as rates of unemployment-and in particular underemployment-will decrease only moderately in the wake of the crisis.
The government of a former president, Rafael Correa (2007-17), invested the proceeds of the oil price boom in upgrading the country's underdeveloped infrastructure. Substantial improvements were made in this period, particularly to the road system, but significant gaps remain. His successor, Lenín Moreno (2017-21) was unable to do the same given the need for fiscal adjustment, and attempted to attract private investors to invest in infrastructure, but with limited success. The new Lasso administration will endeavour to close infrastructure gaps by improving the legal framework to provide a moderate boost for investment (domestic and foreign), notably in the export-oriented energy and mining sectors, and related services. However, despite a strong natural resource endowment, growth in exports will remain below potential, and Ecuador's share of world exports will stagnate at about 0.1%.
As a result of dollarisation and successive years of guaranteeing a "living wage" (essentially a minimum wage), Ecuador is no longer a cheap-labour investment location. In US dollar terms, the country's minimum wage is one of the highest in Latin America. Also weighing on the country's competitiveness are low skills levels. However, dollarisation facilitates greater overall macroeconomic stability for businesses to assess investment opportunities, particularly by reducing inflation and exchange-rate risks. Investment in most areas outside the oil sector will be slow to arrive, as improvements to the business environment will be incremental, given political hurdles amid a highly fragmented political landscape. At the same time, advancements in the transparency and efficiency of the judicial system will be slow to take effect.

Business opportunities limited by low level of development As disposable incomes only rise gradually in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis, a shift in consumer attitudes towards cheaper brands and lower-cost, high-volume outlets is likely in the near term. Over the medium to long term, we expect purchasing power to pick up from a trough in 2020 as labour market conditions improve. As incomes rise, a smaller proportion of real disposable income will be spent on food and housing, shifting instead to consumer durables and other high-ticket items. The proportion of income spent on leisure and education, hotels and restaurants, and other high-end goods will remain low. Ecuador's market will remain comparatively small. Dollarisation will provide price and exchange-rate stability, but economic development will be slow, hindered by a dearth of fiscal support measures for consumers and businesses that will do permanent damage to household incomes and businesses' balance sheets.

Ample scope for catch-up but challenges persist Ecuador's wealth of natural resources, a young and expanding middle class and a push to improve educational standards offer scope to catch up with more developed countries over the next four decades. However, a series of challenges need to be addressed over the short and medium term to build on these positive conditions. Although the investment rate has improved considerably, investment remains overly reliant on public-sector spending, which is vulnerable to changes in commodity prices. Private investment is scant and overall savings are low, two factors that are likely to improve only moderately in the coming years, holding down productivity growth. Despite a more stable policy framework, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that Ecuador's institutions will strengthen only moderately and that progress in tackling a large informal sector will be limited. Nevertheless, higher spending on health and education should help to improve labour productivity growth in 2031-50. In this context-and barring a sharp and prolonged deterioration in the country's terms of trade or a return to severe political instability-we expect the economy to expand more robustly in 2031-50 (by an annual average of 2.2%), following tepid GDP growth in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis (averaging 0.7% in 2021-30).
Initial conditions: Rapid urbanisation in the past 30 years and faster integration into the world economy have produced few long-term benefits for the population. Political instability, weak institutions and high levels of poverty and inequality-combined with an economy overly dependent on oil-have yielded a rent-seeking and unproductive economy, plagued by low education levels and productivity, and high labour informality. The government of Rafael Correa (2007-17) made efforts to address low social indicators and improve infrastructure, but failed to boost private investment and savings. The Correa government also harmed the legal framework for investment by constantly changing regulations and putting up hurdles to capital. Although dollarisation has brought macroeconomic stability since 2000, it has also made Ecuador less competitive and has accentuated the risks of inadequate fiscal management.
Demographic trends: Population growth is set to fall gradually over the long term, from an average of 1.2% in 2020-30, to 0.8% in 2031-50. The main cause will be lower fertility rates, in addition to some net migration. On the upside, we project that the growth of the working-age population will continue to outstrip overall population growth until 2040, providing a major demographic boom and keeping the dependency ratio low. The main challenge facing the country will be to create enough formal jobs for entrants to the labour market, so as to reduce informality. There has been some progress in expanding education across all levels to improve labour quality, but the lack of dynamism in the private sector means that there is a substantial risk of labour informality remaining high in the long term. An additional challenge is to tackle the pension needs of an ageing population, which could increase strains on the country's vulnerable social security system.
External conditions: As a small, open economy, Ecuador has benefited from rising global trade, although it remains vulnerable to changes in commodity prices. This in turn causes significant external and fiscal volatility, as demonstrated by the coronavirus crisis. Inconsistent trade policies and long geographical distances will dampen the potential for stronger integration with industrialised nations or blocs like the US and EU (traditionally Ecuador's main trade partners). There is scope for rising trade integration with neighbouring countries, but progress will be hindered by a lack of supply-chain strategies and infrastructure constraints. There has been some success in export diversification towards the Middle East, Russia and Asia, but Ecuador's small and distant market will act as a drag on its competitiveness profile, particularly compared with Asian emerging markets. With the economy likely to remain heavily reliant on hydrocarbons and some mineral and agricultural products, the external sector and GDP growth will hinge on the direction of terms of trade.
Future governments will struggle with a weak institutional framework Institutions and policy trends: Ecuador's institutions have long suffered from periods of instability, and despite a growing sense of macroeconomic and political stability in the past couple of years, they remain fundamentally weak. Inconsistent policymaking remains a major problem, both in conceiving and implementing new legislation. Successive administrations have changed policy directions. The current government, under Guillermo Lasso, will struggle owing to a weak legislative position and its lack of sustained support from a clear majority of the population; future governments will also find these issues difficult to overcome. Although power is concentrated in the hands of the executive, a highly fragmented political and social landscape will complicate governability. In the short term, this will be tangible as the government endeavours to restore health to the public finances after fiscal profligacy under the Correa administration. Regardless of their ideological inclination, future governments will continue to struggle with a weak legal framework, corruption and distorted policy priorities that either favour special interest groups or act as a major drag on the public finances.
Dollarisation will be protected by its persistent popularity Dollarisation: The policy of dollarisation will be retained, as it garners wide support for delivering price and exchange-rate stability. Moreover, the costs of abandonment-in particular the fear of stoking social unrest-are high. Despite risks to the currency regime posed by fiscal adjustment challenges, we expect commitment to an IMF-backed economic programme to strengthen the foundations of dollarisation; since 2019, under the auspices of the Fund, the government has approved legislation to bolster the country's medium-term fiscal framework and has strengthened the independence of the central bank. Continued IMF support augurs a more sustainable fiscal trajectory that is congruent with a fully dollarised economy. We are cautiously optimistic that, although reform progress will be complicated by sizeable barriers to governability, the long-term sustainability of dollarisation will be reinforced and that Ecuador's fiscal stance will be more stable.
Long-term performance: Unattractive investment conditions and the lack of a competitive, skilled labour force will make Ecuador a relatively unappealing destination for foreign investment in labour-intensive or manufacturing activities. However, sustained improvements in education levels, topped with productive investment in non-oil sectors and technology transfer, could make Ecuador more competitive and boost long-term growth. For this to occur, the country would need to strengthen its institutional framework and improve its business environment. Although the Lasso administration will pursue policies that strengthen private-led growth, our forecast suggests that the advancement of structural reforms will be slow and insufficient for Ecuador to catch up income-wise, with OECD countries in the long term.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends The country is prone to earthquakes and will therefore continue to suffer from natural disaster risk, but its adaptation and readiness will improve following a particularly devastating earthquake in 2016. Climate change preparedness, however, is more lacking. Ecuador's geographical location and diversity render it particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Owing to the near constant temperature year-round, rising temperatures have threatened the development of glaciers, as they have not been able to replenish lost density during colder seasons. Indeed, Ecuador has experienced a significant reduction in the size of its glaciers in the two main mountain ranges-the Cordillera Oriental and the Cordillera Occidental-which in aggregate have been reduced by about a third over the past 50 years. By 2050 this trajectory will jeopardise the water sources for the country's major urban centres, such as the capital, Quito. Rising temperatures will also affect agricultural production, as warmer winters will cause crops to sprout prematurely, and greater volatility in precipitation rates will disrupt production.
Sustainability concerns will take centre stage in the medium to long term. Renewable energy currently accounts for about 90% of electricity generation, with hydroelectric power accounting for nearly all of this. Hydroelectric and geothermal power primarily, and wind and solar power secondarily, will play an important role in the medium to long term. However, the heavy use of hydroplants will raise the risk of climate-related infrastructure risks as erosion forces costly repairs. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to incrementally roll back its high fuel subsidies to make way for these renewable sources, which will offer increasing business opportunities. However, in the short term, the government will continue to promote oil and mining production, which may pose long-term threats to environmental stability.
Migration and urbanisation Urbanisation in Ecuador is a relatively recent phenomenon and comparatively low for Latin America. The majority of the population has traditionally lived in rural communities in the mountainous region (sierra). Since crossing the 50% threshold in 1990, the percentage of people living in cities has grown slowly, from about 62% in 2006 to 64% in 2020. The establishment of a middle class under a social spending and consumption-driven economic policy in the 2000s, particularly by the administration of Rafael Correa (2007-17), will sustain a large urban population. Meanwhile, security concerns in the north and environmental degradation in the sierra are likely to accelerate the pace of migration from rural areas to cities in the medium term. The country's infrastructure and natural resources will be strained in the process, necessitating greater investment. There will be opportunities for public-private partnerships for infrastructure investment, but internal migration will also invite limited bouts of social unrest.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2016-20) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2021-25). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2016-20. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2021-25 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2016-20 ranges are then used to derive 2021-25 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2021-25, not to the likely situation in 2025 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2018 or 2023). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the coalition government, led by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), with Imran Khan as prime minister, to serve a full term (with the military's tacit support) until the next general election, which is due in 2023. However, the ruling coalition's slim majority in the lower house of parliament will continue to pose a risk to political stability until the end of its term. The military will play a dominant role in the country's politics, particularly on issues relating to domestic security and foreign policy. The precarious security situation will remain a source of instability during our forecast period (2021-25). Despite strained ties with India over the dispute in Kashmir, we do not forecast an outright military conflict. China will remain Pakistan's main strategic and economic partner throughout the forecast period.

- Pakistan's business environment will achieve a modest improvement from the historical period (2016-20), with the overall score increasing to 5.1 in 2021-25, from 4.47. It remains in last place among the 17 countries rated in the Asia-Pacific region and slips one place globally, owing to improvements elsewhere. A reduction in macroeconomic imbalances and associated risks supports the score. However, concerns about corruption and weak institutional capacity will continue to undermine the business environment. Efforts to expand power generation will provide businesses with improved access to electricity, but the associated price increases will weigh on profit margins.

- Real GDP will grow by an annual average of 4.1% in fiscal years 2021/22-2024/25 (July-June). Downside risks to economic growth for 2021-22 will come from recurrent waves of Covid-19 infection as the country is unable to vaccinate a significant share of the population. The government's efforts to rein in the fiscal deficit will weigh on investment and economic growth in 2021-25. The twin deficits on the current and fiscal accounts will pose persistent (albeit reduced) macroeconomic risks during the forecast period. Pakistan will continue to require bilateral and multilateral loans (which we expect it to receive) to stave off balance-of-payments difficulties. Although we expect the current account to register a deficit equivalent to 2% of GDP in 2022, from a slight surplus in 2020, the deficit will remain narrower-both in absolute terms and as a percentage of GDP-than it was in 2018, when Pakistan faced a balance-of-payment crisis.

- Pakistan's population will cross the 225m mark in 2021 and will continue to rise, putting additional pressure on scarce resources. The rate of expansion in the working-age population will outpace overall population growth. Rapid urbanisation will provide an opportunity for increased economic output, but productivity growth will remain sluggish. We expect that Pakistan will be unable to benefit fully from its "demographic dividend", owing to low female participation rates and weak investment in education. The government will have only limited ability to generate jobs for the growing workforce.

- GDP per head at market exchange rates dipped to US$1,189 in 2019/20, from US1,482 in 2017/18 and US$1,289 in 2018/19, owing to the income shock caused by the pandemic and macroeconomic imbalances. GDP per head will rise throughout the forecast period, while remaining below its 2017/18 level. Pakistan's low level of development and average income mean that food will still account for a large share of consumer expenditure in 2021-25. Wide regional differences in income mean that market opportunities for big-ticket consumer goods and luxury items will be concentrated in urban areas, where a middle class is emerging.

- We forecast the population to grow from 225m in 2021 to around 338m by 2050. In theory, demographic trends will be conducive to rapid GDP growth, but the authorities have not planned adequately for the expansion of the labour force and have failed to spend enough on infrastructure, education and other social services. The institutional and policy outlook will remain highly volatile, given the strong role of the armed forces. Successive governments are likely to increase development spending during the long-term forecast period, but such expenditure will continue to be hampered by fiscal constraints and the prioritisation of defence spending. Strengthened ties with China will help to address some infrastructure challenges.

Background: The Islamic Republic of Pakistan was founded in 1947. East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) seceded in 1971. There have been several coups since independence. The most recent was in 1999, when the chief of army staff, Pervez Musharraf, became the chief executive of Pakistan. He ruled first as chief executive and then as president until 2008. The general election in 2008 resulted in a new coalition government, led by the Pakistan People's Party (PPP). Pakistan witnessed the second transition between elected governments in its history after the July 2018 general election, which ushered in a new coalition government led by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), under the leadership of Imran Khan.
Political structure: Parliamentary supremacy over the presidency was restored in 2010, when both houses of the legislature approved a landmark amendment to the constitution. The PTI dominates a coalition government that comprises independents and smaller parties such as the Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid-i-Azam) and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement. Provinces are represented in the National Assembly (the lower house of parliament) in proportion to the size of their respective populations. In the Senate (the upper house), all four provinces have equal representation. Senators serve a term of six years, and half of the seats in the upper house come up for re-election every three years.
Policy issues: Pakistan faces an acute imbalance on its fiscal and external accounts. Large outlays for defence expenditure and debt-servicing obligations have led to wide fiscal deficits, while the balance of payments is strained because of a large financing gap. Owing to these imbalances, the country is reliant on the IMF and other bilateral and multilateral donors for fiscal and foreign-exchange reserve support.
Taxation: In the budget presented in June 2021, the standard rate of corporate income tax stayed at 29%. The rate for some companies, such as banks, remains higher. In fiscal year 2021/22 (July-June) the government also rescinded several tax exemptions previously provided to businesses. In terms of indirect taxes, the general sales tax (GST) remains at 17%.
Foreign trade: According to the IMF, merchandise exports stood at US$21.9bn in 2020, and imports totalled US$43.5bn, yielding a goods trade deficit of US$21.6bn.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Pakistan is a parliamentary federal republic with a bicameral legislature and Islam as the state religion. The National Assembly (the lower house of parliament) holds 342 seats and the Senate (the upper house) comprises 100 members. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) secured the largest number of seats in the 2018 election for the National Assembly. The PTI leads a coalition government that includes the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, the Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid-i-Azam), the Balochistan Awami Party and the Grand Democratic Alliance, among other parties, and a number of independents.
Although the PTI-led coalition holds more than half of the seats in the lower house, it lacks a simple majority in the upper house. Elections for half of the seats in the Senate are held every three years. In the most recent election (held in March 2021), the PTI emerged as the single largest party. The next upper-house election is scheduled to be held in 2024.
The provincial assemblies of Pakistan each represent a very distinct political landscape. A PTI-led coalition enjoys a majority in the provincial assembly of Punjab, the country's most populous province. Its principal challenger is the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), or PML (N), which has traditionally been the dominant political party in Punjab. The PTI and its allies also govern the provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, both of which have a relatively fragmented polity. In Sindh province, however, the PTI finds itself as the opposition in the provincial assembly. The Pakistan People's Party (PPP), which has traditionally dominated the political landscape in Sindh, continues to hold a majority in the provincial assembly.
The president is chosen by an electoral college comprising the upper and lower houses of parliament and the four provincial assemblies. Arif Alvi, a founding member of the PTI, was elected as the 13th president of Pakistan in September 2018, for a five-year term. The presidency is a largely ceremonial post in Pakistan's parliamentary system, where power resides with the prime minister as head of the executive.
Although the prime minister is responsible for most day-to-day decisions, the military is in de facto charge of national security and foreign policy. In particular, the armed forces drive the most important foreign-policy relationships-those with the US, China, India and Afghanistan. The PTI, which gained electorally in 2018 from the tacit support of the military, will remain amenable to this arrangement. As a result, relations between the civilian government and the armed forces will be positive.
Militant groups are also a significant force. The most important insurgent organisations are the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (also known as the Pakistani Taliban), an alliance of around a dozen militant groups that is unrelated to the Taliban in Afghanistan, and the Balochistan Liberation Army, a militant separatist group in that province. Furthermore, there are Islamist political organisations such as the now-banned Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which periodically lead large-scale demonstrations and campaigns on religious issues.

Political outlook: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government that took office in August 2018, led by the PTI, to serve its full term until 2023 under the prime minister, Imran Khan. The military (including its intelligence wing), which has a long history of political intervention, is expected to continue to support the PTI. This will help the current government to maintain its grip on power.
Opposition parties will be hobbled by legal challenges to their leaders. The PML (N) has been affected in recent years by adverse court rulings, which include the jailing in 2018 of its honorary leader, Nawaz Sharif (a former prime minister, currently abroad on expired medical bail). Nawaz Sharif's younger brother and the current president of the PML (N), Shehbaz Sharif, also faces charges over alleged corruption during his tenure as chief minister of Punjab province in 2013-18. The de facto leader of the PPP and a former president (2008-13), Asif Ali Zardari, was indicted for graft in October 2020 and faces other related investigations.
With the leadership of the PML (N) and the PPP facing legal proceedings, the two parties formed a political alliance, the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), with other, smaller entities in September 2020. In March 2021 the PDM pulled off a surprise win in the Senate elections, which forced the prime minister to conduct a vote of confidence. Although Mr Khan won that vote, the opposition demonstrated its ability to raise a potentially successful no-confidence motion. However, differences between the PPP and the PML (N) on the issue of mass resignation by legislators to force a snap election led to a split in the opposition alliance in April 2021. This has removed a near-term threat to the current government, but the slim nature of the ruling coalition's majority in the National Assembly continues to represent a risk to political stability.
In the medium term Islamist groups, such as the now-banned TLP, will continue to threaten political stability and social cohesion. Demonstrations on religious issues took place in April 2021, and we expect such events to recur during our forecast period (2021-25), with the risk of associated violence posing a challenge to law enforcement. We also expect the government and armed forces to continue to struggle with a separatist movement in Balochistan, but this will not pose a significant threat to political stability at the national level.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness In July 2018 Pakistan witnessed the second transfer of power between elected civilian governments in its 71-year history. Democratic norms are far from entrenched. The parliamentary election in 2018 was marred by a number of irregularities, including vote-rigging, as well as a lack of judicial impartiality. The country's political institutions remain weak and underdeveloped. Moreover, inefficient government bureaucracy and corruption will continue to undermine institutional effectiveness.
Tensions between the military and the civilian government have subsided since the PTI-led coalition took office, as the current government has been ardent in protecting the interests of the armed forces. The military's power remains strong, and it will continue to assert itself in a number of policy areas-not only security and foreign policy, but also economic policies such as the privatisation of state-owned enterprises.
Political effectiveness varies greatly from region to region. In the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, moves to increase the writ of government have often triggered conflict. In addition, secessionist elements are likely to remain active in Balochistan. With the opposition PPP in power in Sindh, conflicts between the provincial and federal governments over power-sharing (and, crucially, revenue-sharing) are likely to intensify. The risk is higher given the poor relations between the PPP and PTI.
The judiciary does not have a history of impartiality, having traditionally deferred to the interests of the armed forces. It has, for example, retroactively ratified all of the country's military coups. The judiciary is highly politicised and some of its high-profile members have been overtly pro-government. Although there have been instances of the judiciary asserting its independence in 2020-21, we do not believe that the legal system is likely to become a genuine guardian of the constitution within the forecast period. Partisanship has often detracted from rather than aided political effectiveness.
Political outlook: Election watch We expect the popularity of the ruling coalition to suffer during the remainder of its term as it strives to meet the conditions of an IMF programme, which resumed in March 2021. A rise in the cost of living and increases in the tax burden will be sources of disenchantment among Mr Khan's voter base. However, we do not expect this to translate into immediate gains for the opposition parties, which will continue to be hampered by legal challenges against their leaders. We therefore expect the ruling coalition to serve a full term until 2023. Our current baseline assumption is that the PTI-led coalition will win the next general election, with the military's support. However, the risks to this forecast remain high, especially if inflation does not decelerate in 2022-23 or if the opposition parties come together against the PTI.
Political outlook: International relations Although there will be increased diplomatic activity between Pakistan and India in 2021-25, we expect bilateral relations to remain fraught. Recent events have signalled a thaw in relations, with the two countries agreeing to a ceasefire in February 2021. However, cross-border terrorism and a decades-long sovereignty dispute over Kashmir will remain major obstacles to the normalisation of relations. Tensions will remain high, and Pakistan's military may increase its support for militant groups in Indian-controlled Kashmir. This will raise the risk of terrorist activity by non-state actors, similar to the attack on India's paramilitary forces in February 2019 that led to clashes between the two countries' armed forces. However, we do not expect a full-blown military conflict. Both countries are nuclear powers and will be wary of miscalculations that could accidentally result in the catastrophic use of those weapons.
China will remain Pakistan's leading economic and strategic partner in 2021-25, with bilateral ties strengthening amid the pandemic as China provides financial support and supplies vaccines to Pakistan. The deterioration in relations between China and India will reinforce China's links with Pakistan, especially in terms of investment in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which is claimed by India. Projects under the umbrella of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will be undertaken increasingly in the form of direct investment by Chinese firms. CPEC-related lending by China will continue in 2021-25, even amid fiscal constraints and concerns over debt sustainability. Lending support from China will also be forthcoming, to meet Pakistan's debt obligations and to support its balance-of-payments needs. Pakistan, in turn, will continue to supress any domestic protest against China's treatment of Muslims in Xinjiang.
Pakistan will continue to balance its relations with Turkey on one hand and with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries on the other, as they compete for influence in the Islamic world. Bilateral ties with Turkey will remain robust, with that country maintaining diplomatic support for Pakistan, particularly when the latter faces international pressure to act more strongly against terrorism. We do not expect Pakistan to recognise Israel officially in the near term.
The US exit from Afghanistan will challenge Pakistan's relations with the latter. We believe that Pakistan will look to support the Taliban militia in order to retain its influence in Afghanistan, while at the same time trying to ensure that instability does not make its neighbour a safe haven for its own separatist organisations. Relations with the US will remain strained. The tougher stance against Pakistan taken by the US president, Joe Biden, indicated by the absence of a phone call to the Pakistani prime minister nearly six months into his presidency, indicates a deterioration in bilateral relations. Pakistan could face punitive measures from the US for its support of the Taliban and other extremist organisations.

Pakistan's business environment will generally improve in the 2021-25 forecast period, with the country achieving an overall score of 5.10, compared with 4.47 in 2016-20. However, Pakistan remains 17th (and bottom) in the Asia-Pacific regional ranking. Globally, it slips by one place to 74th out of 82 countries, owing to greater improvements in other countries. The government, led by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), will remain weak because of its dependence on multiple coalition partners. However, continued tacit backing from the armed forces and a weak opposition will allow it to serve out its full term, ending in 2023. An inefficient bureaucracy will limit political effectiveness, and geopolitical tensions with neighbouring India and Afghanistan will keep instability in the political environment relatively high.
The government will continue the gradual liberalisation of rules on foreign investment, in an effort to offset investor concern about the difficult political and security environment. However, continued balance-of-payments strains mean that most bureaucratic obstacles and foreign-exchange controls will remain in place, impeding foreign trade and capital transfers. Business and policy reform efforts, under an IMF programme that resumed in early 2021, will achieve limited success because of competing political considerations. Corruption and tax evasion, often abetted by revenue officials, will remain widespread. The government will continue to expand ties with China and boost bilateral trade and investment. Projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will shift from energy and infrastructure to industrial investment, but at a slow pace. Levels of internet and mobile-phone penetration will continue to improve, while remaining low by global standards, meaning that Pakistan's technological readiness will remain poor. The country's research-and-development spending will also remain low.

Business environment outlook: Pakistan's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: The government tries to privatise some state-owned assets to raise public revenue, but progress is very limited.
2023-25: Private companies modestly increase their share of the economy under IMF-mandated reforms.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: The government promotes foreign investment in some sectors, especially infrastructure and energy. However, security and political risks and the fragility of the economy deter inward investment.
2023-25: The government makes some progress in setting up special economic zones under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). However, the poor business environment hinders efforts to attract non-Chinese investment to these zones.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Exchange-rate volatility is reduced considerably in comparison with 2018-20, owing to support provided by the IMF programme and debt-service suspension by G20 countries.
2023-25: Officials relax some import controls that were introduced in 2018-19 to ease pressure on the external account.
Taxes 2021-22: The corporate tax rate remains at 29%, which is high by regional standards. Corporate tax exemptions that were granted previously are rolled back. Indirect taxes on fuel and utilities are raised to support central-government revenue.
2023-25: The tax system remains complex and inefficient. Most citizens remain outside the tax net, but the authorities maintain their efforts to close tax loopholes and increase compliance for business and industry, with limited success.
Financing 2021-22: The cost of credit remains largely unchanged as the central bank eases monetary policy only towards the end of 2022. Lending is also constrained by risk-averse banks, owing to high levels of non-performing loans.
2023-25: Stockmarkets become more important as a funding channel for medium-sized and large companies, as the external sector stabilises and attracts foreign capital.
The labour market 2021-22: The unemployment rate declines gradually but nevertheless remains high, keeping a lid on wage inflation.
2023-25: The low literacy rate and limited spending on tertiary education hamper growth in the supply of skilled labour.
Infrastructure 2021-22: The 819-km Chaman-Quetta-Karachi motorway and some other road projects are completed. The Main Line 1 (ML-1) railway project, which aims to upgrade the country's existing rail infrastructure, is delayed.
2023-25: Power plants fuelled by renewable energy are built to diversify electricity generation. However, power blackouts and high energy prices persist. Telecommunications infrastructure continues to improve, but at a slow rate.
Technological readiness 2021-22: Spending on research and development remains depressed, as a result of adverse economic conditions.
2023-25: The government rolls out 5G spectrum, but network coverage is scant, limiting demand for compatible products.

Pakistan's macroeconomic environment score improves to 4.9 in 2021-25, from 4.1 in the historical period. While this will move it up five places in the global ranking, to 74th, Pakistan will remain at the bottom of the regional ranking. The economy will recover in 2021-22 from the downturn induced by the Covid-19 pandemic, achieving modest real GDP growth. The resumption of a US$6bn IMF reform programme in 2021 will support the external sector. However, with the next general election scheduled for 2023, politically motivated spending pressures pose a risk to the programme's completion. The current-account balance will slip into a deficit equivalent to 1.8% of GDP in 2021, from a surplus of 0.1% of GDP in 2020, owing to firming demand for imports. The current-account deficit will average 1.8% of GDP annually during the rest of the forecast period (2022-25),as modest economic growth keeps import demand in check.
Pakistan's external sector strains will be alleviated in 2021-22 by strong growth in remittance inflows and a combination of bilateral, multilateral and commercial sovereign financing. This will help it to continue to service foreign debt in 2021-25. However, vulnerabilities will remain, driven by a persistent trade deficit and high levels of public debt. Pakistan's foreign-exchange reserves will remain under pressure, leading to a progressive weakening of the currency during 2021-25. Inflationary pressures will remain high in the first half of the forecast period, owing to various tariff increases to support fiscal revenue. In the face of large debt-servicing obligations and high defence expenditure, the fiscal deficit will remain wide, averaging 5.8% of GDP during fiscal years 2021/22-2024/25 (July-June), limiting the government's ability to deliver on further development and social spending.
Business environment outlook: Policy towards private enterprise and competition

Pakistan will achieve some improvement in the policy towards private enterprise and competition category, with its global ranking rising by eight places to 58th in 2021-25, and a promotion of one place, to 13th, in the regional ranking. Indicator scores for government regulation on setting up new private businesses and freedom of existing businesses to compete have increased, as has the score for protection of intellectual property (albeit from a very low base). Gradual progress on business environment reforms and the growth of e-commerce will facilitate greater competition and new entrants to the market over the forecast period. Nevertheless, most of our gauges of Pakistan's policy towards private enterprise and competition will continue to rank below the regional average, as public entities and powerful cartels will continue to dominate key economic sectors over the forecast period. In line with this, scores for distortions arising from lobbying by special interest groups and distortions arising from state ownership/control will remain unchanged at their low levels.
The economy will slowly open up, but special interest groups will remain
- The PTI government will make some progress on its plans to restructure key loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs), with a view to their eventual privatisation. As a first step, in 2020 it approved plans to downsize significantly the workforces of Pakistan International Airlines and Pakistan Steel Mills-two entities that have become a major drain on the exchequer. The government also plans to open up the liquefied natural gas (LNG) import sector, which is expected to grow robustly during 2021-25, to private players. However, resistance from state monopolies in the energy sector and an inefficient bureaucracy will probably impede this process. Overall, bloated SOEs, particularly in the fuel and power sectors, will remain difficult to turn around or privatise owing to large financial liabilities and poor management.
- The Competition Commission of Pakistan is the national quasi-regulatory body tasked with preventing monopolistic practices. In 2020 it investigated the powerful sugar and cement cartels for price-fixing, but its overall effectiveness is limited; unfair business practices in the private sector will remain common in 2021-25. While Pakistan in theory boasts a favourable legal environment for private enterprise, in practice it is hampered by weak contract enforcement, an inefficient bureaucracy, burdensome regulations and policy uncertainty. Chinese investors and companies are likely to continue to receive favourable treatment from the government over the forecast period, in particular for the awarding of contracts, reducing opportunities for other businesses.

The military will continue to exert its influence in real estate and logistics
- The military will retain a significant influence on the economy during 2021-25. Its large monopolies, particularly in real estate and logistics, will continue to grow over the forecast period. Additionally, the armed forces' pension funds will continue to play a prominent role in the economy through ownership or shareholdings in industries ranging from cereals to banking. Apart from the military, politically connected business groups such as textiles exporters will continue to exercise undue market influence and receive frequent subsidies. As a result, the freedom of most companies to compete openly will remain constrained.

Pakistan's score for policy towards foreign investment will remain static in 2021-25. However, the country will drop two places in the global ranking (to 56th place) and one place regionally (to 11th) owing to improvements in other countries. The score for government policy towards foreign capital will remain above the regional average over the forecast period, but most other indicators will remain below it. The influence of special interest groups and frequent corruption in the award of public-sector contracts will remain the main reason behind the weak investment climate. In addition, the risk of expropriation will remain high for foreign investors in sectors where the armed forces have interests, with limited legal recourse in domestic courts and the absence of an effective dispute resolution mechanism. Although foreign investors are allowed to hold 100% equity in nearly all industrial sectors without prior permission, foreign direct investment is likely to remain comparatively low because of practical hindrances.

- The forecast period will see ongoing economic co-operation with China, based around the ambitious CPEC project aiming to link China's Xinjiang region with the Arabian Sea at Gwadar Port. China has pledged to invest more than US$60bn over 15 years, focused on energy and road and rail infrastructure. By the end of 2020 more than US$20bn had been invested in projects related to power generation, transport infrastructure and the development of Gwadar Port. CPEC-related investments will continue to be financed partially by the Chinese state and its banks, which lend money to Chinese companies to carry out the work, often with imported Chinese labour.

China will remain an important source of foreign direct investment
- Over the forecast period foreign investment is likely to remain concentrated in the energy, finance and telecommunications sectors and dominated by China. Nevertheless, there will still be opportunities for non-Chinese investors. The international Stellantis Group entered into an agreement with a local distributor in March 2021 for the manufacture of European brand vehicles. The following month a consortium led by Japan's Mitsubishi Corporation obtained a licence to construct a new LNG import terminal. Also in 2021, a subsidiary of the German KfW Group entered the insurance market by acquiring an equity stake in a local insurance company. After the government's approval of the country's first five-year electric vehicle policy in 2020, this is likely to be another area of future opportunity.
- The government will try to encourage investors to use the country as a base for international manufacturers to produce goods for export in 2021-25, through nine planned special economic zones (SEZs), which constitute one component of the CPEC initiative. While the government plans to offer streamlined investment facilitation procedures and tax breaks to attract foreign investors to these SEZs, none of them has been made operational so far. Foreign investment outside the SEZ framework-mainly from China-has nevertheless started to flow in, such as a China-Pakistan joint venture that launched a locally assembled passenger car in 2020, and the approval granted in 2021 to a Chinese state-owned automaker to manufacture electric vehicles at a local SEZ. However, a relatively low-skilled labour force, high energy costs and a poor overall business environment will limit the level of investment received by manufacturing in the forecast period.

Pakistan's global ranking for foreign trade and exchange controls will improve slightly in 2021-25, from 74th to 71st place, and it will move off the bottom of the regional rankings by one place, to 16th. Pakistan has lowered tariffs since it joined the World Trade Organisation in 1995. According to the World Bank, the average weighted tariff came down from 20.6% in 2001 to its lowest level of 8.7% in 2019. Nevertheless, taxes on imports, particularly on petroleum products, will remain a vital source of revenue for the government and are subject to frequent revision. We expect the government to make some progress in reducing non-tariff barriers. Nevertheless, non-tariff barriers in general, occasional import bans and restrictions in response to balance-of-payments pressure, inconsistent regulations and opaque policymaking will remain significant hurdles to international trade over the forecast period.
Trading will continue to face multiple challenges
- Exports remain dominated by textiles, which accounts for more than half of overall export receipts. Pakistan has found it difficult to diversify exports away from the sector. Textiles exports largely comprise lower-value items such as cotton cloth rather than higher-value items such as garments. Pakistan's complex and inconsistent regulations, inefficient bureaucracy and infrastructure bottlenecks will be reformed only slowly and will feed into relatively high business costs. This is reflected in low scores for openness of trade (which is well below the regional average) and ease of trading.
- In 2021-22 exports will grow strongly as global demand recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic. In the national budget for 2021/22, reduced duties on imports of raw materials for the textile industry will also aid in export growth. Exports during 2021-25 will also be aided by the elimination of duties by China on 313 products from Pakistan, which took effect in 2020. US restrictions on cotton sourced from the Chinese region of Xinjiang will also support exports. However, structural weaknesses in Pakistan's economy will weigh on export growth throughout the forecast period.
- After contracting in 2020 because of the impact of the pandemic, imports will grow robustly in 2021-22 as the economy recovers. A reduction in tariffs in the budget for 2021/22 and higher crude oil prices will further inflate the import bill. Import growth will continue to outstrip that of exports over the forecast period, leading to a continuous increase in the trade deficit and persistent pressure on the external account. Partly as a result of this, capital controls on the cross-border movement of foreign exchange will remain relatively stringent over the forecast period, making financial operations awkward for foreign businesses.

Business environment outlook: Taxes

Pakistan's score for taxes remains unchanged in 2021-25. However, because of the relatively slow pace of tax reform compared with other countries, its global ranking will drop from 51st to 65th in the forecast period. Its regional position will also worsen, slipping three places to 15th out of 17 countries. Pakistan scores particularly poorly for tax complexity, and below the regional average for most other indicators in this category. By contrast, its score for the top marginal personal income tax is above the regional average. Overall, a lack of consistency in policy, patchy application and cumbersome legal procedures will remain the principal concerns for private enterprises over Pakistan's tax policy framework.
The tax system will remain largely inefficient
- In an effort to improve documentation and curb tax evasion over the forecast period, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) will continue to enhance its database of potential taxpayers and efforts to trace retail sales. Although this may force some tax evaders into compliance, we do not expect a widespread improvement in the efficiency of the FBR over the forecast period. Overall, these policy measures are likely to lead to some improvement in tax collection. However, we do not expect meaningful reform of the agency. Apart from inefficiency and corruption, it suffers from frequent changes in leadership and political interference, hampering institutional autonomy.

Indirect taxes are set to rise in 2021-25
- In the budget for 2021/22, the government has not imposed additional income taxes; maintained the rate of general sales tax at 17%; and lowered import duties on some items used as inputs by domestic industries. Taxes and levies on imported petroleum products-a key source of revenue-have been increased. In general, the government will continue to rely heavily on indirect means (duties and sales taxes) to expand revenue collection during 2021-25, but the tax/GDP ratio will remain low owing to a narrow tax base and relatively large informal economy. We expect increases in electricity and gas tariffs over the forecast period, as well as a gradual (though not complete) reduction in subsidies to large industrial customers such as fertiliser and power plants, owing to the fiscal constraints faced by the government. Agricultural income is unlikely to face taxation over the forecast period. The tax burden will fall mainly on the large-scale manufacturing sector, which has a relatively small share of total GDP at factor cost. This means that the rate of overall business taxation is likely to remain comparatively high during the forecast period.
- The corporate tax rate is currently 29%. It is unlikely that it will be reduced further during the forecast period, as the government will still need to increase revenue to contain the fiscal deficit.

The score for Pakistan's financing environment will stay unchanged over the forecast period. However, its global ranking will fall from 50th to 65th. In the Asia-Pacific region it will move down five spots to 16th, one off the bottom, as other countries make improvements. Although there will be an economic recovery in 2021-22, banks' balance sheets are likely to deteriorate in this period because of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Commercial banks, mainly privately owned, will nevertheless remain the most important source of short-term credit in Pakistan, with overdrafts the principal form of short-term borrowing. Bank credit to fund the government's large fiscal deficit will continue to crowd out private-sector borrowing to some extent. Access to financing will improve gradually in the latter part of the forecast period as the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP, the central bank) undertakes a loosening of monetary policy and the fiscal deficit narrows. The capitalisation of the stockmarket will remain low compared to most regional economies, but is expected to grow at a robust pace over the forecast period.

- Weaknesses in the legal framework, inefficient foreclosure processes and a scarcity of information for assessing collateral quality and borrower creditworthiness will pose ongoing problems for banks over the forecast period. Nevertheless, bank credit to the private sector has increased gradually during the last decade, and is expected to maintain growth in 2021-25. The majority of this will remain directed at the corporate and industrial sectors, leaving a relatively large funding gap for small and medium-sized industries in the absence of a vibrant small finance ecosystem. The government's focus on low-cost housing finance is likely to result in an increase in banks' mortgage portfolios, albeit from a very low base.
- A dual system of Western and Islamic financing will remain in operation in 2021-25. A large section of the conservative population views the Western interest-based banking system with suspicion, resulting in rapid growth in Islamic banking; by December 2020 the sector's assets amounted to 17% of the overall banking sector, according to the central bank. Nevertheless, deposit-taking and lending with interest by Western-style commercial banks will remain the dominant form of banking during the forecast period.

Mobile banking services will become more popular
- Branchless-banking services, which use a combination of licensed agents and mobile devices, will continue to expand robustly in 2021-25 as mobile-phone penetration rises. After the SBP issued regulatory guidelines allowing non-banking companies to issue electronic money (e-money) services in 2019, numerous financial technology companies have been given approval to provide such services. The government is using branchless banking to disburse certain payments, which will spur growth further. These developments are likely to help to promote financial inclusion among small businesses and the population at large, which remains low.

The outlook for Pakistan's labour market is positive, with steady progress pushing the country up 11 places to 63rd in the global ranking and one place (from bottom to 16th) in the region in 2021-25. The level of technical skills indicator will improve over the forecast period, as tertiary education slowly expands. Similarly, a favourable regulatory regime will lead to improvements in the restrictiveness of labour laws and extent of wage regulation indicators. The overall score is boosted in particular by the country's very low cost of labour and its low cost of living in comparison with other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Pakistan's workforce will expand by a robust 2.2% a year on average over the forecast period. While education is considered a priority in domestic politics and by aid donors and multilateral institutions, fiscal constraints mean that we expect only very slight growth in public healthcare and education expenditure by the government over the forecast period.
Overall educational standards will remain low
- The government will continue to pursue measures aimed at raising the literacy rate, which stood at around 60% nationally in 2020-a level at which it has stagnated since 2015. The urban population has a much higher literacy rate compared with rural areas and supplies labour to the manufacturing and services sectors. There is a large gender divide in educational attainment, with the female literacy rate significantly lower than that for males. Coupled with religious conservatism, this translates into an extremely low participation rate for women in the labour force; in 2018 (latest available data) this was just 21.9%, compared with 80.3% for men, according to data by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The government is likely to prioritise higher education at the expense of primary and secondary schooling in 2021-25, partly because investment in tertiary education is more popular among the vocal urban elite. Consequently, the country will continue to have a mass of poorly educated people and a small, well-educated elite, many of whom will emigrate.
- Pakistan will continue to face criticism over the use of child and bonded labour. Legislation passed to ban debt bondage in 1992 has failed to end the practice, owing largely to lacklustre enforcement and a large informal economy. Debt bondage is expected to remain prevalent in industries such as agriculture, brick-making, and carpet-weaving in particular. According to Child Rights Movement, an umbrella coalition of Pakistani non-governmental organisations, around 12.5m children in Pakistan were involved in labour in 2016. The ILO describes the situation in the country as one of the worst in the world.

Pakistan's infrastructure score will improve to 5.0 in 2021-25, from 3.8 in the historical period, following sustained investment in its road network, port infrastructure, electricity supply and mobile telecommunications network. However, its global rank will remain constant at 68th, while it will drop one spot regionally to 13th. The score for reliability of electricity supply will increase, albeit from a very low base, as will that for mobile network coverage, broadband connection speed, the infrastructure for retail and wholesale distribution and extent and quality of road network. This indicates that both digital and physical infrastructure will improve over the forecast period. Pakistan will also continue to have some of the lowest office rents in the region. Nonetheless, the country's overall infrastructure, as it relates to enabling business, will remain relatively poor, owing to decades of underinvestment.
Energy, transport and telecoms infrastructure will improve slowly
- The CPEC project will remain the cornerstone of efforts to modernise the transport, energy and power sectors in 2021-25. The US$3bn cross-country Peshawar-Karachi motorway has been mostly completed, with the last leg in Sindh province (connecting Sukkur city to Karachi) expected to be finished by 2025. In the first half of the forecast period the government aims to add road construction projects for the underdeveloped Baluchistan province under the CPEC umbrella. The development of Gwadar port, located strategically on the Arabia Sea in Baluchistan, will remain a priority CPEC project. However, progress is likely to be slow because of fiscal constraints and the unclear commercial viability of the port. A large CPEC-related infrastructure project, the US$7.2bn upgrade of the Peshawar-Karachi railway line, has yet to begin amid mounting fiscal and debt concerns. However, a mass transit rail project developed under the CPEC in the country's second-most populous city, Lahore, was successfully launched in 2020.
- Over 2021-25 the government will make further efforts to improve the reliability of electricity supply. Imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) will increasingly replace domestic natural gas and furnace oil for power generation. While coal-fired projects will be pursued, the government intends to diversify generation through renewable sources as well, releasing a national policy for this purpose in 2020. Several hydropower projects are planned under the CPEC, the largest of which will be the 1,100-MW Kohala project slated for completion in 2026. The government will also deepen nuclear co-operation with China, despite opposition by the US and India; in March 2021 the 1,100-MW K-2 nuclear power plant was connected to the national grid. While these initiatives will significantly reduce electricity supply shortages over the forecast period, the key challenge will remain the underfunded transmission and distribution segment. This has led to accumulating circular debt (the high inter-company arrears that delay payments through the electricity generation and supply chain), which is unlikely to be eliminated during 2021-25.

Water security will remain a concern
- Pakistan will face acute water shortages over the forecast period; it already has to deal with widespread seasonal shortages and chronic deficiencies in some urban areas, including the commercial capital, Karachi. The government will continue to prioritise the Diamer-Bhasha dam-a megaproject for both hydropower generation and water storage-to meet this challenge; a construction agreement was signed with a Chinese firm in May 2020. However, financing such large infrastructure projects will remain a challenge in 2021-25, owing to large fiscal deficits.

Pakistan's score for technological readiness will improve in 2021-25, albeit from a low base, moving the country up four places to 74th globally. However, its regional position will remain unchanged at 16th. The indicator score for Pakistan's quality of e-commerce business environment will improve, driven by rising demand and investment in the sector. The score for scope of e-government will also rise (from a very low base) as government services are slowly digitised. The SBP is working on various projects to promote the digitalisation of government payments, and we expect more of these to be moved online during the forecast period. Pakistan will continue to lag far behind its regional peers in the areas of internet use and mobile-phone subscriptions, despite growth in both areas during 2021-25.
Defence technology and e-commerce will grow
- Research-and-development spending in the private sector will remain extremely low during the forecast period, while the efforts of the Higher Education Commission to promote academic research and innovation will produce limited results because of low funding. However, defence-related research spending is likely to rise, driven by the demands of the armed forces, which are keen to modernise their systems and equipment. This will occur against a backdrop of dwindling security assistance from the US but increasing co-operation in defence technology with China. One example is the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft, developed jointly by Pakistan and China. In May 2021, Nigeria became the first country to purchase the JF-17, with export orders from other countries likely during the forecast period.
- Pakistan's e-commerce market has great potential, with the number of merchants and consumers expected to grow at a rapid rate in 2021-25. With Pakistan's first e-commerce policy having been approved in October 2019, we expect added momentum in the sector over the forecast period. The emergence of several online marketplaces and rising internet use have attracted the attention of foreign investors. For example, in May 2021 Facebook (US) announced co-investment plans with a Pakistani internet service provider to improve and expand the broadband fibre network. On the back of online sales growth, the logistics and delivery sector is also expected to expand and modernise. Overall, we expect e-commerce sales to grow steadily, although the limited availability of broadband internet outside the largest cities will be a constraint.

Economic forecast: Policy trends Pakistan's third wave of Covid-19 peaked in late April 2021, and cases have been on a downward trend since. However, we expect the country to face recurrent waves of infection throughout 2021-22, as the vaccination rollout will be too slow to break the chain of transmission. We expect the authorities to achieve widespread immunisation (covering more than 60% of the population) only in 2023. The government will apply short, localised lockdowns to contain the spread of the virus; we expect it thus to avoid a repeat of the large-scale shutdown imposed in the second quarter of 2020.
The government's policy priority in the near term will be to support macroeconomic fundamentals by implementing reforms under the IMF programme, such as increasing the autonomy of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP, the central bank), withdrawing corporate tax exemptions, increasing fuel tariffs and reforming sales and income taxes. Throughout the rest of its term the coalition government, led by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), will focus on the ambitious policy agenda on which it was elected, including the expansion of social services, housing construction and job creation. These plans were ambitious even before the onset of the pandemic, and a wide budget deficit will constrain progress in these areas.
Economic policymaking will suffer from greater military interference during the forecast period. The armed forces will expand their sphere of influence through appointments and institutional changes such as the elevation in 2019 of the army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, to the National Development Council, which is tasked with setting development policies and providing guidelines for regional co-operation. As the military wields greater influence, its own varied business interests will become further entrenched. In particular, the logistics and transport sectors, which are dominated by military-backed entities, will undergo a further decline in competition. The military's greater involvement in economic matters could also increase expropriation risks for foreign investors in the energy and extractive industries.

The budget for fiscal year 2021/22 (July-June), announced in mid-June, increases expenditure only moderately but is the most expansionary budget presented by the PTI since it assumed office in 2018. The budget aims primarily to support the economy by strongly increasing capital expenditure, which had broadly stagnated in the previous three years. The government also announced a reduction in the indirect tax burden on inputs for several manufacturing sectors, the most important of which is the textile industry. To compensate for the loss of revenue and to consolidate the deficit, taxes on petroleum products and imports of non-essential items have been increased, and existing corporate tax exemptions have been revoked. We forecast the deficit to stand at the equivalent of 6.4% of GDP in 2021/22. The deficit will ensure that the public debt burden remains high and the risk of a sovereign debt crisis is elevated. However, our core forecast remains that Pakistan will be able to service its debt with financial support provided by bilateral and multilateral lenders.
The fiscal deficit will continue to narrow from 2022/23 as the government undertakes measures to expand the tax base, but will nevertheless remain large in 2022/23-2024/25, at an annual average of 5.6% of GDP, reflecting the government's slow progress. On the expenditure side, military outlay and interest payments on public debt will continue to account for a large share of total expenditure, propping up spending throughout the forecast period.

Money market interest rate 8.6 7.1 6.9 6.6 6.1 5.6
The SBP loosened monetary policy aggressively in 2020 by reducing the benchmark policy rate by 625 basis points to 7%. Owing to high inflation, there is a moderate risk of the central bank tightening monetary policy in the second half of 2021. However, our core expectation is that the SBP will keep policy rates unchanged throughout 2021 to support the economic recovery. As price pressures moderate in 2022, we expect the central bank to cut policy rates by 25 basis points that year to provide support for the economy. The high level of borrowing by the government to finance its large deficit will risk crowding out credit to the private sector. We expect the SBP to respond by maintaining its accommodative stance throughout the forecast period (as inflation continues to ease), in order to suppress private-sector lending rates.

Preliminary national accounts data suggest that the economy recovered significantly more strongly from the coronavirus-induced downturn than we had previously expected. We forecast real GDP to expand by 3.2% in 2021/22, after growing by an estimated 3.8% in 2020/21. The expansion will be led by private consumption, which accounts for 80% of the economy, supported by strong remittance inflows. The economy will also be supported by a large increase in government fixed-capital expenditure. Our growth forecast includes the expectation of continued short and localised lockdown measures throughout the year as the government is unable to vaccinate a significant share of the population. However, large-scale lockdown measures remain the primary risk to the forecast.
Economic growth will pick up at a gradual pace later in the forecast period, averaging 4.4% a year in 2022/23-2024/25, amid strong private consumption and fixed investment, which will be supported by the easing of monetary policy and investment by Chinese companies under the CPEC. Strong growth in exports of textiles, supported by a relocation of labour-intensive industries from China, will also support the overall economy. Nevertheless, growth will continue to be constrained by the government's fiscal consolidation moves and its efforts to address balance-of-payments pressures.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends Output from the industrial sector accounted for 18.7% of nominal GDP in 2019/20. The manufacturing subcomponent accounted for 64.7% of the industrial sector, within which textiles will continue to play an important role and account for the majority of total merchandise exports. The textile sector was weighed down in 2019/20-2020/21 by the pandemic and low cotton production. However, in 2021/22 we expect the sector to be supported by a reduction in costs, owing to a decrease in import tariffs for textile inputs and strong demand from Pakistan's export destinations-notably the US and Europe. Over the rest of the forecast period the textile sector will continue to expand, but the growth will be constrained by a number of factors. Garment companies have often failed to adapt to international clients' increasingly stringent requirements in areas such as labour rights. The sector is still stuck at the low end of the value chain, as modern management practices have not been widely utilised, resulting in low productivity. Moving up the value chain will be crucial, as Pakistan's textile sector is still based mainly on cotton, whereas international demand is shifting to synthetic fibre. Moreover, competitors such as Vietnam have made headway in signing free-trade agreements with Pakistan's key export destinations, which could curb growth prospects.
Output from other subsectors of the industrial sector is forecast to increase gradually. The construction sector will grow strongly in the first half of the forecast period, supported by regulatory easing. An improvement in the availability of electricity, particularly in the latter part of the forecast period, will reduce operational challenges, and firms will start to be able to take better advantage of preferential tariffs. However, the sector will continue to suffer from low levels of investment, which will result in the use of old and relatively unproductive machinery.
The services sector will be an increasingly important part of the economy over the forecast period, expanding from 57.1% of GDP in 2020/21 to 58.2% of GDP in 2024/25. Wholesale and retail trade is the largest category in the services sector, comprising around 20% of GDP. Rising household incomes and greater urbanisation will spur growth in retail. Infrastructure spending will provide a lift for the transport sector, which is set to benefit from improvements and investment under the CPEC.
Output growth in the telecommunications sector is also likely to remain strong in 2021-25. Mobile-phone use is increasing rapidly, as a result of deregulation in the sector and lower prices for handsets. According to the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority, the percentage of people in Pakistan using mobile phones stood at almost 83.9% in May 2021, when there were 183m annual mobile subscribers; this is set to rise further in the coming years. Demand for 4G services has been strong, and these will enable many more people and businesses to access high-speed internet via mobile phones, spurring further expansion. Moreover, opportunities for expansion exist in new areas such as broadband and mobile commerce. Most foreign investment will continue to come from China and the Middle East. As a significant proportion of foreign direct investment is concentrated in telecoms, maintaining the sector's attractiveness to foreign investors will remain crucial for the government.
The agriculture sector will remain susceptible to natural disasters Output from the agriculture sector (which accounts for 24.4% of nominal GDP and 36.9% of total employment) will fluctuate depending on government targets and seasonal rainfall. Major floods in 2010 and locust infestation in 2020 demonstrated the sectors' vulnerability to shocks such as natural disasters. Without a substantial increase in investment, which we do not anticipate, the sector will remain vulnerable to extreme weather conditions and water shortages. Assuming normal harvests, we expect agricultural output to increase by 2.8% a year on average in 2021/22-2024/25.

Consumer prices 9.5 9.0 6.9 5.9 5.0 4.8
Consumer price inflation will remain elevated in 2021, owing to high food prices, heightened inflationary expectations, increases in fuel tariffs under the IMF programme and higher fuel prices resulting from a rise in global oil prices. An increase in inflationary pressure will be offset in part by lower imported inflation. We forecast consumer price inflation to average 9% in 2021, marking a deceleration from 9.5% in 2020.
Consumer price inflation will decelerate further in 2022 with the dissipation of domestic supply-side inflationary pressures. We forecast global oil prices to rise for a second year in 2022, but the pace of increase will be considerably slower than in 2021. Overall, we expect consumer price inflation to average 5.6% per year in 2022-25.

After appreciating between July 2020 and April 2021, the Pakistan rupee has returned to its depreciatory trend against the US dollar. We expect the local currency to maintain this trend for the rest of 2021, owing to the current-account deficit, persistently high inflation and the strengthening of the US dollar. We forecast the rupee to reach PRs162.8:US$1 at end-2021, from PRs159.6:US$1 a year earlier. This will be a much more gradual depreciation than was the case in 2018-20. The depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar in May-June 2021 has alleviated our concern about the rupee being overvalued. We believe that this, along with a rapid build-up of foreign-exchange reserves with the central bank, will help to prevent high volatility in the exchange rate.
The currency will depreciate against the US dollar throughout the rest of our forecast period, owing to the persistent current-account deficit and gradual monetary easing from 2022 (against the global trend). The rupee will also depreciate gradually in real effective exchange rate terms. We expect the SBP to continue to operate a lightly managed exchange-rate regime, which it adopted under the IMF programme, and not to adopt a free-floating regime.

The current-account balance will shift to a deficit equivalent to 1.8% of GDP in 2021, from a marginal surplus in 2020. We forecast merchandise imports (on a current-account basis) to rise by 31% in 2021, after annual contractions in 2019 and 2020. This growth rate reflects improving domestic demand conditions after the disruption caused by the pandemic, as well as a steep rise in global crude oil prices. Imports of cotton for the garment industry (to compensate for a poor domestic harvest this year) and high cereal imports (to contain food inflation) will also support growth. Import growth will be buttressed from 2022 by strengthening domestic demand and the relaxation of import controls over the medium term.
Merchandise exports will rebound by 23.7% in 2021, after two consecutive years of contraction, as economic activity normalises in major overseas markets after pandemic-induced slowdowns. We expect goods exports to maintain growth momentum throughout the forecast period. Nevertheless, the rate of expansion will remain below potential, owing to myriad supply-side constraints, including the slow adoption of technology, low labour productivity and a difficult local business environment.
Despite a subdued recovery in the Gulf economies, which are major employers of overseas Pakistani workers, we expect remittance inflows to be significantly higher than in 2019-20. This will help to support household spending, particularly in rural areas. Inflows will dwarf outflows, leaving the secondary account in surplus and partially offsetting the trade deficit.
Overall, we expect Pakistan's external position to improve over the forecast period, aided by the US$6bn, 39-month IMF extended fund facility programme. The country's external position will also be supported by the debt-service suspension initiative enacted by G20 countries and lending support from other bilateral lenders (particularly China). Although the current-account deficit will widen to 2% of GDP in 2022, it will remain significantly narrower-both in absolute terms and as a percentage of GDP-than it was in 2018, when Pakistan faced a balance-of-payment crisis. A gradual narrowing of the current-account deficit in 2022-25, along with a build-up of foreign-exchange reserves, will also help to alleviate balance-of-payments strains.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Pakistan Stocks and flows Foreign direct investment (FDI) stood at US$2.1bn in 2020, according to data from the IMF, slightly lower than the US$2.2bn recorded in 2019. Inflows remained relatively resilient in 2020 given the Covid-19 pandemic and the balance-of-payments strains faced by Pakistan. This is primarily the result of an increase in investment from China. FDI in Pakistan grew rapidly prior to 2008, on the back of increased incentives for investors, improved economic fundamentals and greater policy consistency. However, inflows declined sharply and have remained depressed since then as a result of domestic political instability and persistent strains on the external account. The stock of FDI in Pakistan stood at US$32.4bn at end-2020, higher than the stock of US$19.4bn in the similarly sized Bangladeshi economy.
Origin and distribution In 2020 the top net foreign investors in Pakistan were China (accounting for 39.9% of inflows), Hong Kong (9%) and Malta (6.6%, owing to its tax haven status), according to the State Bank of Pakistan (the central bank). The power sector was the largest recipient of FDI in 2020, garnering 47.5% of total inflows, while the oil and gas sector and the financial sector accounted for 14.1% and 11.4% of inflows respectively.
Determinants Between 2000 and 2007 the military government was able to maintain relative political and economic stability, and this was an important factor in attracting investment. Sustained growth in specific sectors since then has presented investors with the potential for high returns. However, the uncertain political environment since 2008 and the recurrent external-account difficulties faced by Pakistan have adversely affected investor confidence. A key source of investment finance is the Chinese government, which wants to foster political stability through investment in Pakistan's economic development. The prime example of this is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
Impact FDI into Pakistan has been unable to support fixed investment significantly. FDI inflows as a share of fixed capital formation stood at 6.5% in 2019/20, as inflows have been concentrated in only a few sectors, such as oil and gas exploration, power, telecommunications and finance. Overall, the longer-term benefit will be limited given that even in these sectors the transfer of technology between foreign companies and domestic companies is minimal. However, the impact of FDI on Pakistan will be felt mostly through investments made under the CPEC in the power sector, which will significantly support the Pakistani economy by alleviating the country's electricity shortage.
Potential The main attractions for foreign investors will continue to be the telecommunications, power and hydrocarbons sectors. The government will encourage private-sector involvement in areas that were previously the preserve of the public sector, primarily through privatisation. The government resumed its privatisation programme in mid-2014 with the sale of stakes in United Bank and Pakistan Petroleum, in order to shore up its fiscal position. Progress on privatisation over the forecast period will be slow, and the process of reforming public-sector companies such as Pakistan International Airlines has been gradual. This will make attracting buyers for these troubled entities a challenge. In general, political concerns have had a greater impact on portfolio inflows than FDI, but Pakistan's myriad domestic woes indicate that investment prospects (with the exception of projects under the CPEC) will remain relatively subdued.

Population growth will start to put pressure on scarce resources We forecast the population to grow by 1.9% a year in 2021-25-a slight deceleration from the pace of 2.1% recorded in 2016-20. Nevertheless, Pakistan will add 17m people to its population over the forecast period. Population growth will put increasing pressure on scarce resources such as water and energy. The Water and Power Development Authority forecasts that the amount of water available will fall to around 800 cu metres/person by 2025, compared with around 5,000 cu metres/person in 1951. (The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation considers a level of 1,000 cu metres per person to be the threshold below which a country faces water scarcity.)
The government hopes to slow population growth and plans to encourage medical practitioners, religious leaders and private organisations to work with it to reduce the birth rate. Officials also intend to focus on slowing population growth in rural areas, where around 60% of Pakistan's citizens live. However, previous family-planning campaigns have not been markedly successful, and a plethora of other pressing issues, such as reviving the economy from the effects of the coronavirus and easing the strains on the fiscal and external accounts, means that population control will not be a priority over the medium term.
The population will remain young. While the proportion of people aged up to 14 will shrink, that of people aged between 15 and 64 is projected to grow over the next five years. The proportion of the total in the oldest group (those aged 65 or over) will rise slightly. During our five-year forecast period the number of Pakistani people of working age will increase sharply. This development presents Pakistan with an opportunity to enjoy a "demographic dividend" as the higher level of output facilitated by the increased labour force supports stronger overall economic growth. Moreover, Pakistan will not have to combat the financial problems associated with an ageing population (in particular, higher medical costs and pension liabilities) that are facing north-east Asian countries, where the decline in birth rates in the past three decades has been more pronounced.
However, Pakistan will not be able to reap the full potential benefits of its demographic dividend because of low female participation in the workforce, due to social and religious restrictions. According to the International Labour Organisation, only 22% of women in Pakistan participated in the labour force in 2018. This is lower than the global average and is behind Pakistan's regional peers, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, where 36% and 34% of women were in employment respectively.
Barriers to entry in the education system will remain high Pakistan's GDP per head (in US dollar purchasing power parity terms) is the lowest of the four South Asian countries covered by our Country Forecast reports. The figure for Pakistan in 2020 is estimated at US$4,730, compared with US$6,510 for India, US$13,570 for Sri Lanka and US$5,208 for Bangladesh. Unlike Bangladesh, Pakistan has not made significant progress on reducing barriers to entry in the education system. According to data provided by the UN, the gender difference in primary school attendance is wide in Pakistan, at 11.6 percentage points: 73.2% of boys and 61.6% of girls attended school in 2018 (latest available data). There is also a wide discrepancy between the poor and the rich; only 39.5% of all children in the poorest quintile attended primary school in 2018, compared with 76.6% for the richest quintile. Progress in the improvement of education will be slow, partly because Pakistan lacks qualified teachers. Those teachers who are qualified are unlikely to find employment in rural or poor areas an attractive proposition.
Despite the weakness of its key social indicators, development spending will remain less of a priority than debt repayment and military spending. As a result, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects social indicators in areas such as health and education to remain poor. We expect that life expectancy will rise slowly, from an average of 67.2 years in 2021 to 67.8 years in 2025. Infant mortality will fall from 55.3 deaths per 1,000 live births to 50.3 over the same period. The relatively fast rate of population growth will put increasing strain on the provision of healthcare services, even after the Covid-19 pandemic.

The consumer market has been affected by a fall in incomes in 2019-20 caused by balance-of-payments strains and the Covid-19 pandemic. The government's efforts to address balance-of-payments pressures and consolidate fiscal expenditure will dampen economic activity throughout the period, weighing on purchasing power. GDP per head at market exchange rates is estimated to have fallen from US$1,482 in 2017/18 to US$1,189 in 2019/20, and we forecast that it will recover to US$1,459 only in 2024/25. Nevertheless, the country's young and growing population will support growth in aggregate domestic demand. Household consumption will remain the primary engine of economic growth, creating opportunities for retailers. We expect consumer market growth and opportunities to be stronger in urban areas. However, most Pakistanis will remain poor, with limited income for spending on discretionary items.
Outside cities, the development of the agricultural sector will drive much domestic demand; a large part of Pakistan's industrial sector is involved in processing agricultural products, and the agriculture sector directly employs close to half of the labour force. Manufacturing growth will also play a role, but will be constrained by chronic power supply problems. Nevertheless, we expect that a pick-up in power generation over the forecast period will provide new investment opportunities for businesses and should create openings for companies in supply-chain and service fields, such as logistics and finance.
The services sector will contribute more to overall economic growth As the population becomes increasingly urban, the services sector is likely to provide a growing contribution to the economy, particularly in telecommunications. There will also be continued opportunities in the healthcare sector. Annual budgets will continue to allocate resources for healthcare and welfare, particularly in rural areas, in an attempt to reduce poverty and as part of the government's policy agenda. However, social spending by the government will be constrained by insufficient revenue and high expenditure on the military, as well as debt repayments. Such military spending may offer opportunities for firms in the armaments sector, although the risk of technology leakage will probably deter suppliers from offering more advanced military equipment.
While the country will face an increase in the poverty rate in the short term (as shown by the fall in income), we expect a slow decline to take hold from 2021 onwards. Nevertheless, poverty in rural areas (which account for the majority of the population) will remain widespread and will constrain demand for big-ticket consumer goods in these areas. According to the World Bank, poverty in urban areas affected 18% of the overall population in 2018 (latest available data), while the level in rural areas stood at 36%. A wide divergence in income across Pakistan will also contribute to differences in consumption patterns. We expect the provinces of Sindh and Punjab to pace ahead, while Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain characterised by widespread poverty.

The consumption basket will remain largely unchanged in 2021-25. Pakistan's low level of development and low average income ensure that consumer expenditure in 2021-25 will be dominated by food, housing and fuel. The low levels of average income reflect the fact that half of the population is reliant for employment on the agriculture sector, which we expect to grow at a relatively slow pace in 2021-25. We do not anticipate a significant shift in consumption patterns over the forecast period. Spending on food, beverages and tobacco will continue to account for the largest share of overall spending. This will be supported by the fact that consumers are likely to continue to prioritise spending on essential items over non-essential items at the start of the forecast period, as per capita income remains depressed compared to 2017/18. Changes in consumption among Pakistan's elite make little impact on overall expenditure. We expect spending on food, beverages and tobacco, combined with housing and fuel, to remain largely the same as a percentage of total household spending, edging up from 69.5% in 2021 to 69.9% in 2025. Spending on leisure and education will remain steady over the forecast period even as incomes recover slowly. Spending on healthcare will also remain steady as the government makes some progress on the public health infrastructure.

Initial conditions: Political and social instability has long held back economic development, undermined democratic institutions and weakened the judiciary. The military influence over civilian administrations has historically been strong and there is little sign that the armed forces will desist from driving a number of key policy areas, including foreign affairs and national security. There have been a number of military coups; the most recent was in 1999, when the army chief, Pervez Musharraf, ousted the then prime minister, Nawaz Sharif. Economic growth was strong under Mr Musharraf, but public protests prompted a return to democracy (and a parliamentary election) in 2008.
The country's first transition of power between two democratically elected governments occurred in 2013, when Mr Sharif once again assumed power. In a positive move, in 2016 General Qamar Javed Bajwa replaced General Raheel Sharif as the chief of army staff-the first time in 20 years that an army chief in Pakistan had ended a single three-year term as planned. However, tensions were heightened between the government-led at the time by the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz)-on one side and the military and judiciary on the other. These tensions have persisted even since the administration was ousted from power in July 2018.
Ties between the military and the current civilian government, led by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, are positive, but institutional stability will continue to come under strain as opposition parties push for a more impartial and non-partisan judiciary and military. Although Pakistan entered an IMF programme in July 2019, which will help to counter the ongoing balance-of-payments and fiscal difficulties, meaningful structural reforms that could put the country on a fast and sustainable macroeconomic trajectory will be rare.
Demographic trends: Pakistan's population is forecast to grow fairly rapidly. At the current growth rate, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects it to reach around 338m by 2050, compared with an estimated 225m in 2021. In theory, the country's favourable demographic trends will be conducive to rapid GDP growth, but unemployment and weak labour productivity will constrain growth. Previous governments have not planned adequately for the expansion of the labour force, failing to spend enough on infrastructure, education and social services. Successive administrations are likely to increase development spending in the long-term forecast period, but the process will be hampered by limited revenue and challenges in ensuring that increased development funding results in improved outcomes. The need for improvements in infrastructure, education and social services, combined with the low participation rate of women in the labour force (even by regional standards), will limit Pakistan's ability to benefit from its demographic dividend over the longer term.
External conditions: Pakistan's economic outlook will be shaped increasingly by financial and technical support from China. The two countries share deep and long-standing ties in both the military and civilian spheres. China will remain keen to reinforce its influence in the region by funding infrastructure projects under the multi-billion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). These projects will bind the two countries closer together, with the Pakistani military particularly keen to deepen this relationship.
The dispute over Kashmir will inhibit trade with India Pakistan's ties with the US will remain complex. Successive US administrations will be reluctant to cede influence to China. However, the US is likely to prioritise ties with India, weakening its co-operation with Pakistan in the process. Still, owing to the need to create sufficient employment opportunities, Pakistan will seek to deepen trade ties with Western countries in the coming decades. Shared economic interests between Pakistan and India would have the potential to bolster growth in Pakistan if they were to result in trade liberalisation. However, in the light of the intractable territorial dispute between the two neighbours over Kashmir, as well as other issues such as cross-border terrorism, there will only be limited progress in this area in the next two decades or so.
Institutions and policy trends: Notwithstanding the grim current state of democratic freedoms and processes, Pakistan's democratic institutions are likely to become gradually more entrenched in the long term. However, the overall institutional and policy outlook for Pakistan will remain highly volatile, given the strong role of the armed forces. The military is not expected to relinquish control over its key interests and policy areas such as national security or foreign affairs for at least another decade. On the positive side, since 1999 Pakistan has made some progress on economic and structural reforms. However, the country's volatile political situation affects the quality of its underlying institutions and will determine the policies that are adopted.
Improved management and technology will enhance institutional strength Institutions and policy will improve slowly as civil servants and economists continue to strengthen their management and technology skills. Engagement with the IMF in 2019-23 will help the authorities to make some progress on key areas of reform, including privatisation, revenue collection and the move towards a more lightly managed exchange-rate regime. However, significant structural reforms will be hard to come by as the momentum of reform dwindles once the IMF programme ends. Similar engagements with other multilateral institutions will result in the same back-and-forth incremental progress on reform over the next few decades.
Long-term performance: Pakistan's labour force will grow rapidly, driven by a rise in the population. However, skill levels will not increase substantially. The average number of years of schooling will remain low, even by the standards of developing countries. It has taken nearly three decades for Pakistan to increase the mean years of schooling to 5.2 (in 2019, latest available from the UN), compared with 2.3 in 1990. Labour productivity will rise by around 2.1% a year in 2021-50. Pakistan's efforts to maintain rapid economic growth will continue to rely on textiles, low-end manufacturing and some services subsectors. A growing middle class and an increasingly dynamic private sector will spearhead this effort. An increased level of sophistication in managing the economy, as well as a gradual decoupling of political and economic administration as democratic institutions mature, will support growth rates, even in times of political turmoil. Successive governments will continue to increase spending on healthcare and education, while trying to contain the fiscal deficit at a level that does not threaten macroeconomic stability. Military expenditure will remain high. We expect real GDP growth to average 4.4% a year between 2021 and 2050. We expect GDP per capita (at purchasing power parity) to reach US$21,495 in 2050, compared with US$39,110 in Bangladesh and US$45,780 in India.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Pakistan is likely to be particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Water scarcity problems are likely to intensify as higher global temperatures accelerate glacial melt in the Himalayas, disrupting the traditional flow patterns in some of the country's key river systems. The negative effects on agricultural productivity of a rise in extreme weather events will be amplified by the country's burgeoning population, which will drive increased demand for food. A Ministry of Climate Change has been mandated to put an action plan in place. However, high levels of poverty and the government's weak underlying fiscal position will limit the country's ability to mitigate the impact of extreme weather events, particularly on the important agriculture sector. They will also limit the authorities' capacity to invest in infrastructure to adapt to climate change. In 2019 we developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth, and we find that the Pakistani economy will be 3.7% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth.
Urbanisation Pakistan is one of the most urbanised countries in South Asia. Besides high birth rates, rapid migration from rural areas over the years has swelled the number of people in and around the urban centres of the country. According to the World Bank, the number of people living in the country's cities and towns will grow to 155.7m in 2045, from an estimated 82m in 2020. The actual levels of urbanisation are likely to be even higher as a large number of people live in informal settlements, as well as spillover urban belts that fall outside the formal administrative boundaries of major conurbations. Even as migrants are attracted to cities for better employment opportunities and access to services, Pakistan's urban centres will face serious challenges-particularly in the delivery of public services and infrastructure. Despite the government's efforts to address problems such as power shortages, poor sanitation and a lack of healthcare services, we do not expect these to be completely resolved for at least the next two decades. There is likely to be growing demand for transport-related investment as the country seeks rapid transit systems to solve the problem of public transport in its major urban centres. Massive infrastructure investments in housing and water are also likely to be required across the country in the next three decades.
Energy demand Pakistan's energy needs are vast. According to the International Energy Agency, nearly 57m people lacked access to electricity in 2019. For those who do have access, daily power cuts can be routine. In the next decade the country will continue to suffer from a significant imbalance between energy demand and supply, owing partly to poor electricity production facilities and low domestic oil and gas reserves. Nevertheless, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has the potential to alleviate (partly) strains in the energy sector. There are more than 15 priority energy projects under the CPEC, which are part of a so-called Early Harvest Programme. The bulk of these will near completion by the first half of the forecast period, boosting the capacity of the country's power sector. However, the positive impact of the projects will be constrained by persistent problems that include a leaky distribution system, regulatory inefficiencies and a lack of skilled professionals in the sector-factors that we do not expect to be resolved in the coming decade. As a consequence, we expect the energy deficit to remain a key feature of the economy until at least 2030.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2016-20) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2021-25). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2016-20. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2021-25 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2016-20 ranges are then used to derive 2021-25 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2021-25, not to the likely situation in 2025 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2018 or 2023). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, to complete a first term in 2024 and run for a second term, but he could face a challenge for the leadership of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) at its five-yearly electoral summit in December 2022 in the absence of a post-pandemic economic rebound, with victory not assured.
- The economic and social damage wrought by the global coronavirus pandemic, alongside the need for urgent remedial action, will help to build support within the ANC for the president's reformist agenda, albeit reluctantly in some cases. Policy will focus on vaccine rollouts, infrastructure investment (led by the private sector) and combatting electricity shortages. Fiscal constraints point to an increased reliance on public-private partnerships for key projects. The fightback against corruption will gather momentum in 2021, as shown by the ANC's suspension of its secretary-general, Ace Magashule, in May, for defying orders to step aside.
- Following a severe recession in 2020, with real GDP shrinking by 7% because of the pandemic, we expect a modest growth rebound to 3% in 2021, helped by low interest rates and higher commodity prices, although power supply constraints, still-weak tourism and jobs lost to the pandemic will preclude a more rapid rebound. We envisage growth averaging 2.7% a year in 2022-25, underpinned by structural reforms, but unemployment will continue to weigh on aggregate demand.
- The budget deficit soared to about 11% of GDP in fiscal year 2020/21 (April-March), but will trend lower, helped by wage restraint and revenue gains from higher commodity prices. Debt risks remain high but will subside if fiscal consolidation plans are fulfilled. Cumulative interest-rate cuts in 2020 cut the benchmark rate to 3.5%, providing relief to borrowers, but another reduction is unlikely. We expect interest rates to remain on hold until a small rise in late 2021 or early 2022.
- After easing to a multi-year low of 3.2% in 2020, average inflation will rise to 4% in 2021 (revised from 3.7%), owing to costlier oil and electricity, but weak demand will keep price growth subdued. Inflation will quicken to 4.5% a year on average in 2022-25 as economic growth stages a gradual post-pandemic recovery.
- Current-account prospects for 2021 point to another (albeit smaller) current-account surplus, before the return of a deficit in 2022-25 as imports regain traction.

- South Africa's business environment score improves for 2021-25, although its global ranking drops by two and its regional ranking is unchanged from 2016-20. Market opportunity and infrastructure gains will be partly offset by deteriorations in macroeconomic stability and taxation.

Country forecast overview: South Africa's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: A post-pandemic investment drive, focused on infrastructure, facilitates public-private partnerships. Challenges include tighter competition laws and stricter black economic empowerment (BEE) rules.
2023-25: Expropriation without compensation, to speed up land reform, applies in limited circumstances only, reducing the threat to property rights. Investment incentives in selected industries (such as automotive manufacturing) remain in place.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: A reworked mining charter offers some concessions to business. A new foreign investment law limits access to international arbitration by giving local courts the primary responsibility for handling disputes.
2023-25: The government continues to encourage foreign investment and public-private partnerships, but resists the full privatisation of state assets in most cases.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: The government implements a further relaxation of capital controls on outward investment and other flows.
2023-25: Progress towards regional economic integration in Southern Africa makes some advances, but barriers persist.
Taxes 2021-22: Despite tough fiscal conditions, the government avoids major tax increases to shield households and firms.
2023-25: Efforts to streamline and modernise the tax system and expand the tax base continue.
Financing 2021-22: Special pandemic liquidity measures are phased out in 2021 but interest rates remain low, before edging higher in 2022. Local banks remain sound and a major source of corporate financing, despite profits being squeezed by the pandemic.
2023-25: The continued independence of the South African Reserve Bank (the central bank) helps to preserve financial system stability. Monetary policy remains prudent and interest rates edge higher. The proposed nationalisation of the central bank is symbolic.
The labour market 2021-22: Pandemic-induced job losses oblige trade unions to accept a mild relaxation of currently inflexible labour laws.
2023-25: The labour market remains tough, owing to skills shortages and BEE targets.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Investment in transport and electricity, led in many cases by private firms, boosts capacity.
2023-25: Private-sector-led investment in renewable energy gathers momentum under the government's long-term energy plan, adding diversity to power supplies and cutting reliance on coal. Rising power tariffs drive energy efficiency.
Technological readiness 2021-22: The rollout of domestic fibre-optic cables boosts capacity and cuts costs. Investment in digital technology gathers momentum, including in cloud computing and high-end data analysis. The allocation of new spectrum boosts capacity
2023-25: Work advances on the Square Kilometre Array-a powerful radio telescope with multinational support-giving a wider boost to science and to information and communications technology.

Background: South Africa became a full democracy in 1994, when it first held all-race elections. The African National Congress (ANC) won, and has dominated all subsequent elections-in 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019. However, support ebbed steadily from a peak of nearly 70% in 2004 to 62.1% in 2014 and 57.5% in May 2019. The ANC feared a worse result in 2019, but the installation of Cyril Ramaphosa as president in February 2018, replacing the scandal-tainted Jacob Zuma, provided a mild bounce. Barring shocks, Mr Ramaphosa will serve a full five-year term ending in 2024 and would be eligible for a second term.
Political structure: South Africa is a constitutional democracy with a bicameral parliament and a president elected by parliament. The constitution is the supreme law. The National Assembly is elected by proportional representation; the National Council of the Provinces consists of indirectly elected representatives of the nine provinces. The judiciary is independent and includes an 11-member Constitutional Court. The constitution provides for an independent corruption watchdog-the Public Protector-and commissions on human rights, gender equality and restitution of land rights.
Policy issues: The main policy focus in 2021-25 will be to facilitate recovery from a severe recession in 2020, caused by the damaging impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The need to boost post-pandemic growth will allow Mr Ramaphosa to push ahead more forcefully with his reformist agenda. A new economic recovery and reconstruction plan, released in October after consultation with business and labour unions, will focus on investment in critical infrastructure (such as housing and transport), led by the private sector, alongside a large-scale public works programme to create jobs. Tackling power shortages by commissioning new capacity from independent power producers, and by restructuring Eskom, the highly-indebted electricity parastatal, is another key objective. Fiscal constraints point to an increased reliance on public-private partnerships, despite resistance from vested interests. A new draft expropriation bill sets clear limits on when compensation is not payable, thus diminishing the threat to property rights and investor confidence. Challenges include skills shortages, stricter competition laws and the perennial risk of strikes.
Taxation: Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a flat rate of 15%-after a rise from 14% on April 1st 2018-although some essentials are zero-rated. Corporation tax (of 28%), income tax and VAT were left unchanged in the 2021/22 budget, but a corporation tax reduction is earmarked for 2022/23. Some tax concessions are available, including in special economic zones.
Foreign trade: South Africa has a relatively open economy, with foreign trade (imports plus exports) accounting for about 52% of GDP. China, the EU, the US and Japan are among its largest trading partners. Trade with the rest of Africa has become progressively more important and makes a large contribution to South Africa's merchandise trade surplus.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability Recovering from the coronavirus pandemic and a deep recession in 2020 will confront South Africa with unparalleled challenges, but the growing authority of the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has positive implications for political stability and economic reform. On the pandemic front, new cases and deaths picked up again in May, heralding a possible third wave of Covid-19 during the southern hemisphere winter (June-August). A mass public vaccination campaign also launched in May, but a range of global bottlenecks in the vaccine production supply chain mean that the targets of inoculating the 60-plus age range by end-June and all adults by end-2021 will be hard to meet. A rise in new Covid-19 cases and deaths in May and into June, alongside bottlenecks in the vaccine production supply chain, underlines the risk of moving restrictions one rung higher to a modified level three (on a five-level scale).
Since being elected for a five-year term in May 2019 Mr Ramaphosa has struggled to unite the disparate factions of the ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC), behind a reformist agenda, but a severe recession in 2020, accompanied by heavy job losses and rising poverty, is changing the political dynamic. After several years of policy fudges to appease powerful interest groups (such as labour unions), the need for urgent action to repair the economy-including by working more closely with the private sector-is boosting support for the president's agenda. The two main sources of resistance to Mr Ramaphosa within the ANC are left-wing interventionists-who will remain wedded to a strong state role in the economy-and the so-called radical economic transformation movement that emerged during the presidency of Jacob Zuma (2009-18), which is blamed for facilitating corruption and patronage under the guise of black economic empowerment.
In a key victory for Mr Ramaphosa over the pro-Zuma faction in early May, the ANC's National Executive Committee suspended the party's secretary-general, Ace Magashule, after he defied a new rule requiring members formally charged with corruption (and other serious crimes) to stand aside from their positions. Given the powerful role played by the secretary-general in choosing election candidates and organising key summits, Mr Magashule's suspension (ahead of his next court appearance, in August), gives Mr Ramaphosa a valuable opportunity to reshape party structures and policies. In a further blow to the radicals, Mr Zuma risks being jailed either for defying a Constitutional Court order to appear before an inquiry into state capture (being led by the deputy chief justice, Raymond Zondo) or on long-standing corruption charges linked to an arms deal: a formal trial started on May 26th with Mr Zuma pleading not guilty.
Relations between the ANC's left and centre are more complex, but the impact of recession and the state's financial and technical capacity constraints mean that the left is now resigned to a more prominent role for the private sector. Resistance to wage restraint will be harder to overcome, but heavy job losses are inevitably weakening trade union influence, obliging the unions to compromise in many cases. Policy debates will continue, but Mr Ramaphosa's tighter grip on the ANC improves the outlook for the key structural reforms needed to bolster economic growth and job creation.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch The next major political event is the ANC's five-yearly National General Council (NGC)-a policy implementation review-which will give a clearer indication of the balance of forces in the party and the extent of Mr Ramaphosa's control. After being delayed by more than a year by the pandemic, the NGC's timing is still uncertain, although The Economist Intelligence Unit expects it to take place before the next five-yearly municipal elections on October 27th 2021. The nationwide ballot will give voters the first chance to judge the government's pandemic response and will be a test of Mr Ramaphosa's and the ANC's popularity. The party would be broadly satisfied by an ANC voting share in the 55-60% range in 2021 (compared with 57.5% in the 2019 general election) but a drop to the 50-55% range could see Mr Ramaphosa facing a leadership challenge at the ANC's next electoral summit in December 2022. We expect the ANC, under Mr Ramaphosa, to retain power at the next general election (in 2024), but with a smaller majority than in 2019. The implementation of the new Political Party Funding Act in April 2021 will strengthen transparency.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations South Africa-the most advanced economy in Africa and a major business hub-will remain deeply engaged in the continent, particularly in Southern and Central/East Africa. Despite a challenging environment, South Africa will continue to attract international companies, including from the US, Europe and Asia, owing to strong institutions, sound banks and its role as the continental gateway. South Africa's commercial involvement in other African markets will remain broad-based, covering mining, banking, telecommunications, retail and hospitality. The pandemic is causing temporary disruption to regional relations because of border closures and flight bans, aggravated by ongoing infections, but regional access for South African-based firms will improve in 2021, helped by vaccine rollouts.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends The most immediate policy challenge facing the government is to revive the economy after a pandemic-induced contraction in 2020, which inflicted lasting damage on many households and firms. Containment measures, initially tight, were loosened to level one, the most relaxed, on March 1st-after a deadly second wave of infection in December/January faded-but a rise in new cases and deaths in May and into June underlines the risk of shifting restrictions to level three. Vaccination rollout is gaining momentum since an official launch on May 17th, which could soften a third-wave impact on health and economic activity, although vaccine supply bottlenecks mean that the target of inoculating all adults by end-2021 will be hard to meet, leaving the outlook uncertain.
The government will attempt to engineer a growth rebound in 2021-25, via targeted measures and deeper structural reforms, although the scope for additional monetary and fiscal intervention is limited. With the benchmark interest rate at a record low of 3.5%, there is little prospect of further cuts, and several years of heavy spending and rising budget deficits preclude a broad-based fiscal stimulus. Even before the pandemic South Africa was trapped in a low-growth trajectory-not for the want of pro-growth plans but because of policy fudges between left-wing and pro-business factions, and weak implementation. The pandemic, by exposing underlying fault lines (such as widespread poverty and inequality) and highlighting the need for urgent action, will potentially be a catalyst for deeper and more rapid structural reforms, including a greater role for the private sector.
Devised in consultation with business and organised labour, an economic recovery and reconstruction plan will focus on job creation-via large-scale public works programmes-and infrastructure investment. The plan aims to channel R100bn (US$6.8bn) over ten years into an infrastructure fund with the aim of attracting a ten-times greater sum from the private sector via public-private partnerships. Target projects range from housing to network infrastructure, and include allowing private participation in the rail network. Facilitating solely private initiatives in numerous sectors (such as mining) via regulatory loosening is another pivotal aim, but the slow pace of reform and ongoing uncertainties in key areas, such as land expropriation, will weigh on business confidence.
Other critical policy objectives are restoring energy security by adding new capacity (mostly solar and wind) from independent power producers, alongside the planned auction of new broadband spectrum in 2021, which will boost communication and digitalisation. Despite these encouraging signs, spectrum allocation is being delayed by a legal dispute, and electricity supply will remain tight, leading to a high risk of load-shedding (power cuts) and constraining the growth rebound, before the situation improves in 2023. The restructuring of dysfunctional parastatal enterprises, especially Eskom, the heavily indebted power firm, is a central, interlinked objective. Implementation remains a challenge, but the political will to act is now stronger. Commitments to the IMF in return for a rapid financing instrument in 2020 will add impetus to reforms in the face of resistance from vested interests.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy A surge in the budget deficit to about 11% of GDP in fiscal year 2020/21 (April-March) reflects heavy revenue losses and higher spending during the pandemic and recession. The 2020/21 outcome was, nonetheless, smaller than the 15.7% of GDP shortfall predicted by the Treasury last October, because of a belated revenue boost from higher commodity prices, alongside gains from an overhaul of the South African Revenue Service (the tax agency). The brighter revenue outlook means that planned tax increases in 2021/22 were put on hold and a vaccine rollout costing an initial R9bn (US$620m) over two years is fully funded. The 2021/22 budget, unveiled in February, outlines a path of medium-term fiscal consolidation premised on real-term cuts in the public-sector wage bill. We expect the shortfall as a percentage of GDP to ebb to 9.4% in 2021/22 and 7.7% in 2022/23, before easing to 3.5% in 2025/26. The biggest risks to fiscal consolidation are a fightback by labour unions against wage restraint (via a combination of legal action, political pressure and possible strikes) and the heavy debt burdens of parastatal enterprises.
After surging to about 78% of GDP in 2020/21 because of higher borrowing and a recession, the public debt burden will rise more slowly as fiscal revenue recovers, peaking at about 87.4% of GDP in 2024/25, before edging lower. Fiscal consolidation will reduce South Africa's risk of debt distress, as will the government's recourse to deep and liquid domestic capital markets to finance most of the budget shortfalls. Debt-servicing costs will continue rising, however, leaving limited room for slippage on either the spending or the revenue fronts. A failure to meet debt targets could oblige South Africa to undertake a formal IMF programme with strict conditions attached.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy Policy accommodation during the 2020 pandemic crisis will give way to a normalisation process in 2022, with interest rates edging higher as the economy begins to recover. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB, the central bank) cut the benchmark interest rate (repo rate) five times in 2020, by a cumulative 300 basis points to 3.5%, to help to shield the economy from the pandemic, and has kept the rate on hold in 2021 to date (most recently in May). With a further cut unlikely, the SARB's next rate move will be upwards, possibly in late 2021 but probably in early 2022, as real GDP resumes growing and inflation edges higher. Additional small increases will follow in 2023-25, broadly tracking US trends.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth Following a steep contraction of 7% in 2020 because of the pandemic impact, we now expect real GDP to grow by 3% in 2021 (revised from 2.4%), informed by a mildly better first-quarter outcome than expected, but structural constraints will preclude a faster rebound. Growth in 2021 will be supported by an improved outlook for vaccine provision (after the government agreed contracts with Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer), higher commodity prices, stronger export demand, another good farm season and the maintenance of low interest rates. Several factors will dampen the growth rebound in 2021, however, including a 3.2% year-on-year contraction in the first quarter (because of the pre-pandemic baseline), electricity supply constraints, weak tourism and hospitality, and elevated unemployment, which will sap aggregate demand. The jobless rate edged up to a new record of 32.6% in January-March. Other downside risks include public-sector strikes in response to a pay freeze, and a third wave of Covid-19 during the southern hemisphere winter (June-August), which would stifle the pace of recovery.
Given that the 2021 rebound largely reflects a very weak baseline in 2020, we expect growth to edge lower again to 2.4% in 2022. The economy will benefit from stronger private investment in response to favourable policy initiatives (such as moves to facilitate public-private partnerships) and from a gradual relaxation of power supply constraints, although most additions to generating capacity will not come on stream until the second half of 2022 at the earliest. Other hurdles to growth in 2022 will be a global slowdown (after a 2021 rebound), persistently high unemployment and still-fragile tourism. Our growth forecast strengthens to 2.8% a year on average in 2023-25, underpinned by long-delayed reforms (such as parastatal restructuring) and the spread of digital technology, but the global backdrop will remain subdued in terms of economic growth and trade flows.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation After dipping to a multi-year low of 3.2% in 2020, owing to recession, cheaper imported oil and a bumper food harvest, inflation will rise to 4% in 2021 (revised from 3.7%), but will remain comfortably within the SARB's 3-6% target range. The primary sources of inflation in 2021 will be higher oil prices and costlier electricity tariffs, although the prospect of a second consecutive bumper harvest in the 2020/21 season will partly offset higher global food prices. Other factors curbing inflation are rand appreciation in 2021, weak aggregate demand (owing to unemployment and income losses), spare industrial capacity and strong retail competition. We expect inflation to quicken to an average of 4.5% a year in 2022-25, spurred by a modest revival in GDP growth, but the level will stay within the SARB's target range, temporary breaches aside.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates Stronger commodity prices and global liquidity injections will support the rand in 2021, as shown by a 22.7% year-on-year appreciation of the currency to R14.06:US$1 in May, its strongest level for almost two years. Being commodity-dependent, widely traded and an emerging-market proxy, the rand will benefit from a positive global backdrop, but it remains vulnerable to any adverse shifts in global sentiment and to negative domestic developments. We see the rand weakening from current levels, in view of South Africa's large fiscal deficit and sluggish growth outlook-alongside potential global tensions-ending 2021 at R14.91:US$1 (revised from R16.16:US$1). On an annual average basis, we forecast strengthening to R14.43:US$1 in 2021 (revised from R15.39:US$1) as markets normalise after disruption in 2020. The rand will remain volatile, often experiencing large daily movements in response to shifting sentiment, although South Africa's modest external debt stock and healthy foreign-exchange reserves are protective. Our forecast assumes gradual depreciation from 2022 onwards, with the rand slipping to R17.4:US$1 at end-2025, although the pace of decline will be close to the inflation rate, implying a relatively stable real effective exchange rate.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector The impact of the pandemic on the external accounts will persist in 2021, and we expect another rare current-account surplus and a net contribution to GDP growth. The pandemic led to a much steeper fall in imports than in exports in 2020, generating a large merchandise trade surplus, which offset the perennial deficit on invisible trade to produce a current-account surplus of 2.2% of GDP. In 2021 a healthy increase in export earnings (underpinned by higher commodity prices) will be surpassed by a rebound in imports as the economy recovers (and oil prices rise), reducing both the merchandise trade surplus and the current-account surplus (to 1.5% of GDP). Our forecast for 2022-25 envisages a return to a current-account deficit, with the shortfall averaging 2.4% of GDP a year, as the invisible trade deficit (underpinned by income outflows to foreign investors) surpasses the merchandise trade surplus. The current-account deficit will be smaller than pre-pandemic levels but will leave South Africa reliant on financial inflows to plug the gap.
Foreign direct investment inflows will recover from 2021, helped by structural reforms to boost public-private partnerships, including private investment in parastatal enterprises. We expect inflows of US$5.2bn a year on average (just under 10% of gross financing needs). South Africa will remain a key base for multinational companies with pan-African operations by offering a range of services, including banking, capital-raising and trade-related functions.

Full text: - At a general election on December 12th 2019 the Conservative Party, under the prime minister, Boris Johnson, won an emphatic 80-seat majority. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to serve its full term.
- On January 1st 2021 the UK left the EU's single market and customs union, having reached a free-trade agreement, the EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA), in December. Although this provides for no tariffs and no quotas, its provisions are significantly less comprehensive than EU membership and have created substantial non-tariff barriers.
- The UK-EU relationship will continue to evolve, with many issues being deferred. Relations may come under greater strain if the UK pursues a different regulatory course, which would entail additional future tariffs. Northern Ireland is a flashpoint; the EU is pursuing legal action against the UK's extension of grace periods on customs checks for goods travelling across the Irish Sea, and discontent among Unionist communities erupted into rioting in April.
- The coronavirus pandemic led to the suspension of all non-essential retail activities in March 2020. After a relaxation in the summer, restrictions were tightened from October, with two further lockdowns, the latter of which is only now being relaxed. Real GDP declined by 9.9% in 2020. We expect it to rebound by 5.8% in 2021 and 5.5% in 2022, reaching pre-crisis levels in the latter year.
- The Treasury has committed to a series of coronavirus-related support schemes for business, and a furlough scheme to pay 80% of workers' wages. In response to a rise in coronavirus cases in autumn 2020, these schemes have been extended to autumn 2021. We forecast this to cause public debt to peak at over 108% of GDP in 2021. The government has announced a rise in corporation tax from 2023, and more tax rises are probably necessary to stabilise debt as a percentage of GDP by 2025, which we expect it to do (at roughly 107% of GDP).
- The Bank of England (BoE, the central bank) has cut its policy interest rate to an historic low of 0.1% and authorised £450bn (US$620bn) in bond purchases to keep government borrowing costs low. It has also approved short-term monetary financing of government spending, given the economic costs of the counter-crisis measures. We expect interest rates to stay close to zero until 2022 even though inflation will exceed the BoE's 2% target in 2021 and 2022.

- The UK's business environment score rises slightly in the forecast period (2021-25) as Brexit- and pandemic-related uncertainty dissipates. The UK's global ranking remains constant, but its regional ranking rises by one place. Brexit has worsened the UK's terms of trade, but the country's strengths-a pro-business policy stance, a welcoming attitude to foreign investment, and flexible labour and product markets-will continue.

Country forecast overview: United Kingdom's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Extraordinary state support for coronavirus-affected businesses. A 130% "super-deduction" on capital investment.
2023-25: Continued elevated state intervention in investment and innovation. New state aid rules implemented.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Continued openness to investment, although increased scrutiny in sectors considered sensitive to national security.
2023-25: Infrastructure plans offer investment opportunities. Possible changes in tax policies to bolster inward investment.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Increased trade barriers with EU. New Northern Ireland protocol implemented. Negotiations continue with third countries. Expected decline in UK-EU crossborder trade. Bounce-back in global trade following pandemic.
2023-25: Continued UK-EU negotiations probable. New trade agreements with other countries, including potential accession to Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) trade bloc.
Taxes 2021-22: Tax holidays and deferments throughout the coronavirus crisis. Changes to the value-added tax (VAT) framework.
2023-25: Corporation tax increase from 19% to 25%. Additional tax rises, such as equalisation of self-employed and regular income taxes, likely to fund public spending and investment.
Financing 2021-22: Monetary policy remains highly accommodative, with Bank of England (central bank) asset purchases continuing. Loss of "passporting" rights and restrictions on EU services trade. Slow progress in establishing equivalence with the EU.
2023-25: Modest decline in City of London's status. Steady growth in alternative forms of debt financing.
The labour market 2021-22: Increased unemployment as furlough scheme expires. Pandemic-related departure of expatriates and sharp drop in immigration from EU owing to end to free movement of labour. Increased immigration from Hong Kong.
2023-25: Greater emphasis on skills-based migration from outside EU may risk labour shortages in low-skilled occupations.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Modest rise in spending on housing, roads and digital infrastructure. Crossrail service in London begins operation in 2022.
2023-25: Increased infrastructure investment, emphasis on "levelling up" regional infrastructure and competitiveness.
Technological readiness 2021-22: High e-commerce penetration and strong research base, but research and development (R&D) spending remains below EU average. Continued high threat from cybercrime and cyber-espionage.
2023-25: Modest rise in public R&D spending. Development of state "blue skies" fund.

Background: The end of the second world war coincided with the decline of the UK as an imperial power. Residual links with former colonial territories, close relations with the US and a separate sense of identity delayed UK membership of the European Community (now the EU) until 1973. Successive governments resisted closer EU integration. Following a 2016 referendum on EU membership, the UK left the EU single market and customs union in January 2021. The future contours of the UK's relationship with the EU are in flux, but a diminution of UK influence in the region appears to be inevitable.
Political structure: The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II. Parliament has an elected House of Commons (the lower house, 650 seats) and a non-elected House of Lords (the upper house, non-fixed membership of about 800). The snap general election in December 2019 produced a majority government for the centre-right Conservative Party, which won 365 seats. The main opposition Labour Party won 202 seats, with smaller parties winning the remaining 83. This government is likely to serve out its full term until the next scheduled election, in 2024.
Policy issues: The coronavirus outbreak has dominated UK politics since March 2020. The government embarked on massive fiscal expansion to support workers and businesses affected by the virus and containment measures, while the Bank of England (the central bank) has cut interest rates to record lows, which are likely to persist into 2022. The government expects to begin fiscal consolidation in 2022, although headline debt will remain high as a percentage of GDP. Supporting industries affected by increased Brexit-related trade frictions will dominate UK policymaking. Maintaining competitiveness in this environment will force policymakers to address structural deficiencies such as low productivity.
Taxation: The headline rate of corporation tax has been reduced steadily, from 28% in 2010 to 19% since April 2018. There are three bands of personal income tax, set at 20%, 40% and 45% (the 45% rate came into effect in April 2013, replacing the 50% rate introduced in 2010). The standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 20% (raised from 17.5% in 2011). Excise duties on tobacco and alcohol are among the highest in Europe.
Foreign trade: In 2020 exports of goods totalled US$399bn and imports amounted to US$548bn, resulting in a trade deficit of US$149bn. The services surplus expanded to US$138bn. The overall current-account deficit widened in absolute terms, from US$87.6bn in 2019 to US$95.4bn, widening as a share of GDP, from 3.1% to 3.5%.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability At the general election on December 12th 2019, the Conservative Party, under the prime minister, Boris Johnson, won an 80-seat majority. On January 31st 2020 Mr Johnson fulfilled his campaign promise to take the UK out of the EU, ending 47 years of EU membership. On January 1st 2021 the UK left the EU's single market and customs union after negotiating a free-trade agreement. The government is currently managing the implementation of a new trading relationship with the EU while addressing the fallout from the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Despite the challenges posed by these two issues, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to last a full term.
The spread of the coronavirus in early 2020 put the government on a crisis-management footing. Since March 2020 the government has implemented three lockdowns in England, with many non-essential businesses being closed. Devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland enacted similar restrictions during these periods. The easing of the third lockdown is under way, with all remaining restrictions scheduled to be lifted on June 21st. There is a risk that this may be delayed if the more contagious Delta variant of the virus, which was first identified in India and is now the dominant strain in the UK, results in an increase in hospitalisations and deaths. The government has accelerated its vaccination programme, which has achieved among the highest coverage rates in the world; more than 75% of the adult population had received their first vaccine dose and more than 50% their second as of June 4th.
Brexit and the pandemic have increased the medium-term risk to the integrity of the UK. Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), has argued that Brexit represents a material change in the relationship between Scotland and the UK since the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, in which a majority favoured the continuation of the union. Support for Scottish independence spiked during the initial phase of the pandemic, as Scottish voters viewed their devolved government's response as more effective than that of the UK government. This has ebbed since the vaccination campaign began; recent opinion polls show a lead for support for the union, although within the margin of error.
The SNP, with the support of the pro-independence Scottish Green Party, has held a majority in the Scottish Parliament since 2016. It made modest gains in the May 2021 elections, which Ms Sturgeon claims give her a mandate to pursue a second referendum. However, we do not believe that these gains will produce sufficient political pressure to force the UK government to grant a referendum in this parliamentary term. Even if were to do so, the poll would take several years to organise. Furthermore, divisions within pro-independence parties may undermine the unity of the movement. We therefore believe that there are significant obstacles to Scotland becoming independent and do not expect it to happen during the 2021-25 forecast period.
Brexit has inflamed tensions in Northern Ireland. The UK and the EU agreed to a separate protocol for Northern Ireland to avoid border checks with the Republic of Ireland. Under this agreement, Northern Ireland remains within a regulatory union with the EU for most goods. Although it will stay in the UK customs and value-added tax (VAT) areas, customs and VAT checks are to be conducted by the UK on the EU's behalf at ports in the Irish Sea for goods bound for the EU. This requires the construction and implementation of checkpoints and border infrastructure between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK for all goods deemed by a UK-EU joint committee to be "at risk" of passing into the EU.
This arrangement has been difficult to implement, and is disliked by Unionist Northern Irish politicians for ostensibly creating a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Rioting broke out in Northern Ireland on April 2nd and persisted for over a week. These protests originated among Unionist communities partly in opposition to the Irish Sea border checks. The Unionist first minister of Northern Ireland was forced to resign, and has been replaced by a more fervently anti-protocol politician. The UK and the EU have intensified talks around how to implement the Northern Ireland protocol, but it is likely to remain a source of UK-EU friction. Despite these tensions, we expect the protocol to remain in place, given the commitments by both sides not to re-create a hard customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and the lack of a viable alternative. However, tensions will remain elevated, and there is a high risk of further violence.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA), the next general election is scheduled for May 2nd 2024. The government has introduced a bill to repeal the FTPA. However, even once this is passed, a general election must be called within five years of the preceding one; they are usually held in May, to coincide with local elections. There is a risk of an early election in 2023; UK governments have often taken advantage of strong economic performance in the penultimate year of a parliament to consolidate their gains, rather than waiting for the parliament to expire.
During the pandemic, the Conservative Party's lead in opinion polls over the opposition Labour Party dropped from more than 20 percentage points at the outbreak of the crisis to a near-tie after several scandals and rapid policy reversals reduced public confidence in the government. Since the success of the vaccine rollout, the Conservatives' polling position has improved to a double-digit margin ahead of Labour, which may persist if the government is seen to manage the recovery well. Local elections on May 6th saw the Conservatives make gains on local councils, consistent with this level of national polling lead.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations The EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA), which was reached on December 24th 2020, is a free-trade agreement that succeeds the UK's membership of the EU single market and customs union, following its exit from EU institutions on January 1st 2021. The TCA provides for zero-tariff, zero-quota trade between the UK and EU, at least in the first instance. However, leaving the single market and customs union has created a variety of non-tariff trade barriers in the forms of border checks and product certifications. The agreement also provides a mechanism whereby if the divergence in regulations on labour, the environment or state aid becomes sufficiently great, the other side can implement retaliatory tariffs to compensate, subject to an arbitration period. The regulatory and tariff regimes may therefore drift apart over time. The TCA leaves several areas unsettled. UK-EU negotiations are ongoing over the UK receiving designations of equivalence on financial services, allowing for greater access to the EU market; and a draft finding of "adequacy" on the UK's data standards, which would allow the free flow of data. The UK has applied to rejoin the Lugano convention, which allows legal judgments to be enforced across borders, but this is also opposed by several EU member states.
The UK government has stated its intention to be outward looking, pursuing a "Global Britain" strategy, and in March it unveiled an updated defence and security policy outlining a strategy of greater engagement in Asia, in addition to continued engagement in the Atlantic. The UK holds the presidency of the G7 group of nations in 2021 and will host the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow in November. It intends to use these platforms to take an enhanced role in global climate change policy. On trade, the UK has achieved continuity agreements with most countries that had agreements with the EU, and has applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a trade bloc of 11 Pacific nations.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends Even before the pandemic, the UK faced significant economic policy challenges, including low public investment, wide regional disparities, high housing costs and chronically low productivity growth. However, the scale of the disruption caused by the virus is likely to dominate the government's policy focus at least until GDP returns to its pre-crisis level, which we forecast will occur in 2022.
Since becoming the Conservative Party leader and prime minister, Mr Johnson has advocated greater public-sector investment, including in infrastructure, and additional current spending on the National Health Service, education and the police. The government has also reformed the UK's immigration system to emphasise skilled labour. Long-term social care is an area of health spending that Mr Johnson's manifesto pledged to address, alongside significant investment in green and renewable energy as part of a green recovery plan, although details for both remain vague. The government is also attempting to encourage public and private investment to address the UK's chronic low productivity, most prominently in a two-year tax "super-deduction" allowing companies to write off tax up to 130% of the value of their capital investment in 2021-23, as well as expanding the scope of public borrowing for investment from 2% of GDP to 3%. These initiatives are likely to yield modest benefits, but the UK's deficits in investment and productivity are long-standing issues and will not be reversed within a single parliamentary term.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy At the outbreak of the pandemic, the government enforced nationwide shutdowns and developed financial support packages to help workers and businesses. These included government-backstopped loans; several business tax deferments and holidays; targeted aid to the worst-affected sectors, such as travel and retail; and wage support schemes for salaried and self-employed workers. In its March budget, the government committed to extending most pandemic support measures into the autumn of 2021, only completely phasing them out by March 2022. We expect that this will lead to a fiscal deficit of 11.5% of GDP in 2021, with the debt/GDP ratio peaking at over 108%.
The budget also committed to greater fiscal consolidation, with a planned increase in corporation tax from 19% to 25% in 2023. However, this budget assumes highly ambitious increases in productivity growth and minimal increases in health, education and welfare spending from pre-pandemic levels after 2022; this is unlikely, given the government's campaign promises of greater spending and investment. We therefore expect further tax increases during the forecast period, with debt declining only marginally, to 107% of GDP, and stabilising at that level in 2022-25.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy On March 19th 2020 the Bank of England (BoE, the central bank) cut its main rate to 0.1%-its lowest ever level. It also resumed its quantitative easing programme, committing to £450bn (US$620bn) in asset purchases, which was expanded twice more in 2020, reaching a total of £895bn. From April 2020 until the end of that year, the BoE allowed the government access to its overdraft account, the so-called Ways and Means facility, to directly finance day-to-day costs, although this facility was not tapped.
Despite a recent uptick in inflation, we do not expect the BoE to raise rates before mid-2022. The BoE has expressed a view that inflation stemming from the reopening of the economy is likely to be transitory. A premature tightening would pose significant risks to the debt sustainability of UK corporates that have borrowed heavily during the pandemic and also the UK government.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth The pandemic and ensuing public health measures caused a severe economic contraction in 2020, with real GDP shrinking by 9.9%. The most recent lockdown resulted in a contraction of 1.5% in the first quarter of 2021. A significant bounce-back is likely from the second quarter as restrictions are lifted and government incentives to boost investment kick in; we expect growth of 5.8% in 2021 as a whole. We forecast further catch-up growth of 5.5% in 2022, which looks set to be the first full year without social-distancing restrictions; GDP should return to its pre-crisis level during the first half of 2022. Most of the headline growth will stem from favourable year-on-year comparisons with the 2020-21 lockdowns as shut-down activities restart, rather than from robust new economic activity. In 2023-25 we expect the rate of expansion to slow, averaging 1.7% per year, as taxes rise and catch-up growth abates.
Unemployment rose in 2020 as the pandemic led to business failures and lay-offs. The spike in unemployment was modest, however, with an average rate of 4.5% in 2020, owing to the government's furlough scheme. We expect the rate to average 5.2% in 2021 as the scheme is withdrawn. Unemployment will decline thereafter, reaching 4% in 2024-25.
Gross capital formation declined sharply in 2020 as the highly uncertain global business environment depressed investment. We expect a significant bounce-back in investment growth in 2021-22, driven in part by the government's investment tax super-deduction, as well as by a more stable post-pandemic and post-Brexit investment environment. Investment growth should stabilise from 2023 until the end of the forecast period.
Export and import growth turned sharply negative in 2020 as global demand collapsed and coronavirus-related travel restrictions persisted. We expect growth to bounce back in 2021-22, but Brexit-related disruption will restrict the pace of expansion.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation Inflation declined sharply in 2020, to an average of only 1%, as the pandemic depressed demand. Prices have begun to rebound sharply in 2021, owing to increased consumer spending, as well as supply constraints both in the domestic market and internationally, which we expect to drive up inflation to an average of 3% in 2021 and 2.6% in 2022. From 2023 inflation will decline to a more modest level as pent-up demand is exhausted, stabilising at 1.8% by 2025.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates The value of sterling has been volatile in recent years owing to political uncertainty related to Brexit and the pandemic, as well as the UK's large current-account deficit, which requires significant international capital investment to support the currency. Sterling has strengthened against the US dollar in late 2020 and early 2021 as the uncertainty around a potential no-deal Brexit ended and a flight to safety in dollar liquidity gradually unwound, with sterling reaching US$1.42:£1 in June 2021. Sterling has similarly begun to appreciate against the euro in 2021 as Brexit uncertainty dissipates and the UK economy unlocks more rapidly.
Sterling should continue to appreciate against the euro this year, rising from EUR1.08:£1 at end-2020 to EUR1.19:£1 by end-2021. We expect it to stabilise against the euro from mid-2022, averaging EUR1:21:£1 in 2022-25; both currencies will appreciate modestly against the dollar during this period as demand for the safe-haven currency decreases, with sterling reaching US$1.46:£1 by end-2025.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector The coronavirus outbreak caused a sharp fall in global trade as demand declined, travel was disrupted and global supply chains were compromised by national lockdowns. The UK was not exempt from this, with both imports and exports declining sharply in 2020. From 2021 we expect trade to rebound, although this will primarily be the result of a recovery from the 2020 base year, and we expect Brexit to weigh on exports (as well as imports, but to a lesser extent). Most catch-up growth in trade, particularly in exports, will be likely to take place in 2022 as global markets fully unlock and UK firms become more experienced in exporting under new trading rules. The UK has run a persistent current-account deficit since 1985. We expect the deficit to widen from 3.5% of GDP in 2020 to 4.5% of GDP in 2021 as the export sector is weakened by worse terms of trade with the EU, before stabilising thereafter.

Full text: - Promises by the government to tackle corruption, improve stability and boost living standards will largely not be fulfilled. The economic scar left by a recession in 2020 will be identifiable in high levels of unemployment (at 33% by end-2020), lower GDP per capita in US dollar purchasing power parity terms, and a breakdown of law and order in many regions as widespread poverty encourages the expansion of criminal gangs and terror groups. The government has a miniscule footprint in many parts of Nigeria, which has become an unsustainable model. Non-oil tax rises are unavoidable, but the revenue/GDP ratio will remain among the world's lowest, in turn anchoring public investment and the provision of basic services. High levels of unemployment will combine with the country's ethnic and religious divisions to ignite outbreaks of serious violence. Nonetheless, Nigeria has a high tolerance for political instability, mainly because much of it is localised and away from key cities. There is little significant threat to the government's position outside of election seasons.

- The business environment in Nigeria is expected to deteriorate during the forecast period (2021-25), compared with the previous five years. Systemic problems in infrastructure and the labour market mean that Nigeria remains near the bottom of the global business environment rankings for 2021-25, at 78th out of the 82 countries assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit. On a regional basis, Nigeria is ranked 14th out of 17 countries for 2021-25, down from 12th in 2016-20 as the country stalls behind emerging-market peers. Efforts to create a more attractive business environment are not expected to deliver lasting results, owing to parliamentary divisions (which reflect societal divisions more widely); corruption; a legacy of market distortions, which are too entrenched and widespread to be undone without unpalatable price corrections; and the absence of effective government institutions and a lack of civil service capacity.

- We expect real GDP to return to growth in 2021, but only, marginally given high inflation, limited credit growth, foreign-exchange illiquidity and rampant instability. High inflation is the product of interventionist policies by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), such as currency restrictions, which has untethered price expectations. This will need to be dealt with in later years by means of tightening, preventing monetary policy from propelling faster growth, and the government will need to repair the fiscal damage wrought by the downturn in 2020. Tax hikes are likely, which will fall mainly on consumers as the government attempts to lure foreign investment into the oil sector. In the medium term we do expect some improvement in macroeconomic conditions, predicated on higher oil prices and eventual exchange-rate stability controlling inflation.

- At an average of 2.5% a year in 2021-25, Nigeria's population growth rate will remain high enough to retain a relatively stable age profile. However, the formal economy will not grow quickly enough to provide the employment needed to absorb 3.1% annual growth in the working-age population. This will limit the population dividend and jeopardise attempts to reduce poverty and instability.

- Nigeria remains an important market for many multinationals because of its abundant natural resources and the size of its population (the largest in Africa), despite the very low level of income on average. In absolute terms, Nigeria has more people in extreme poverty than any other country in the world. However, the wealthy elite and middle class-concentrated in major cities such as Lagos-have typically comprised important submarkets. Nigeria has the potential to be a profitable market for multinational companies that know how to operate in its complex and chaotic regulatory environment and can overcome the logistical difficulties posed by the almost non-existent infrastructure.

- We expect Nigeria's real GDP growth rate to be quicker in 2031-50 than in 2020-30, as growth over the next ten years will be dragged down by recession in 2020 (the deepest since the 1980s) and a slow recovery in 2021. However, reforms to improve the business environment and increase investor confidence are unlikely to be sufficient to promote fundamental diversification of the economy, meaning that Nigeria will remain dependent on the oil and gas sector over the long term, exposing Nigeria to the pursuit of decarbonisation strategies by oil majors.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960, and multiparty democracy was restored in 1999 after a protracted period of military rule. The first two presidential elections (in 1999 and 2003) were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari in 2015, and Mr Buhari secured a second term in early 2019.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties predominate. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the predominant political force, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015 and secure re-election in 2019.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. The government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is a contentious issue, with important subsidy programmes hinging on an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty, but are expected to be approved in 2021. Most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take very small as a share of GDP. As oil prices and output will be lower in 2021-25 than in 2010-14, and as the economy is now far larger, it is likely that amendments to consumer taxes will be made, specifically in value-added tax (VAT, currently 7.5%).
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil, but in recent years (owing to limited productivity) earnings from crude have been insufficient to provide adequate foreign exchange for the rest of the economy. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by massive infrastructure deficiencies and currency overvaluation.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Muhammadu Buhari-a former military dictator turned civilian politician-first became president in 2015 and won a second four-year term in office in February 2019. Mr Buhari's ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) also retained a majority in both houses. The ascendancy to power of Mr Buhari and the APC in 2015 ended the period of domination of politics by the People's Democratic Party (PDP), which had begun at the start of civilian rule in 1999. The PDP's support is now concentrated in the country's south, with the north being a stronghold of Mr Buhari. The cabinet must contain representatives from each of Nigeria's 36 states, although very few are elected politicians. Governance by Mr Buhari and his ministers are scrutinised by an elected bicameral National Assembly. State governments enjoy considerable fiscal and policy autonomy under governors and elected state assemblies.
The cracks in the APC are expected to widen ahead of the 2023 election The APC is far from a united entity, however. It is an amalgamation of the three largest former opposition parties and a faction of a fourth (all with separate geographic and ethnic power bases, as well as varying ideologies), together with PDP defectors. Political appointments have therefore been based in numerous instances on distributing power among the APC's constituent elements rather than on merit. In late 2018 there were mass defections from the APC, with many crossing the floor to join the PDP. Although in a sense this refreshed the party for Mr Buhari's second term, dissension within the ranks is likely to re-emerge as the administration struggles to turn around Nigeria's struggling economy and as the next election approaches in 2023, for which a successor APC candidate needs to be selected for the presidency.
Political outlook: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the president, Muhammadu Buhari, to remain in power until his second (and final) term expires in 2023, but the security situation in many parts of Nigeria is in a state of continuous deterioration. The president will be under immense pressure to stabilise Nigeria, but myriad security threats will prove unmanageable. The military and police are overstretched and unable to tackle simultaneous security crises. Emergencies will be triaged, with military resources deployed to whichever is considered the most pressing. Our belief is that Nigeria's federal government will focus on protecting "core" regions, such as the capital, Abuja, and other areas of economic or political importance, at the expense of the "periphery"-regions that have been mired in conflict for many years. This system is resilient enough to keep the government in power, but will leave many parts of Nigeria highly dysfunctional. Eventually, neglect of the periphery could reach an implosion point for overall stability, but we do not expect this within the 2021-25 forecast period. Nonetheless, the government will remain embroiled in a drawn-out conflict with two well-armed Islamist terrorist groups-Boko Haram and Islamic State of West Africa Province. In recent years both groups have been confined mainly to the north-east, but Boko Haram has expanded into central Nigeria, not far from Abuja. Although this agricultural "Middle Belt" has for several years been affected by violent conflict between farmers and herdsmen over land and water resources, it is newer territory for Boko Haram. Security challenges will also increase in other areas of the country, with unrest in the south-east attributed to Biafran secessionist groups and a broader surge in kidnappings by established groups such as Boko Haram and by organised criminal networks.
The security forces will be unable to fully stamp out these crises, and regional attempts to counter Boko Haram have been undermined by political crisis in Chad, which has typically provided a large number of troops for counter-terrorism initiatives but is now expected to become more inwardly focused, at least in the near-term. The north-east-particularly Borno state-will remain a low-level conflict zone, and banditry and kidnapping will remain pervasive. Other areas of the country could begin to resemble the highly insecure north-east as, in essence, "no-go" zones. Broader problems such police corruption and judicial impunity will remain unaddressed and compound the precarious security situation.
The near- to medium-term outlook is made more uncertain by the scars of recession in 2020 and by rising unemployment (at about 33%-one of the highest levels in the world) and poverty. Declining living standards arguably exacerbated and prolonged the protests over police brutality that broke out in cities across southern Nigeria in October 2020. The risk of fresh bouts of violent protest will be elevated in the near term given growing security problems and the still-weak economy. We currently do not expect this to jeopardise Mr Buhari's leadership; there have been rumours that junior elements of the military could be plotting a coup, but the president appears to retain solid support from the army. However, if major protests erupt over policies such as market reform, concessions would need to be made.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness The National Assembly is very slow at reviewing and approving new legislation, owing both to inefficiency and tensions between the executive and legislative branches of government, although crucial bills such as the national budget have been approved on time in recent years (in Mr Buhari's first term there were repeated delays). With the APC largely a coalition of convenience, competing ideologies and priorities nonetheless hinder the legislative process, as does tension over spending priorities between the federal government and powerful state governors. Vested political interests, inefficiency and corruption have also slowed reform in Nigeria for several decades, and these issues are unlikely to change in the forecast period.
Corruption will prove impossible to tackle comprehensively Nigeria has traditionally had a relatively strong economic team, led by able technocrats generally in favour of structural reform. This has remained the case during Mr Buhari's second term, with an Economic Advisory Council having been formed to tackle unemployment and poverty. However, as always, the team's capacity to translate good intentions into action will be hampered by Nigeria's complex political environment, entrenched rent-seeking interest groups, repeated public opposition to pro-market reform and a sclerotic administrative system. Despite some reforms of the civil service-including the removal of so-called ghost workers by the new administration-the public sector will remain overstaffed, highly bureaucratic and largely ineffective, given internal resistance to reform and a lack of desire among the leadership to upset deep-seated patronage networks. Mr Buhari has won two mandates centred on stamping it out. Nonetheless, in practice graft has proven hard to identify and eliminate. It exists as a daily phenomenon at low levels of the public sector, and in the past has pervaded to the top echelons of government. It is highly likely to still be prevalent, albeit well hidden from public view. The perception will remain that corruption is widespread and extends across state institutions. Economic reform is mainly restrained by public objection to free-market policies. Aversion to such reform fits into a wider narrative about governance; because the state's provision of basic services is both slim and often mishandled, many Nigerians are resistant to those contributions that the government does make to daily life-such as petrol subsidies-being rescinded.
A weak judiciary will undermine the fight against corruption Allegations of political score-settling are often levelled at the authorities in their anti-corruption efforts-something that will stoke acrimony and prevent greater co-operation across the political, legal and social spheres. The judicial system is still deeply undermined by corruption and underfunded. This has resulted in poor administration of justice, including long delays in the hearing of cases-aggravated in 2021 by a strike of court-workers demanding financial independence (as per the constitution) from state government, which they claim would avert the abuse of judicial funds. There are checks and balances on the executive, however, and the independence of institutions is broadly respected across the political spectrum.
Political outlook: Election watch The next national elections are due in 2023. In the most recent presidential election, in 2019, the candidates of both main parties were from the north, and custom dictates that the candidates in 2023 will be from the south. This should lead to an improvement on the abysmally low turnout in 2019 in the south, which is a stronghold of the main opposition party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP). Frustration with high prices, declining living standards and perpetual instability will be directed at the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress, giving the PDP a winning edge.
Political outlook: International relations Nigeria will remain a major player in Africa, given its size, but its domestic challenges tend to distract from internationalism and skew policy towards protectionism. Land borders that were closed to goods since late 2019 have reopened, but recent instability in Chad has meant increased restrictions, with only Nigerians allowed to enter the country from Chad. Nigeria's approach to encouraging regional trade will be minimalist, beyond its obligations under the African Continental Free Trade Agreement. The trade pact compels Nigeria to eliminate 97% of tariff lines over the next five to ten years. This deadline will not be met early, given high prices in Nigeria and declining external competitiveness for industries that could otherwise benefit from regional market access.

Nigeria's business environment will remain among the most challenging in the world over the next five years. Burgeoning market opportunities as the population expands will not be enough to prevent the country dropping by four places in the global rankings, to 78th (out of 82 countries) as the macroeconomic and policy environment deteriorates. Similarly, in the regional rankings Nigeria slips by two places, from 12th to 14th (out of 17 countries).
Efforts to create a significantly more attractive business environment in the country will continue to be hindered by the slow pace of market-oriented structural reforms, the ongoing problem of corruption, the absence of effective government institutions, the weak capacity of the civil service to implement changes and extremely poor infrastructure. In the face of public demand for action to address the socioeconomic devastation caused by the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, policymakers will propose radical reforms to accelerate economic growth and arrest rising poverty. However, as evident in past attempts at structural reforms during previous periods of economic downturns, policy changes are mainly superficial with the system reverting to near status quo when economic growth picks up.
Efforts to diversify economy away from oil will require pro-business reforms Although during the 2021-25 forecast period Nigeria will continue to slowly recover from the economic downturn triggered by the global coronavirus outbreak, prices for its export and fiscal mainstay, oil, will remain well below the peaks seen in the early 2010s. Sections of the non-oil economy suspended by the government's Covid-19 containment measures will struggle to return to normality, let alone recapture the rapid growth achieved in the first decade of the 21st century. This will place ongoing strain on the economy. However, the situation has made the administration more mindful of the business environment, even if reforms fall well behind intentions or rhetoric. The Economic Sustainability Plan, approved by the cabinet in June 2020, includes bold undertakings to unify multiple foreign-exchange rates, deregulate petrol pricing and rationalise government agencies within 12 months. The context of a recession in 2020 had sharpened resolve for reform and was a rare opportunity to correct macroeconomic imbalances, but officials have since indicated that their idea of deregulation falls well short of giving free rein to market forces, while the prospects of a major downsizing of the bloated public sector are slim. The draft Medium Term National Development Plan (MTNDP) 2021-2025, which will replace the expired 2017-2020 development blueprint, the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan, is far less ambitious. For example, the plan does not outline plans for a more liberal currency regime (although there has been some progress towards unifying Nigeria's various exchange rates), and petrol subsidies have made a covert return. However, on the positive side, the MTNDP contains land reform, including title acquisition, registration and transferability to establish clear property rights. Developing a more effective and transparent land management system is crucial for increasing capital flows into the housing and agricultural sectors, which have been constrained by the abysmally low percentage of land in the country that are formally registered.

Business environment outlook: Nigeria's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Progress on market-oriented reforms remains slow, given various vested interests and inefficiencies. The upstream oil sector remains characterised by joint ventures between the state oil company and multinationals.
2023-25: Improving prospects for the non-oil private sector are slowed by a weak business environment.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: In 2021 the government aims to enact a modified Petroleum Industry Bill with more generous fiscal terms for oil companies in the hope of recovering some of the lost or deferred investment, owing to the delay in implementing the oil sector reforms.
2023-25: Higher global oil prices and the resulting easing of fiscal pressures lessen the need for a divestment programme. Energy firms remain hesitant to increase their presence in a difficult operating environment, especially onshore.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Despite the adoption of NAFEX (used by investors and exporters) as the official exchange rate, a spread between the official and parallel-market exchange rates persists, owing to various currency controls and US dollar sales by the central bank.
2023-25: Notwithstanding the operation of the African continent free trade zone movement of goods remain highly regulated to stem smuggling and protect local industries.
Taxes 2021-22: Focus intensifies on boosting tax compliance and repairing the public finances without obstructing investment. Value added tax (VAT) is raised from 7.5% to 10%.
2023-25: VAT is raised twice again to 15% by end-2025 as the government grapples with an enduring fiscal deficit.
Financing 2021-22: In 2021 the government returns to the sovereign debt market and capital projects are restarted.
2023-25: Credit conditions become easier for businesses as the current-account surplus boosts savings and investment.
The labour market 2021-25: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers, restrictive visa regulations and poor health indicators.
2023-25: Employers continue to struggle to find suitably qualified staff; unemployment remains high and the market loose.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Infrastructure spending picks up in 2022 more than 2021 as the government phases out consumer subsidies.
2022-25: Expenditure on infrastructure increases, but white-elephant projects hold back the productivity of investment.
Technological readiness 2021-22: Nigeria continues to have a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2023-25: Research spending remains low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

The economy will suffer because of instability early in the forecast period Nigeria was deeply affected by the twin shock of the coronavirus and a crash in world oil prices, which exposed underling economic weakenesses-many related to active government and central bank policies. The after-effects of the 2020 crisis will continue to suppress the performance of the economy in 2021, with real GDP growth of just 1.2% expected owing to recovering world oil prices. Lower inflation and greater foreign exchange availability will engender faster growth in 2022, of 3.3%. However, the pace of the recovery will be insufficient to reverse the decline in the country's real GDP per head and corresponding rise in poverty. Indeed, Nigeria's ranking for this category actually deteriorates in 2021-25. Nigeria's macro-economic environment will remain constrained by market distortions-protectionist policies in particular-that keep inflation structurally high and limit manoeuvrability for the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to meaningfully loosen monetary policy. Public debt is enormously costly to service against the backdrop of a low revenue base, limiting the scope for productive fiscal policy. Moreover, insecure property rights, an inefficient civil service, confusion caused contradictions between local, state and federal government actions, and deeply entrenched vested interests opposed to free-market competition will all combine to keep economic performance below potential.

During his time as military leader in the 1980s, the current president, Muhammadu Buhari, demonstrated a penchant for heavy state intervention at the expense of private-sector endeavour, and his leadership since 2015 confirms he still sees a large regulatory role for the state. The CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, also promotes policies that lean towards interventionism. Pro-business reformers feature in Mr Buhari's inner circle, but market distortions have reached a scale whereby periodic efforts to liberalise the economy crash against the political implications of overturning an entrenched web of consumer subsidies, particularly regarding electricity. The net result is likely to bring only modest policy improvements, and not quickly enough to affect Nigeria's global ranking.

- The 2021-25 MTND, which was released in draft form in March 2021, advocates a mixture of market-oriented reforms and economic self-sufficiency, as in the 2017-2020 Economic Recovery Growth Plan it replaces. However, the ability of the state to rein in its interventionist tendencies will continue to be hindered by public opposition to market reform, vested interests, including politicians seeking to protect patronage networks, consumers used to price controls and large subsidies, and powerful rent-seeking business interests.
- Given the small number of politically connected companies operating in many formal parts of the economy, as well as the existing barriers to entry into many sectors, competition is expected to remain limited. Companies in the formal sector have been dependent on state subsidies and have been shielded by protectionist policies for so long that many are unlikely to respond favourably to government implementation of fundamental free-market reforms. This is particularly with regard to foreign trade, which is heavily restricted for manufactures and agricultural imports.

An opaque and slow-moving policy environment has historically put off many would-be foreign investors in Nigeria. The government is keen to attract foreign capital to augment economic development, especially given low fiscal resources for infrastructure upgrades. Some important steps have been taken to attract investment, such as introducing a visa-on-arrival for business visitors and a market-driven investors and exporters (I&E) foreign-exchange window, which was established in 2017 following a brief period of capital controls in 2016. Although this has helped to rekindle the interest of foreign portfolio investors, foreign direct investment (FDI) remains negligible, largely because of slowness in tackling issues that make production costs in Nigeria extremely high and the enduring scarcity of foreign exchange in the economy.
Various factors will limit investor interest
- The high cost of manufacturing in Nigeria and infrastructure deficiencies-in particular electricity shortages-will rule out a large non-oil export base for global markets. The hydrocarbons sector has typically comprised the bulk of FDI into Nigeria, although flows have stagnated in recent years, partly owing to a lack of clarity around fiscal terms for upstream producers. The Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) was designed to finalise the tax regime, but the process has itself become damaging to sentiment; it was first submitted to the National Assembly (parliament) in 2008, encountering repeated delays. Eventually, after several years of delay and billions of US dollars in postponed investment, in September 2020 Mr Buhari submitted a refashioned version of the comprehensive bill, which is expected to be passed by the end of 2021. The latest iteration of the PIB proposes the replacement of the NNPC with a newly created limited liability corporation, known as the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC). The assets and liabilities of the NNPC will be transferred to the new company. The government will pay cash for the shares of NNPC, forming its initial paid-up capital. All the shares will belong to the government and be held by the Ministry of Finance. However, the company will function as an independent profit-driven commercial entity without recourse to state funds. The idea is that as an incorporated body, the new company will be able to raise money at local and international capital markets and, perhaps most importantly, better fulfil its financial obligations in joint venture operations. Implementation will be a challenge for the authorities once enacted, with politicians from all sides of the spectrum arguing that Nigeria needs to maximise its take from its resource endowment, but it is clear that without reform the oil sector would fall into a state of secular decline, which will sharpen resolve within the executive.
- Of particular concern to investors are joint ventures between the NNPC and oil majors operating in Nigeria. The Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contracts (Amendment) Act in late 2019 significantly raised the government take of oil profits, although the administration is seeking to partly reverse some of the increases as part of an endeavour to make Nigeria's oil sector more competitive. There is an element of urgency to this, with oil majors having proposed withdrawals from Nigeria. The PIB proposes to cut royalty for offshore fields producing below 15,000 barrels/day (b/d) to 7.5% (from 10%). For fields producing above 15,000 b/d, it would cut tax to 35% (from 50%) and leave royalties at 10%. The level at which an additional, sliding scale price-based royalties kick in will be raised to US$50/barrel from US$35/b. Moreover, oil profit tax for non production-sharing contract onshore fields would be cut to 72.5% from 85%, and royalty payments cut to 18% from 20%. While welcoming the proposed charges to the PSC terms, oil executives maintain that the overall fiscal terms in the PIB remains too tilted in favour of the government. The government-being conscious of the imperative to balance short-term revenue requirements with the need to lock in long-term investment in a fast-changing global economic environment-has revised the PIB to further lower royalty rates on offshore fields (to 5%, for production up to 50,000 b/d) and on converted leases to better accommodate the demands of investors. This should reassure majors involved in deep-water production, and some new investment in an offshore basin has since been announced, but it might not provide an answer to other challenges that onshore producers face, such as persistent instability in oil-producing regions, which costs the industry up to 200,000 b/d through theft, vandalism and sabotage. Hence it will be a mixed picture for the oil sector, with investment falling well short of highs during the 2011-14 commodity super-cycle.
- More pressingly, given a challenging business environment, Nigeria will struggle to contend with a global trend of multinational oil companies reassessing their upstream asset holdings around the world, in part driven by uncertainty about the future of the fossil fuel industry. Competition between oil-producing nations for investment in their petroleum sectors will become increasingly intense. Shell, the first and the biggest international oil company to enter Nigeria, is actively in consultations for divestment, although this is predominantly onshore, and other producers such as France's Total and the US's Chevron and Exxon have also considered divestment in recent years (for a range of reasons). Given all of this, it is difficult to envisage any rapid improvement in the investment environment in the hydrocarbons sector.

Legal disputes will also deter would be investors
- Given the government's desire to attract foreign capital, outright expropriation of foreign-owned assets is unlikely. However, legal disputes can easily ensnare investors. An ongoing dispute that highlights the issue is between the government and Process and Industrial Developments (P&ID), a small hydrocarbons producer, over an aborted gas projects has further undermined investor confidence in Nigeria. In August 2019 a judge in the UK granted P&ID the right to seek to seize US$9bn worth of assets from the Nigerian government as compensation for the latter reneging on a 2010 agreement to supply gas to a natural gas processing plant to be built and run by P&ID. In September 2020 the court granted Nigeria an extension of time to challenge the award. The government is arguing that Nigeria has been a victim of an elaborate fraud committed by P&ID, including the bribery Nigerian officials. The country's anti-corruption agency is investigating the alleged fraud. Whatever the final outcome of the trial in the UK (and a separate proceeding in the US), the saga will be seen by many investors as highlighting the risk of conducting business with the Nigeria government.

Near-term exchange-rate convergence is unlikely to be permanent Nigeria remains among the worst-ranked countries for foreign trade and exchange controls. Limited currency controls are in place and are likely to be permanent, while the exchange-rate regime itself opens the possibility of capital controls being imposed, as they were de facto since 2020, with some investors still waiting long periods to repatriate capital, which has negatively affected the score and ranking for the category. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the administration to continue to struggle with the management of the foreign-exchange system in an economy prone to fluctuations in supplies of hard currencies, largely owing to a reliance on volatile crude oil sales. The Buhari administration has inched towards relaxing the foreign-exchange regime with the creation in April 2017 of a special I&E window for trading currencies at more market-determined rates, which is now the official rate, although the CBN still intervenes regularly to guide pricing and there is a wide (+15%) spread with the black market conversion.

- The government has committed to unifying the multiple foreign-exchange rates as part of its coronavirus-induced (Covid-19) Economic Sustainability Plan and the Medium Term National Development Plan (MTNDP). In mid-May 2021 the CBN ceased publishing its exchange rate on its website, signalling the end of the official rate which had become redundant as a reference price for private-sector currency transactions. The apparent adoption of the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate Fixing (NAFEX) rate that is used by the I&E window, as Nigeria's official rate will not result in a free-floating naira or alignment with the parallel market rate. The CBN's aim is still to manage the exchange rate in a "sustainable manner". This will not prevent it from continuing to seek to channel scarce hard currencies to preferred sectors of the economy, and policymakers are not expected to abandon the mindset that views a strong national currency as an indication of economic strength. Moreover, import restrictions aimed at curtailing domestic demand for foreign exchange will remain in place and continue to fuel demand for hard currencies in the black market. The result will be a dual exchange-rate regime, with significant proportions of transactions carried out on the parallel market, which will further complicate the already challenging business environment. In the longer run we do expect the NAFEX exchange rate to stabilise, but this is based on new domestic refinery capacity coming on stream from late 2022, reducing the petroleum import bill, and a current-account surplus, which will enable CBN interventions on the sale side. The government has also sought to reverse a decline in remittances with the "Naira 4 Dollar Scheme", introduced in March 2020 that pays beneficiaries N5 for every US$1 received as remittance. Nonetheless, continued use by the CBN of foreign-exchange restrictions will ensure a wide spread between the NAFEX and parallel-market rates, and the legacy of foreign exchange illiquidity in 2020 will also undermine long-term confidence in the exchange-rate regime, which has repeatedly proven to become highly dysfunctional during times of low global prices.

Protectionist sentiment will be a major barrier to regional trade
- Protectionist sentiment will remain strong in Nigeria, and it is unlikely that the Buhari administration will have either the political will or the ideological inclination to promote free trade. Currency restrictions on imports have caused structurally high inflation, and thus real effective exchange-rate appreciation. This has squashed export competitiveness for the non-oil sector, but the official strategy appears to counteract the impact of this on the current account (and the value of the naira) by further curbing imports and working towards self-sufficiency. Cultivating a new export base is not currently a priority, given this approach.
- The government maintains high import tariffs and import bans on several dozen goods, including many foodstuffs, with the view of promoting local production and development of the non-oil sector. Nigeria reopened its land borders with neighbouring countries to goods trade in December 2020-more than a year after closing them to curb smuggling, especially food items entering the country and petroleum products leaving it. The reopening marks a return to business as usual at most crossings (except Chad, where political crisis has erupted following the killing of the president there in April). Nigerian officials will remain concerned about illicit inflows of goods from neighbouring countries and the impact of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) which commenced operation in January 2021. Nigeria ratified the AfCFTA agreement in November 2020-less than a month before the deadline for endorsing the accord. The government will not rush the AfCFTA agenda to eliminate tariffs on at least 90% of products categories (over the next 5-10 years) and to create institutional structures to eradicate non-trade barriers because of fears, shared by local businesses, that Nigeria will become a dumping ground for goods coming from outside the continent.

Widening the tax net is a priority With the tax/GDP ratio at just 6% across all tiers of government, Nigeria has one of the lowest tax takes in the world. The Finance Act 2020, signed into law at end-December 2020, proposes reform of Nigeria's major tax laws with the aim of boosting fiscal revenue while simultaneously reforming the tax system to encourage private investment, support growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and reduce the impact of taxation on low-income earners. The government hopes that changes in the finance law will help to raise the tax/GDP ratio to 15% by 2023.

- Although low oil revenue will incentivise the authorities to improve their efforts to boost tax compliance and reduce tax exemptions, it is doubtful that the federal tax/GDP ratio will rise much above 5% of GDP by 2025. This will continue to put pressure on the government to find new ways of improving revenue. For example, we expect the VAT rate to rise from 7.5% to 15% by 2025.

Nigeria's banking sector exhibited considerable resilience during the dual shock of coronavirus-related lockdowns in 2020 and a crash in global oil prices. Non-performing loans (NPLs) surpassed 15% of total loans during 2017, but the ratio has been coming down (to 6% at end-2020). Despite this, SMEs are and will continue to be excluded from credit, either through rationing or a high risk-premium charged (the maximum lending rate is above 28%, limiting access to highly profitable ventures). An exception is agriculture and manufacturing enterprises: the CBN operates a system of selective credit controls to route lending towards these sectors, and can point to a positive impact. Credit to manufacturers rose by 22% in 2020 and to the agriculture sector by 35% (although from a low base), and both sectors performed relatively well in early 2021.
The CBN is subordinating financial sector stability to economic growth Regulations in place to encourage a wider direction of loans to SMEs actively put commercial bank balance sheets at risk: the CBN has been enforcing a minimum loan-to-deposit (LTD) ratio since 2019, with the threshold raised to 65% towards the end of that year. The regulation initially encouraged a spell of high credit growth to the private sector, although this has since abated, and the LTD ratio was just above 60% by end-December 2020. Commercial banks are evidently viewing under-compliance with the LTD minimum and associated penalties as being preferable to a deterioration in asset quality, given an uncertain backdrop since the coronavirus crisis began. High inflation is at the same time preventing cuts to the policy rate (of 11.5%), despite flagging economic growth (of 0.5% year on year in the first quarter of 2021), which will continue to lock small businesses out of the credit market, especially those in sectors not targeted by the CBN's selective credit schemes.

- Nonetheless, as the forecast period progresses, greater competition in the banking sector should drive down the cost of banking and improve the availability of lending in the longer term, especially for corporate clients. Moreover, the government's efforts to create a long-term government bond market, as seen in its maiden issue of 30-year federal government bonds in April 2019, with another issue in March 2020, will help with the pricing of corporate debt and might allow the development of a more active corporate bond market in the future.

The government of Mr Buhari has made reducing unemployment and boosting job creation one of its top priorities, particularly in agriculture and manufacturing. However, the risk is that, rather than attempting to make liberalising changes to the economy as a means to improve job creation, the administration will instead adopt a more nationalistic approach, attempting to boost local employment through restrictions on foreign trade. Furthermore, government efforts to create new jobs to counter the negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic, including a special public works programme, will increase the number of workers in jobs that are precariously dependent on scarce government funding. This prospect has led to a deterioration in the global and regional ranking for this category for the forecast period.
Unions often stand in the way of reform
- Although labour law reform in 2005 weakened the capacity of the unions to organise political or sympathy strikes, the labour movement remains powerful, capable of organising paralysing national strikes. Partly as a result of union pressure, the government has been forced to increase the minimum wage significantly in recent years, with the latest rise (of 66%) enacted in early 2019. Although such increases have been required to offset the rising cost of living over the past decade, and should not affect the more skilled jobs in much of the private sector, where pay is already above this level, they are likely to diminish any prospects of rapid growth in the formal economy for lower-skilled and labour-intensive sectors such as manufacturing.

Nigeria's dire infrastructure is a major hindrance to sustained economic growth. Indeed, Nigeria is the worst ranked country for infrastructure in both regional and global terms. Poor infrastructure has been a major constraint on growth since the mid-1970s. Successive governments have failed to deliver on promises to improve and expand basic services in key areas such as power, water, transport, healthcare and education. Gains will be made where the private sector becomes more involved, although significantly developing private-sector investment in many parts of the economy will require politically difficult changes, such as establishing pricing systems that are cost-reflective and adequately allow for earning a profit. For example, notwithstanding the ongoing construction of a 650,000-barrels/day oil refinery near Lagos by a Nigerian billionaire, Aliko Dangote, which is expected to come on stream by 2022 (and is likely be export-oriented), there is little prospect that other private investors will commit to building new refineries in Nigeria as long as petrol subsidies remain in place. The MTNDP proposes the privatisation of the nation's four government-owned oil refineries, but after spending large sums of money repairing these dysfunctional plants, it might find it difficult to finds buyers willing to pay prices that will not entail the state incurring huge and politically unsavoury financial losses.

- Nigeria will probably remain beset by inadequate power supply over the forecast period. A lack of private investment in the development of power infrastructure and the failure of privatised electricity companies to invest more in upgrading and expanding their deficient facilities are largely the government imposing energy price ceilings that do not allow for cost due to recovery. Similarly, the main reason that thermal power-generating stations have been hampered for years by shortages of gas supplies-in a country with abundant natural gas reserves-is that official gas prices have been too low to entice companies to invest in developing the costly infrastructure needed to harness gas for domestic use.
- Under the Presidential Power Initiative, the government signed an agreement with the German engineering company Siemens to upgrade and expand Nigeria's electricity grid to increase reliable power supply to 7,000 MW by 2021 and to 11,000 MW by 2023 and ultimately to increase overall grid capacity to 25,000 MW. The administration has promised to further liberalise power generation and supply and seek to establish an efficient cost-recovery tariff system. A tariff increase was announced in September 2020 and implemented in January 2021. In April the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission said that it was concluding a minor tariff review that would reflect changes in inflation, foreign exchange, gas prices, available generation capacity and the capital needs of the industry. The Power Sector Recovery Programme aims to eliminate government tariff support by the end of 2021, but government concerns about the economic and social consequences of large tariff hikes make it unlikely that it will muster the political courage to allow market-driven pricing by 2022. However, such a system is needed to make electricity production and distribution viable businesses and to improve the creditworthiness of existing utilities so that they are able to invest. Furthermore, the finance ministry observed in July 2020 that the government lacks the fiscal space to accommodate further intervention in the power sector, making tariff review inevitable.

Railways are expensive in a challenging business environment
- After several decades of decline in the railway network, the revival at the start of 2013 of the 1,126-km Lagos-Kano line, after a ten-year closure, marked the first significant result of multiple government plans aimed at improving rail transport. However, Nigeria's railway revival has not been fast or cheap. In his first term, Mr Buhari asked parliament for approval to borrow US$5.9bn from China to continue the modernisation of the network. The administration has since awarded several large railway contracts to Chinese companies to be largely funded by concessionary Chinese credit, including US$6.7bn for work on the Lagos-Kano rail ink, US$3.9bn for the Lagos-Calabar coastal railway project and US$2.3bn for Abuja-Itakpe-Lokoja rail line. Actual concluded loan agreements between the government and the Export-Import Bank of China cover only a small portion of the costs of these projects. An additional issue is that although China might provide infrastructure funding, past experience suggests that many projects will become bogged down in Nigeria's difficult operating environment.

Nigeria scores poorly in this category, reflecting a lack of formal-sector innovation compared with its more developed peers. Patent applications and research and development expenditure are low, and linkages between universities and the corporate sector in the field of technology are lacking. Mobile-phone ownership and internet usage are high, but these are largely concentrated in urban hubs; millions of Nigerians in rural areas lack a reliable telecommunications network. Few-if any-of these shortcomings are set to improve much in the coming years.
Mixed prospects for mobile services
- Mobile-phone subscriptions reached a peak of 207.6m in October 2020-up by 15.3% year on year. Subscriptions dropped to 192.1m in March 2021, suggesting that the market is close to saturation. After several years of phenomenal growth, from only 19m subscribers in 2005, the development of the telecoms industry now hinges on the challenge of expanding services profitably beyond largely urban markets, and many rural markets are relatively unpenetrated. For example, Lagos state, with a population of 12.1m people, had 22.6m active subscriptions in 2019, up from 21.3m a year earlier. In contrast, fewer than 60% of the populations of Bayelsa state (in the oil-producing Niger Delta region), Ebonyi state (in the south-east) and Borno state (in the north-east) had subscriptions, and the number of subscriptions in Jigawa state (in the north-west) was equivalent to just 38.6% of the population. Less progress has been made in expanding fixed-broadband access that provides high-speed connectivity vital for industrialisation in a digital age. According to the latest data available from the International Telecommunication Union, fixed broadband subscriptions in Nigeria dropped to 83,360 (just 0.04% of the population) in 2019, from a peak of 110,834 in 2017. The challenge of expanding infrastructure (profitably) to often remote locations blighted by insecurity will remain a limiting factor.

Economic forecast: Policy trends Nigeria's government and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will aggressively promote local industry, but some elements of policy are contradictory and will contribute to macroeconomic imbalances. An important theme will be management of the naira. Bans on foreign-exchange access for imports of certain manufactures and agricultural goods (covering some 50 items) is being enforced to protect local industry and support the currency, but has some major flaws. Most notably, restrictions are elevating inflation and undermining the currency regime through sustained real effective exchange-rate (REER) appreciation. Despite this, currency restrictions are expected to last throughout the forecast period, with import-substitution being central to the CBN's development strategy, as opposed to encouraging non-oil exports, which are circumscribed by high inflation and REER appreciation.
Faced with hard-currency shortages in 2020, the CBN also allowed a backlog of foreign-exchange orders from investors and importers to accumulate. Because of currency controls and these de facto capital controls, there is a wide spread between the official (NAFEX) and parallel-market exchange rate. Although this is expected to narrow as the foreign-exchange backlog is cleared (market turnover has broadly increased in 2021), the process will be gradual in order to modulate a reserve draw-down, and the adoption of a fully market-determined currency is anyway not expected in 2021-25, and the CBN is adamant that such a move would lead to an overshoot (whereby the currency depreciates) and an inflationary spiral. A pattern of inflexibility by the CBN when encountering hard-currency shortages will have a long-term impact on confidence, and partly explains our projection that foreign direct investment (FDI) will equal 1% of GDP or less throughout 2021-25.
Over time, the contradiction between protectionism and the AfCFTA's principles will grow increasingly conspicuous, but we do not expect an immediate change in strategy given that non-tariff barriers will be phased out over several years. Developing local manufacturing and agriculture is likely to be viewed as a means of preparing for the eventual elimination of tariffs, with currency controls expected to play a role in hastening the process. However, an infrastructure deficit, REER appreciation and instability in agricultural heartlands mean that Nigeria will struggle to acquire new comparative advantages in 2021-25, leaving the fiscal and external accounts and the naira exposed to oil price swings.
Price controls will be another important area of economic policy. Astonishing strides towards the deregulation of petrol and electricity pricing were made in 2020, but the goal of reaching market prices has already been scaled back, in the face of political pressure and now that crude oil prices are rising. A permanent reinstatement of petrol price controls is made unlikely by a new Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) expected to pass in late 2021. The legislation is likely to streamline sector-wide regulation in the process of creating a new, profit-oriented national oil company, which by definition could not be weighed down by subsidising the retail market. The downstream industry should become commercially viable from this reorganisation of the sector, allowing Nigeria to wean itself off petrol imports, with a new 650,000-barrel/day (b/d) refinery expected to come on stream in 2022. The PIB will also encourage upstream oil investment by making fiscal terms clearer for multinationals (the terms are currently being reviewed and possibly revised to reduce taxation as well). However, we do not expect the sustained electricity price increases that are needed for the power sector to become financially sound, and pricing in the sector remains regulated de jure. Electricity undersupply will therefore continue to hinder industrialisation.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy Fiscal indicators

Budget balance -3.7 -3.3 -3.1 -2.6 -2.6 -3.0
Government debt 22.0 28.4 30.7 32.5 34.0 36.9
We expect the public finances to stay in deficit in 2021-25. Crude oil receipts make up more than 50% of the federal government's retained income, and an average global oil price of US$63.8/barrel in 2021-25 will be insufficient to balance the budget.
The federal government's tax take is among the world's lowest, undermined by widespread evasion and a large informal sector. The authorities view value-added tax (VAT, currently at 7.5%) as an effective means of increasing fiscal receipts, and we expect three equal VAT rate increases, taking the rate to 15% by 2025. The first is expected in 2022, prior to the next elections but seemingly inevitable given a rising debt burden, with further rises in 2024 and 2025. Even then, we expect fiscal revenue to peak at just 5% of GDP in 2024, which also assumes that fuel subsidies are removed (costs for which are deducted from revenue) from 2021 onwards.
Set against this, high debt-servicing costs, a large public wage bill and healthcare commitments, including purchase of coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccines, will elevate expenditure. Capital investment will be emphasised to compensate for the disappearance of petrol subsidies, once the PIB is enacted (which is expected in late 2021). The government justified price deregulation by promising to invest the savings in infrastructure and will face pressure to match rhetoric with action.
We expect the fiscal deficit to narrow to 3.3% of GDP in 2021 (from 3.7% of GDP in 2020) as international oil prices rise. VAT increases and rising oil prices will lead the ratio to fall to 2.6% of GDP in 2024, but a decline in average global oil prices in 2025 will cause the shortfall to widen to 3% of GDP in 2025. The government has raised its public debt limit to 40% of GDP to incorporate higher budget shortfalls over the medium term and to accommodate securitisation of CBN deficit financing as long-term debt. We expect public debt to reach only 36.9% of GDP in 2025.

Long-term interest rate (av) 1.6 2.1 9.7 9.6 9.5 9.5
The CBN will fail to keep inflation below a target ceiling of 9%, and its policy decisions are likely to remain erratic. Since a 100 basis-point cut to 11.5% in 2020 the policy rate has been kept steady, despite high year-on-year inflation (18.1% in April). The current strategy is to boost the supply side of the economy and thereby control inflation. We believe this is misguided; high and rising inflation will frustrate an economic recovery, and issues such as inadequate public infrastructure, hard-currency shortages and rampant instability need to be addressed before the supply side can moderate the price level. We expect high inflation to persist, compelling the CBN to raise interest rates in 2022, despite still-weak economic growth. There is a distinct chance that the CBN could tighten earlier, given escalating inflation. Monetary easing will resume only in 2024, when inflation has fallen appreciably.

The economy is expected to exit recession in 2021 as the impact of lockdown in 2020 fades, but high inflation will impede improvements in business sentiment and dampen real purchasing power amid high unemployment (at more than one-third of the labour force) and low wage growth. Fiscal stimulus will be an inadequate counterforce, given budget constraints, and the current monetary stance will put pressure on the naira, creating foreign-exchange scarcity and further undermining macroeconomic stability. Oil export volumes will rise slightly, however, as quotas agreed by OPEC+ (comprising OPEC and a group of non-OPEC countries) are relaxed, contributing to real GDP growth of 1.2% in 2021.
The CBN is expected to tighten monetary policy from 2022, circumscribing the nascent economic recovery, but the exchange rate should stabilise and cause inflation to ease, firming up household buying power. As non-business financial penetration is low, private consumption will recover in the second half of 2021-25 alongside disinflation even as interest rates rise. New refining capacity is expected to come on stream in earnest, boosting net exports (with some output for the regional market, and Nigeria's import dependency for fuel falling). Crude oil exports are also expected to grow as prices rise, again supporting the naira. As refinery output continues to ramp up, inflation falls and real spending power recovers, growth will pick up to an annual average of 3.8% in 2023-24. However, these rates of growth are well below potential. The economy will continue to lack dynamism given high interest rates, low FDI, high unemployment, pervasive instability in agricultural regions and infrastructure deficiencies, particularly regarding stable power supply. A more challenging year is forecast for 2025 as oil prices fall and macroeconomic uncertainty rises, with growth slipping to 1.8%.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends Even amid a lower price environment compared with the boom years of the early 2010s, Nigeria's oil and gas sector will remain crucial to the prospects of the wider economy, dominating the export profile and accounting for about half of government revenue. Nonetheless, despite the best intentions of reformists in government, oil production is unlikely to stage a rapid recovery following a slump in investment in recent years. Fiscal terms are expected to be clarified by a new PIB, which could grant tax concessions from rates introduced in 2019. However, oil majors operating in Nigeria face high costs related to instability (notably theft, vandalism and sabotage), as well as corruption and environmental concerns. A difficult business environment in this respect means that the country is likely to be singled out for divestment by international producers as they gradually implement decarbonisation plans. Sell-downs by oil majors will probably result in acquisitions by local companies or an increased stake by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), but neither of these options will replace investing-power by multinationals already in the sector. We do not expect oil production, excluding concentrate, to reach 2014 levels by 2025 (with our forecast being short by around 100,000 b/d).
The latest version of the PIB includes provisions to turn the NNPC into a self-financing, de-politicised and profit-driven company (NNPC Limited); to enshrine greater transparency and openness in the management of oil resources; to protect the environment; and to alter revenue-sharing. A redesigned NNPC should be better able to respond to cash calls, which the current organisation is in arrears for worth billions of US dollars, and revitalise investment on this point alone. Regarding fiscal terms, the legislation focusses on royalty rates indexed to price and taxing production rather than profits. In response to concerns about the operational risk this carries for more costly offshore fields, revisions were proposed in April 2021 to reduce some of the royalty rate increases implemented in 2019 under the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contracts Act, potentially cutting offshore royalties to 5%, from 7.5% and increasing the output needed to activate higher royalties. These concessions reportedly followed consultation with some investors, and evinces awareness within government that attracting investment into hydrocarbons is becoming increasingly complex given a global push towards green energy, and that Nigeria is currently an uncompetitive destination. If passed on the latest terms, the PIB will support limited productivity gains over the forecast period. In a sign of increasing confidence about offshore prospects (possibly because of the proposed PIB revision), British-Dutch Shell, US-based Exxon and France's Total signed a deal to develop an offshore oil basin in April 2021, although new onshore investment is likely to be far more limited. Moreover, some Nigerian officials and civil society groups have long complained that their nation has been under-rewarded for its oil production, particularly from offshore deposits. As Nigeria continues to run budget deficits and encounter urgent developmental challenges, the oil sector will remain a politically charged subject even after the PIB is enacted.
Gas production could be scaled up if pricing issues are resolved Nigeria's proven gas reserves, both oil- and non-oil-associated, are among the largest in the world. In the gas sector the key issue is flaring; a succession of deadlines to end wastage has been missed in recent years, with many firms still employing the practice. There is therefore intense competition to find commercial outlets for gas. The government hopes to use much of the new gas production coming on stream to fuel domestic power stations, thus easing the electricity crisis. However, pricing remains an issue, as despite government pledges to increase the price that it pays for gas, prices on the export market remain more attractive for companies in the sector.

Economic forecast: Inflation % 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025

We expect inflation to average 17% in 2021, with increases on both core and non-core levels over 2020, albeit a decline from a rate of 18.1% in April. Foreign-exchange restrictions on various imported goods, including staple foods, and currency movements are inflation-driving factors, but domestic food prices have edged down in annual terms, and the government is protecting consumers from global crude oil price increases by using subsidies (expected to remain in place throughout 2021). Assuming that the exchange rate stabilises and the CBN tightens monetary policy, we expect the annual inflation rate to begin to fall from 2022-slowly, owing to rising fuel prices-to an average of 10% in 2024. Foreign-exchange controls on imported goods, conflict in the Middle Belt-Nigeria's breadbasket-and an eventual return to market-pricing for fuel will prevent a faster fall. Currency devaluation in 2025 will cause the average rate to increase again, to 12.5% in that year.

Nigeria now uses the NAFEX as an official rate, ending the use of the CBN window. The NAFEX rate, which was established in 2017, is more flexible than the defunct CBN rate but is nonetheless tightly managed, as demonstrated by a parallel rate of N481:US$1 compared with N410:US$1 for the NAFEX.
Foreign reserves are again declining after a brief rise in early April and the CBN is yet to clear a backlog of hard-currency orders, indicating that the drawdown is partly being caused by a net outflow on current transactions, despite firmer oil prices. REER appreciation is a leading factor behind the external imbalance, and in the CBN's defence of reserves, we expect the naira to end 2021 at N422:US$1. Following this we expect the current account to return to surplus in 2022-25 while monetary tightening in Nigeria attracts hot-money inflows. This should allow the CBN to keep the exchange rate broadly stable. Increasing currency misalignment means that REER appreciation will nonetheless resurface and, with oil prices expected to slide again in 2025, another devaluation is expected in that year, to N485:US$1.

Assuming that devaluation moderates import demand for goods and services, and with global crude prices rising and inward transfers increasing as the global economy returns to growth, we expect a current-account deficit equal to 1.1% of GDP in 2021, down from 3.9% of GDP in 2020. Over the remainder of the forecast period we expect a small current-account surplus. Oil prices are projected to remain relatively high in 2022-23, supporting exports. Lower petroleum import volumes as new domestic refinery capacity comes on stream will constrain growth in the import bill (otherwise driven by real naira appreciation). Remittances from the large Nigerian diaspora should also recover to pre-pandemic levels, encouraged by exchange rate incentives introduced by the CBN in early 2021. This will all contribute to an annual average current-account surplus of 1.3% of GDP in 2022-24. The surplus will then narrow to 0.5% of GDP in 2025 as falling oil prices push down export earnings. The deficit in 2021 will be financed largely by debt, with investment inflows limited by a dysfunctional foreign-exchange market.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Nigeria Stocks and flows Flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) into Nigeria in 2020 totalled US$2.4bn (0.6% of GDP), compared with US$6.1bn (1.7% of GDP) a decade earlier and US$3.2bn (0.7% of GDP) in 2019. A broad decline has been occurring since the partial liberalisation of the exchange rate in April 2017; although exporters and investors access foreign exchange at an ostensibly market-determined rate-the NAFEX (the official exchange rate since early 2021)-the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has repeatedly demonstrated an inflexibility in managing the naira when oil prices are low, resulting in temporary capital controls. A backlog of foreign-exchange orders built up in 2020, and there were still delays in accessing hard currency in early 2021, with the CBN clearing the logjam only gradually to modulate a reserve draw-down. Although the use of the NAFEX for government foreign-exchange transactions since early 2021 has brought an end to use of the CBN's more overvalued official rate, which presented arbitrage opportunities and was widely regarded as being a flawed system, the naira's pathway remains heavily managed, with a large spread vis-à-vis the black-market rate. Our expectation is for the foreign-exchange regime to continue holding back long-term, illiquid forms of investment such as FDI. Divestment by existing players in the oil sector is also holding the level of inflows back, with Shell being the latest multinational to announce an intention to slim down its operational footprint in Nigeria.
Origin and distribution Most FDI inflows into Nigeria are from the oil multinationals. Until the oil price crash in 2015-16 there had been a modest surge in non-oil sector foreign investment after it became clear that civilian democracy and macroeconomic stability had become established. Although much of the investment was by large multinational companies that were already operating in the country, South African companies strongly increased their presence, with Asian companies leading the next wave. However, the challenging market has seen some prominent withdrawals by South African firms and international banks and greater caution by Asian investors. In sum, the initial flurry of interest peaked some time ago.
Determinants The main factors attracting investment by oil firms are low production costs and high-quality crude oil, both of which offset economic problems and political instability. A number of gas projects have moved ahead, and the government is in the process of finalising fiscal terms for the hydrocarbons sector, which includes some concessions on royalty rates for deep-water basins and taxes for converted leases. Meanwhile, privatisation has been a stop-start process. The opening-up of the mobile-phone market has been a success, but otherwise the main rationale for investment by multinationals is to establish a presence in Africa's largest market, which could be highly profitable despite the difficult operating environment.
Impact The energy sector, which has received most foreign investment to date, provides the majority of government revenue and the vast majority of foreign-exchange earnings. However, it is also a capital-intensive sector with limited linkages to the rest of the economy and little effect on employment. One area in which FDI has had a high-profile impact is mobile-phone networks, led by MTN of South Africa. However, MTN fell foul of regulators over its failure to register SIM card users during 2015 and again in 2018 over alleged non-compliance with capital repatriation requirements. That said, the company went ahead with a listing on the Nigerian Stock Exchange in 2019, as a precursor to a major expansion plan, and the tax dispute has been dropped.
Potential With the largest economy and population in Africa, Nigeria is an important market, although the awkward business environment-characterised by impenetrable bureaucracy and idiosyncratic regulation-is likely to keep FDI inflows below potential. Established multinationals that have mastered operating in the complex and chaotic regulatory environment make substantial profits, despite the country's low income levels and the logistical difficulties caused by the almost non-existent infrastructure, which obliges companies to provide their own power and water supplies and to distribute goods on a road system that is in poor repair. The government will continue to promote Nigeria as a rewarding target for foreign investment, especially for the commercial exploitation of a range of minerals. Privatisation will have a relatively high profile over the next few years, but progress is likely to remain erratic. Parastatals are an important source of patronage, and privatisation faces considerable political opposition, as it is often associated with large-scale job losses. However, the failure of public enterprises to provide an adequate level of service, notably in the electricity and water sectors, and the successful liberalisation of the telephone market make privatisation almost inevitable.

The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that Nigeria's population will exceed 233m in 2025, ensuring that it remains by far the most populous nation in Africa; it accounts for almost half of the population of West Africa and about 20% of Sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria has a very young population, with over 40% under 15 years of age and almost 2m entering the job market each year.
Underemployment is more of an issue than unemployment The population growth rate will be high enough to retain a relatively stable age profile, but such a youthful population will have difficulty in finding suitable employment within the formal economy. However, it is not unemployment that is the main issue; few Nigerians in the labour force can afford not to work in a country with no government social security support for the unemployed. Instead, the main challenges are underemployment and low pay. For this reason the local definition of unemployment is working less than 20 hours a week, and underemployed is between 20-39 hours worked. This suggests that the task facing the government is not so much job creation as the implementation of reforms to help to raise productivity and enable employers and employees to upskill existing jobs. Indeed, the country's ability to capitalise on this demographic opportunity will depend on raising health, employment and educational standards, on which insufficient progress can be expected. With the participation rate increasing gradually, largely as a result of more women entering the workforce, the pressure on the job market will be keenly felt throughout the forecast period.
Much will depend on the manufacturing, agriculture and services sectors, but the prospects are mixed. The oil and gas sector will remain capital- rather than labour-intensive, and a gradual switch from subsistence to commercial farming is likely to result in less employment in agriculture rather than more (owing to mechanisation), as hoped by the government. Many young Nigerians will have to resort to low-paid work in the informal sector, but others are likely to turn to crime or militancy-another challenge for policymakers.
Rapid urbanisation will present a challenge A further problem will be to provide enough housing for young Nigerians leaving home. House-building programmes are small relative to demand (at 300,000 new homes annually). This issue will be intensified by ongoing urbanisation. The urban population is expected to surpass 56.6% of the total population by 2025, up from 36% in the 1991 census. This will strain the capacity of municipal authorities to provide adequate services. At the same time, because of absolute population growth there will be an intensified competition for agricultural and grazing grounds in important agricultural regions-notably Plateau state. Access to land has been a driver of repeated conflict, which has been significant enough to interrupt food supply and drive up inflation nationwide.
Weak infrastructure compounds health challenges Although the reported incidence of HIV/AIDS is relatively low in Nigeria, with UNAIDS putting the prevalence rate in 2015 at 3.1%, the country's large population means that Nigeria has one of the highest numbers of sufferers of the disease in the world. Furthermore, there are geographical pockets of infection where the level is above 20% of the sexually active population, and there are major differences in the prevalence rate between states. Other health concerns include the high incidence of malaria, tuberculosis and Guinea worm disease. Nigeria has undergone two waves of coronavirus infections, with a peak of a little over 2,300 cases daily (likely an underestimate). To avoid a meltdown in the healthcare system, a lockdown was implemented in early 2020. However, the economic damage was enormous and would probably not be repeated in the future. Nigeria is currently rolling out an inoculation programme, but a low uptake of vaccines, owing largely to hesitancy, as well as limited distribution and storage capacity, points towards no full or "herd" immunity for several years to come. Furthermore, there have been outbreaks of measles and cholera across parts of northern Nigeria that have led to local healthcare infrastructure being decimated by insecurity. Internally displaced persons' camps often have poor hygiene and are lacking in medicines and medical equipment.

Market potential is high, but the operating context will be unfavourable Being Africa's joint-largest economy and with the highest population on the continent, Nigeria will be a market in which multinationals from a range of sectors (such as agro-processing, healthcare, telecoms and consumer goods) will theoretically be interested. However, its actual attractiveness over the next five years should not be overstated. Extremely low income levels for the majority of the population, coupled with high inflation, mean that most people have little to spend on goods other than basic necessities. Furthermore, owing to low economic growth, GDP per head in US dollar terms adjusted for purchasing power parity, will only recover to 2014 levels by 2023. Nonetheless, Nigeria's growing middle class and wealthy elite-the sizes of which dwarf those in most other African countries-will remain important sub-segments of the market. Nigeria thus has the potential to be a profitable market for multinational companies, but this will involve surmounting its complex and chaotic regulatory environment and over-coming the logistical difficulties posed by the almost non-existent infrastructure, for example by providing their own (expensive) power and water supplies.

As the problems associated with working in Nigeria substantially push up the cost of operations (particularly given low productivity), competition from low-cost imports will remain an issue. Providing goods through imports might seem an attractive option for many companies seeking to exploit the market. However, given the authorities' desire for control over the exchange rate, foreign-exchange restrictions on various banned import categories will continue to impede business operations that depend on inputs from abroad (particularly in agro-processing and manufacturing).
There will be little shift in spending patterns amid economic hardship Given Nigeria's low level of income, consumer expenditure is dominated by the purchase of foodstuffs. Food, beverages and tobacco account for more than half of household expenditure. When spending on essentials such as fuel and food is stripped from the calculation (and given that households also face emergency outlays, for example on healthcare during the coronavirus pandemic), little disposable income is left for expenditure on luxury consumer goods or hospitality. These trends will broadly continue in 2021-25, with inflation being high and nominal wage growth relatively low, particularly in the early years of the forecast horizon. The middle class is also likely to have shrunk since the recession in 2020, and the vast majority of Nigerians are, and will remain, poor. The middle class is almost exclusively located in urban areas, with a geographic concentration in the south-west of the country, around the commercial capital, Lagos.

Initial conditions: Although the hydrocarbons sector accounts for just 8% of GDP (and was only about 10% of GDP during oil price boom), its performance has a major bearing on overall economic conditions, given its domination of export earnings (on which the large non-oil economy depends for imported inputs) and government revenue. Consequently, the lower price environment since late 2014-with deep crashes in 2015-16 and 2020-has severely undermined living standards and the economy. The government's ability to spend what oil revenue it does still earn in a way that would benefit the majority of Nigerians is hugely constrained by debt service (which in early 2020 accounted for over 80% of retained revenue), endemic corruption and the requirement that a large proportion of revenue be allocated to states, which are even less accountable than the federal government and are equally (and in some cases more excessively) burdened by debt repayments. Interventionist policies by the Central Bank of Nigeria and the government that keep inflation high, such as restricted access to foreign exchange for various consumer imports (including staple foods), will prevent concerted monetary loosening. Without fiscal or monetary stimulus powering the economy out of the coronavirus (Covid-19) crisis, Nigeria's growth path in the medium term will fall behind the long-term trend.
Population changes bring opportunities, but also threats Demographic trends: One factor in Nigeria's favour is its large and young population. However, most indicators of the health of the population are low, reflecting decades of underinvestment in healthcare facilities, which will take years to turn around even if the commitment is found. Increasing urbanisation will also put strain on service provision in the cities, as well as housing. An additional problem for the government is provision of education and training facilities for the rapidly growing population, as well as long-term employment opportunities. Internal migration, as Nigerians search for jobs in the urban centres, and climate change and environmental degradation (which is fuelling conflict in Nigeria's Middle Belt agricultural heartland) put strain on natural resources and will add to population pressures. Access to land is already a major driver of unrest in central Nigeria, and this phenomenon is only likely to intensify in the coming years. Overall, it is difficult to be optimistic about the outlook without a substantial improvement in economic governance and policy implementation. There is time to turn the situation around over the timeframe to 2050, but the precedent is not positive.
External conditions: There has been a structural shift in Nigeria's export markets in recent years, away from the US, which is steadily reducing its oil imports as a result of its shale boom, and towards Asia, particularly India. Oil reserves will not be exhausted by 2050 but are likely to have peaked before then, especially with a global shift away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy. Finding external markets for the growing non-oil economy will be crucial, but is not yet on the radar for inward-looking policymakers, whose current priority centres on import substitution and supplying to the domestic market. Heavy management of the naira (repeatedly engendering real effective exchange-rate appreciation) implies the non-oil sector would need to lower wages in order to devalue "internally" to promote competitiveness, but powerful unions and structurally high inflation would make this a challenge. In sum, Nigeria is a long way from developing a globally competitive non-oil export base, and first needs to finalise a coherent strategy for doing so.
Institutions and policy trends: The real challenge for successive governments is to raise average incomes and living standards through a sustained period of economic reform and to deliver a real improvement in governance. However, the omens are not good. Nigeria remains one of the most corrupt and poorly governed countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Considering how ingrained these problems are, they will be hard to resolve, even in a long-term timeframe. The gap between economic policy rhetoric and implementation will remain huge, and improvements will continue to be slow, given that the vast range of vested interests that benefit from the chaotic status quo remain opposed to change. In addition, policy formulation will continue to be hampered by the country's federal structure; even if a positive reform agenda is promoted at the national level, it is often not implemented or is openly contradicted at the state level.
Long-term performance: Nigeria's long-term economic performance will pick up during 2020-50, although real GDP growth will be slower in 2020-30 than in 2031-50, given the impact of the coronavirus shock to output in 2020 (in which year GDP contracted by 1.8%). Indeed, average growth in real GDP per head will be slightly negative (at -0.1%) until 2030. Although some non-oil sectors will perform well, others, such as manufacturing and agriculture, are likely to struggle to become internationally competitive, especially given Nigeria's long-standing preference for a managed exchange rate, which can be assumed to continue stifling external competitiveness. A large market and a continued rise in Asian GDP will be important factors driving growth, however. Barring a secular decline in oil prices, exchange-rate overvaluation will support income per head in US dollar terms, and rapid population growth will cause the economy to triple in size between 2030 and 2050. As the economy leans heavily towards private consumption (with government spending being a small proportion of GDP, at less than 10%), this means a huge expansion in Nigeria's market in terms of household spending.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability More extreme climate change will have a major adverse impact on not only Nigeria's economy but also the country's stability. With the country already prone to violent unrest across a variety of ethnic, religious, economic and social faultiness, an upturn in the number and severity of events associated with climate change will foster greater upheaval. As a large country spanning a number of differing meteorological zones, the impacts of climate change will be various and unevenly distributed. The country will suffer from greater incidence of desertification, soil erosion, land inundation from rising sea levels and the drying-up of surface freshwater levels. The economic impacts will be mixed. Agriculture accounts for a little over 20% of GDP but employs about two-thirds of the labour force, and the degradation of land will diminish its productivity over time and be a point of conflict between herders and settled farmers. Clashes over increasingly scarce land and water resources in central Nigeria have killed thousands of people in recent years and have already disrupted Nigeria's aggregate food supply. Nigeria has been unable to satisfy total food demand via domestic production alone for decades, despite a persistent attempt to reduce imports through various means including border closures and currency controls. As climate degradation reduces potential yields, lower food production will drive even higher imports of food. (It can be assumed that foreign-exchange restrictions on imports of staple goods such as rice will eventually be lifted as domestic supply falls below local requirements). In turn, the emphasis on import substitution currently means that Nigeria's development strategy has a glaring hole by not being future-proof. The political and social effects will potentially be even more severe. Shortages of feed and water in the arid and semi-arid savannah regions of northern Nigeria, largely caused by desertification and drought, will drive ever larger numbers of pastoralists southwards and outside their normal grazing routes. This will drive them into greater conflict with local farmers in central Nigeria, who, seeking greater agricultural production, have expanded their crop cultivation into new areas, thereby limiting the land available for herders to graze their stocks. These frictions will cause outbreaks of significant violence. Nigeria already experiences thousands of deaths every year from conflicts over land access in the Middle Belt breadbasket, and these numbers will grow notably, especially as The Economist Intelligence Unit expects little progress by forthcoming governments on the contentious issue of land ownership. In 2019 we developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth, and this year we expect that the Nigerian economy will be 5.9% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without the impact.
Cryptocurrency could eventually challenge monetary sovereignty Digital and virtual currencies have been transformative in Nigeria, where cryptocurrency use has been found by market research surveys to be more prevalent than in any other country, with roughly a third of respondents owning or using cryptocurrency (although this should be treated sceptically as an estimate of the population). The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has conducted its own investigations and also found that a "substantial percentage" of Nigerians are involved in cryptocurrency trading. Besides being an investment vehicle with the potential for high returns, cryptocurrencies serve a practical function as a means of transferring capital or funds overseas and acting as a store of value. Costs associated with international money transfers in Nigeria are high, and there is also the difficulty of accessing hard currency during times of foreign-exchange illiquidity. The use of cryptocurrency exchanges overcomes hurdles to getting funds in and out of Nigeria, and trading platforms can be widely accessed on mobile phones. Firmly negative real saving rates locally (about -17% as at May 2021) make cryptocurrencies attractive as a hedge against inflation. Data from Paxful, a US-based cryptocurrency exchange, reveals that Nigeria was its second largest market in terms of value between 2015 and 2020, with US$566m in Bitcoin traded over this period. Paxful has attributed the popularity of the exchange in Nigeria directly to practicalities, such as remittances transfers, in addition to conventional speculation. The CBN's governor, Godwin Emefiele, has repeated warnings about the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies and its potential for illicit financing, but has been at pains to clarify that investment in digital and virtual currencies is allowed, although commercial banks are forbidden to trade in them, as they are unregulated. The CBN has tentative plans to issue its own digital currency, but no concrete details have been published. As long as the CBN operates a complex regulatory environment and allows macro-imbalances such as high inflation to persist (which will be a medium-term issue at least), demand for alternative currencies to the naira and the advantages of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading are only going to increase. Depending on how widespread the phenomenon becomes, digital and virtual currencies stand to emerge as a long-term constraint to monetary sovereignty in Nigeria. Even before this point it is possible that they could create a risk to financial stability, if real savings rates remain negative and bank customers move funds into digital and virtual currencies on a widespread scale.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2016-20) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2021-25). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2016-20. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2021-25 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2016-20 ranges are then used to derive 2021-25 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2021-25, not to the likely situation in 2025 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2018 or 2023). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - Despite Venezuela's socioeconomic collapse and the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), to retain power throughout the 2021-25 forecast period. Mr Maduro's position will be supported primarily by his grip over a complex security apparatus and the opposition's lack of de facto power. On this basis, we expect continued deterioration of the economy, sustained outward migration, and a poorer and more violent Venezuela. Despite US sanctions (and their impact on oil production), the Maduro regime has managed internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through its strict control over the security forces.
- The scale of the socioeconomic collapse and the elevated level of political instability will ensure that the Maduro regime continues to be challenged both economically and politically. In particular, there is a significant risk of regime change stemming from a possible breakdown in the patronage system that sustains the security forces' support of the regime. Under our baseline forecast, we assume that Mr Maduro will avoid this, as long as oil rents recover over the medium term, having bottomed out this year. However, there are substantial risks to this assumption stemming from the impact of US sanctions, weaker Chinese demand for Venezuelan crude and a funda-mental lack of incentives for investment in the domestic oil industry.
- De facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding. Concurrently, the government has taken measures that have allowed the official exchange rate to float. These measures have aided price stability and therefore increased the availability of some basic goods. However, the measures are not a product of economic orthodoxy, but rather of policy decisions to ensure the regime's survival. We do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that would be required to resolve Venezuela's economic crisis within the forecast period.

- Venezuela ranks 82nd of 82 countries in the global business environment rankings for 2021-25, having been in 81st place in the 2016-20 historical period, as the economic crisis is deepening despite minor improvements. Reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment are unlikely.

Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Enforcement of price controls remains lax, but risk of state intervention remains high. Corruption and selective application of regulations are common and continue to undermine free competition.
2023-25: Contract rights remain weak, and red tape and ad hoc interventionism continue.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Government efforts to revive foreign investment fail owing to US sanctions and political and economic instability.
2023-25: Investment flows remain low amid ongoing economic volatility. Intellectual property protection and private property rights deteriorate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Currency controls are weakened, but access to foreign currency remains limited. US sanctions hamper trade.
2023-25: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are undertaken on a gradual basis, and de facto dollarisation advances. Domestic supply of foreign currency remains limited as oil prices decline.
Taxes 2021-22: Risks of further unrest and political instability reduce probability of central government increasing taxes. However, municipal authorities hike taxes owing to funding shortfalls.
2023-25: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2021-22: Inflation remains high and concerns surrounding economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2023-25: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2021-22: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Firms prohibited from firing workers until end-2022. Ongoing emigration of skilled labour aggravates skills shortages.
2023-25: Labour-market rigidities persist despite some increased flexibility in hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Underinvestment in water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts.
2023-25: Investors remain highly cautious about committing to long-term capital projects. Infrastructure deteriorates even further.
Technological readiness 2021-22: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment, but with little interest. Local use of cryptocurrency expands among middle- and high-income households.
2023-25: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to restrict internet and mobile coverage.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013 proved unsuccessful. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his own popularity plummet, as his macroeconomic mismanagement-aggravated by wide-ranging US sanctions-has plunged the country into a state of economic collapse.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature to be in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. In August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly (ANC) granted itself control over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly. The ANC was dissolved at end-2020, after the PSUV and its allies regained control of the legislature in an election that was widely regarded as rigged.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise the crisis-ridden economy. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of PDVSA (the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country) has resulted in a sharp contraction in oil production. Attempts to address these problems through distortionary price and currency controls proved actively counter-productive and led to major shortages of both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by the sovereign and state-owned firms. The Maduro regime is now changing tack and pursuing incremental pro-market reforms, but its efforts are hindered by chronic economic instability, a lack of confidence in the legal framework and wide-ranging US sanctions.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the goods trade surplus fell to US$9.9bn in 2019, as a long-term decline in oil exports deepened. We estimate that the trade account deteriorated in 2020, shifting to a US$2.4bn deficit.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV, the Chavistas), to remain in power throughout the 2021-25 forecast period, despite its role in fomenting the country's ongoing socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis. A number of factors underpin our forecast; particularly significant is the regime's strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces. This control, which depends on a patronage system that rewards the loyalty of high-ranking officials, will allow the regime to manage internal dissent.
In our view, the domestic opposition will pose little threat to Mr Maduro's power. Having retaken control of the National Assembly from the opposition in January, the Chavistas have unchecked authority over all branches of govern-ment. Political control is nominally disputed by Juan Guaidó, leader of the Frente Amplio Venezuela Libre (FAVL) opposition alliance and self-declared interim president, but the opposition lacks de facto power. Mr Guaidó retains the backing of most western powers, including the US, which he has used to co-ordinate a "maximum pressure" campaign against the Maduro regime. However, with these hardline tactics failing to deliver results-and in some cases proving counterproductive-domestic support for Mr Guaidó is waning.
Against this backdrop, the PSUV has made gestures in recent weeks aimed at facilitating rapprochement with the opposition, with a view to securing sanctions relief from the US. One significant concession by the regime is the inclusion of two opposition representatives on the five-member board of the newly appointed electoral authority (CNE). Although it appears that fresh political negotiations are imminent, we remain sceptical that they will break the long-running impasse. Although Mr Guaidó has recently softened his rhetoric, he remains firm in his demand that any dialogue should pave the way for a free and fair general election. However, despite his desire to secure sanctions relief, Mr Maduro is unlikely to acquiesce to any process that would actually threaten his grip on power, particularly as he has shown himself capable of surviving even under the aggressive international sanctions currently in place.
Nevertheless, there is a high degree of risk attached to our forecast that Mr Maduro will remain in power. In our view, there are two main paths to a change of government: a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. Notwithstanding the prospect of increased multilateral engagement, we believe that a negotiated transition would be difficult, as trust issues between the two sides are insurmountable. Bearing this in mind, we believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The regime's main weakness is the fragility of its internal finances, which are heavily dependent on revenue from PDVSA, the state-owned oil company. The government's patronage system is crucial for sustaining its security apparatus and stamping out social unrest. The regime's finances have already come under severe strain, owing to the combination of extreme macroeconomic mismanagement and US sanctions. In the near term, a recently announced Chinese policy measure will deal PDVSA's oil rents yet another blow: from mid-June the Chinese government will levy a hefty tax on imports of bitumen blends. The move will hit demand from independent Chinese refineries for Venezuelan crude (which is typically rebranded as bitumen mix from Malaysia to bypass US sanctions). The regime will continue to benefit from funds from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities, but a lack of hard currency could prove fatal to the patronage system, and will test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks and control over the security apparatus. The regime's liquidity problems-along with the country's deepening socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis-could therefore prompt putsch attempts in the near term.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch A legislative election was held in December 2020 to select the 277 members of the unicameral National Assembly. The vote, which was boycotted by most opposition parties, was widely regarded as neither free nor fair. The results were therefore unsurprising: the Gran Polo Patriótico, an electoral alliance dominated by the PSUV, won an overwhelming supermajority of 256 seats in the legislature.
Next on the electoral calendar are regional and local elections (to elect governors, mayors and their legislative counterparts), which will take place on November 21st. We believe that the regime will try to use negotiations over electoral conditions as a first step towards gaining international legitimacy and some degree of sanctions relief. To that end, the regime may be willing to offer additional concessions regarding the rules governing these polls (such as updates to electoral rolls and changes to the election audit process), largely because the stakes of these elections will be much lower than for federal ones. Nevertheless, even in the most benign scenario, we remain sceptical that the regime would allow truly competitive polls that could put its dominance at the subnational level at real risk. The PSUV's control of the majority of the CNE board and unfettered influence over the judicial branch are designed to guard against such an outcome. In this context, the main question for the opposition will be whether to participate in the elections, with the game rigged against it. We believe that some factions are likely to participate-even under unfair conditions-in a bid to make inroads into a political system from which they have been shut out. However, any gains will be modest and will not alter the fundamental balance of power. By the same token, any electoral concessions offered by the regime are unlikely to be a prelude to significant sanctions relief.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations The Maduro regime's main foreign policy challenge will centre on managing its combative ties with the US. The administration led by the former US president, Donald Trump (2017-21), instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions as part of a systematic campaign designed to undermine the regime. Although the aggressive sanctions policy did not produce its intended outcome, it did accelerate the decline of Venezuela's oil industry. Mr Maduro will look to reset ties with the US under the new president, Joe Biden, but we expect little progress. US policy towards Venezuela has bipartisan support in the US, and Mr Biden is unlikely to provide significant sanctions relief unless the Maduro regime makes major political compromises and commits to democratic reform (both of which are highly improbable). Any changes to US sanctions policy will therefore be only on humanitarian grounds, aimed at improving the lives of the poorest Venezuelans. For instance, we expect the Biden administration to reverse course on recently instated sanctions on crude-for-diesel swaps, which the regime mainly uses to shore up diesel supplies for power generation, agricultural activity, water pumps and public transport.
Another major challenge for the Maduro regime comes from a traditional ally, China. Despite having previously extended significant financial aid to the regime, the Chinese government has scaled back its support in recent years, following non-payment of liabilities by Venezuela. China's surprise decision to tax bitumen imports has complicated relations further. Our baseline view is that the policy move was motivated by domestic considerations, namely China's desire to support its state-owned refineries at the cost of independent ones. Assuming that this is the case, the Chinese authorities are likely to permit Venezuelan crude to enter the country in other ways. However, we do not entirely rule out the possibility that China has lost confidence in the Maduro regime. In that case, PDVSA could be shut out of its main export market, with wide-ranging implications for Venezuela's political and economic outlook. Although Venezuela will continue to enjoy strong diplomatic ties with Iran and Russia, neither country will be willing to provide game-changing amounts of finance in 2021-25.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends The Maduro regime's immediate policy priorities will be to contain the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak, alleviate ongoing diesel shortages and reverse a long-running economic collapse. However, progress (if any) on each of these goals will be limited.
To combat the coronavirus pandemic, the government is maintaining its "Fórmula 7+7 Plus" strategy, which involves alternating between a week of tighter restrictions and a week of more relaxed ones. However, this has so far failed to prevent fresh waves of the virus, increasing pressure on Venezuela's decrepit medical infrastructure. Meanwhile, the country's vaccine rollout has stalled owing to problems with procurement and distribution (as at mid-May only about 1% of the population had received at least one dose). We do not expect that enough doses of the vaccine will be distributed to have a significant impact on local transmission until 2023.
In an effort to address severe diesel shortages, the government has sought to increase domestic output by restarting operations at key refineries. However, the government's fix is not a viable long-term solution, mainly because producing diesel requires light crude, which is in limited supply. In order to ramp up domestic diesel output, PDVSA has had to cut back on blending operations of heavy crude from the Orinoco oil belt (which is limiting overall production and exports of crude oil). The government has also sought to intermittently import diesel through intermediaries, but it has limited foreign currency to increase its imports on the scale required. As a result, we believe that a long-term remedy will hinge on the Biden administration reinstating exemptions on crude-for-diesel swaps. We believe that this is likely to transpire later this year as the local humanitarian crisis deepens, but risks to this assumption are high.
Reversing Venezuela's economic decline will be a similarly difficult task. In the near term, the government's main challenge will be to retain its market share in China following the imposition of the bitumen tax (which amounts to about US$30/barrel). We expect that PDVSA will offer even steeper discounts on its crude, effectively wiping out a large share of its margin. That said, even with price concessions, some Chinese refineries will probably turn to importing benchmark grades instead of Venezuelan barrels that are subject to sanctions. In the longer term, the regime will need to work with its trading partners to find a way to bypass the tax, perhaps by rebranding Venezuelan crude as fuel oil from another country. However, any such strategy will require tacit acceptance by the Chinese authorities, given that independent refineries are subject to quotas on imports of most fuel products.
In the medium term, the regime will seek to pave the way for recovery by boosting private investment (given that the public sector is completely overstretched). The regime has promulgated an anti-blockade law, which gives the executive branch the unchecked authority to sign new deals with private firms and countries confidentially (in order to skirt international sanctions), without going through public tender processes. Concurrently, the regime is working on a hydrocarbons reform that would incentivise greater private-sector participation in the oil industry. However, these efforts are unlikely to yield significant results; even assuming that the regime manages to sidestep financial sanctions, it will struggle to attract new investment, given the abysmal business environment and a lack of confidence in the rule of law.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy The authorities have not published complete data on the fiscal accounts since 2011. However, we expect that a high level of inefficient current expenditure, combined with an extremely weak revenue intake, will keep the budget deficit wide and the public debt/GDP ratio above 300% throughout the 2021-25 forecast period. The sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will continue to prevent access to external finance, leaving the regime reliant on monetisation to fund its deficits. Even if the government reaches an agreement with some of its creditors (including China) to restructure debt liabilities during 2021-25, we still expect the public debt burden to remain huge, particularly as considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing-mainly PDVSA-issued debt and development funds-understate the true size of total public liabilities.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy Monetary policy will remain subservient to fiscal policy, as the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) continues to print money to finance the government's gaping budget deficits. In recent years the BCV has taken steps to control growth of monetary aggregates. For instance, in early 2019 it lifted the cash reserve ratio (CRR) to 100%, although it has relaxed the CRR slightly since that peak, to 85% currently. Far from taming inflation, these measures have led to the complete destruction of private-sector credit, which stands at less than 1% of levels recorded four years ago. These factors have accelerated the trend towards greater use of the US dollar in the economy; almost two-thirds of financial transactions now take place in dollars.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth In view of recent developments, we now expect real GDP to contract by 16% in 2021 (compared with our previous forecast for marginally positive growth). As a consequence, GDP will have contracted by almost four-fifths since its 2013 peak.
The short-term outlook for the oil sector has worsened markedly in view of the expected drop in demand from China, Venezuela's main export market. As export bottlenecks grow, PDVSA will have little choice but to cut production at its main facilities, given its beleaguered finances. We assume that the disruption will be temporary and that external demand will creep up over the medium term as PDVSA and its trading partners find ways to avoid US sanctions and Chinese taxes. However, the balance of risks is tilted heavily to the downside.
For its part, the non-oil economy will show little improvement early on in the forecast period, especially as an uncontrolled pandemic limits prospects for services activities. In the medium term, however, we expect some modest gains, assuming that continued dollarisation engenders relative macroeconomic stability. Nonetheless, we expect that Venezuela's GDP (in real terms) will be only about half of its 2018 level, even in 2025.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation A severely reduced domestic goods supply, constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits will impede the disinflationary process in 2021-25. The regime has shown little inclination to take on the fiscal and macroeconomic reforms that would address the root causes of inflation. It has, however, lent its support to an ongoing process of de facto dollarisation, which will help to ease price pressures over time.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates Hyperinflation will sustain bolívar depreciation in 2021. Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency redenomination (as in March 2018) is a strong possibility. Although a number of currency regulations officially remain on the books, the regime has largely stopped enforcing them in its recent embrace of dollarisation.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector Balance-of-payments pressures will remain severe in 2021-25, contributing to goods shortages and economic inequities. Foreign reserves stood at about US$6.3bn in April, down from about US$30bn a decade ago. This steep decline, which has been several years in the making, reflects poor policymaking and a lack of economic diversification in the country's external sector.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect reserves to fall to US$5.8bn this year, before recovering to US$7.6bn by 2025. These trends will be driven entirely by transactions on the current account, as Venezuela's access to foreign direct and portfolio investment will remain extremely limited. We expect the current-account deficit to remain wide, at 5.9% of GDP in 2021, before the balance shifts to a surplus of 0.4% of GDP in 2022. Thereafter, the account will remain in surplus, averaging 1.6% of GDP in 2023-25. Crucially, our forecasts assume that export earnings will recover from a nadir this year. We also expect that workers' remittances from abroad will play a crucial role in propping up the current-account balance.

Full text: - Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president, and his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) have dominated Turkey's political scene since coming to power in 2002. During this period they have tightened their grip on authority. Mr Erdogan's re-election in 2018 concluded Turkey's shift from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the AKP and Mr Erdogan to remain in power until at least 2023, when the next presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled. The AKP suffered a clear blow to its credibility when it lost the 2019 mayoral elections in both Ankara, the capital, and Istanbul, the largest city. However, the AKP and Mr Erdogan will maintain a tight grip on national institutions and the media in order to continue to dominate Turkish politics. Domestic and regional political issues will continue to shape Turkey's actions in the foreign policy sphere. Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are likely to remain antagonistic and transactional, rather than strategic.

- Our business environment score for Turkey stagnates in the forecast period (2021-25) and its global ranking falls by ten places, to 54th. Political tensions, increased powers concentrated under the president, an increasingly politicised central bank and higher inflation have raised the level of uncertainty about the direction of economic policy. The government will favour credit-fuelled economic growth, instead of implementing structural reforms and reorienting growth to a sustainable path. Large external imbalances leave Turkey's economy vulnerable to shifts in investor sentiment.

Real GDP growth (%) 1.6 3.9 3.8 3.4 3.3 3.4
Consumer price inflation (av, %) 12.3 14.5 10.1 6.7 8.7 9.5

- Real GDP growth slowed to 1.6% in 2020. We expect it to recover to 3.9% in 2021 and 3.8% in 2022, before averaging 3.4% per year in 2023-25-short of the government's annual 5% target but close to Turkey's medium-term potential. Poor government policies and the lack of credible institutions have created large external imbalances and triggered a Turkish lira sell-off in 2020. We believe that Turkey will avoid a balance-of-payments crisis in 2021, but risks have risen.

- The population is projected to rise from an estimated 84.3m in 2020 to 86.7m in 2025, with the female population continuing to outnumber the male population. The population is expected to grow by 0.6% per year during the forecast period, compared with growth of 1.4% during the historical period. The pace of population growth has slowed in recent decades, owing to the declining birth rate, which in turn reflects the combined impact on fertility rates of higher urbanisation rates, an improvement in the education level of women and wider use of birth control measures. Nevertheless, population growth is high by European standards and the average age is one of the lowest, at 32.8 years.

- The large consumer market is one of Turkey's main attractions to do business. The population is young, growing and inclined to consume rather than save, and average incomes will rise robustly in real terms from 2021 onwards. In 2020 GDP per head was US$8,491 at market exchange rates and US$30,515 at purchasing power parity (PPP). In 2025 we expect Turkey's GDP per head to increase to US$38,986 at PPP rates-still only at about 60% of the EU average.

- In the long term Turkey's economic growth performance is expected to be above that of emerging market peers such as Brazil, Russia and China. In 2021-50 we expect Turkey's economy to grow by an annual average of 2.9%, which will be well below that recorded in previous decades. Growth in GDP per head terms will be substantially lower, mainly reflecting lower labour productivity growth rates. Income levels will remain well below the EU27 average, but some convergence is likely. As a result, Turkey will remain an attractive market for international companies throughout 2021-50.

Background: The Turkish Republic was formed in 1923. Nationalist resistance forces led by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk defeated the occupying allies after the first world war, establishing the country's current borders. Since then, Turkey's political and economic structure has been oriented towards the West. The country became a member of the Council of Europe in 1949 and NATO in 1952, and signed an association agreement with the then European Community in 1963. A customs union with the EU took effect in 1996. EU accession negotiations were opened in October 2005, but progress has been slow, as Turkey's Western-EU anchor has weakened over the past decade. Under current political circumstances EU accession will not be possible in 2021-25.
Political structure: Turkey is a centralised secular democratic state, but checks and balances are limited and its secular character has been weakened by the religious conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002. Turkey has a history of military coups-in 1960, 1971 and 1980-leading to periods of military rule. There was a failed coup in July 2016. Turkey has had a presidential system of government, in place since the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, changed the parliamentary system in 2018, with parliament elected for a five-year term. To win seats, parties need at least 10% of the national vote. Since the failed coup, power has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of Mr Erdogan, the AKP leader, who was re-elected for a second presidential term in June 2018.
Policy issues: Maintaining macroeconomic stability and stabilising the lira in 2020 were the major policy challenges. The government rolled out a large fiscal stimulus to support the economy in 2020 and is using its state banks to expand credit growth. This has led to major external imbalances and a sharp lira sell-off. High political risks have led to inadequate capital inflows into Turkey and raised the risk of a balance-of-payments crisis, but a shift to positive real interest rates at the end of 2020 have helped to avoid this. The Kurdish issue, which has blocked economic development in the south-east, remains an important challenge. Politicisation of the judiciary since the coup attempt has undermined its independence. Corruption and patronage are widespread.
Taxation: The corporation tax rate was raised from 22% in 2018 to 25% in 2021. Personal income tax rates range between 15% and 35%. In January 2020 the highest marginal tax rate was raised from 35% to 40% for incomes of more than TL500,000 (US$60,000). Reducing tax evasion was one of the elements of previous IMF programmes, but compliance remains weak.
Foreign trade: In 2020 goods exports totalled US$168.4bn and imports about US$206.3bn, creating a trade deficit of about US$37.9bn and a particularly large current-account deficit of US$37.3bn (5.2% of GDP).

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance The president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his religiously conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) have dominated Turkish politics since 2002. In June 2018 they won the presidential and parliamentary elections respectively, with the support of their coalition partner, the right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP). Mr Erdogan and the AKP have tightened their grip on authority by replacing Turkey's parliamentary system of government with an executive presidential system in 2018, which concentrates control in the hands of Mr Erdogan, and by clamping down on all forms of political opposition. The relative economic stability that the AKP delivered during the initial phase of its dominance in the early 2000s has been instrumental in the party's electoral successes, as has been Mr Erdogan's personal appeal and his religious and conservative outlook, which is shared by much of the electorate. Mr Erdogan and his party have used their control of the state institutions and two years of emergency rule introduced after the failed coup in July 2016 to silence their critics, rather than focusing on economic reform and action to ease political and social polarisation. However, Mr Erdogan and the AKP suffered a clear blow to their credibility when an opposition candidate, Ekrem Imamoglu, increased his margin of victory over Binali Yildirim of the ruling coalition in the mayoral election rerun in Istanbul (Turkey's largest city) in June 2019. Since 2020 the popularity of the president and the AKP has taken another hit owing to the steep sell-off of the Turkish lira against all major currencies, high inflation and a weak labour market.
Mr Erdogan and the AKP have tightened their grip on authority The opposition National Alliance was formed ahead of the 2018 elections between the Republican People's Party (CHP; a social democratic party), the Felicity Party (SP; a smaller, conservative Islamic party), and the Good Party (IP; a small, right-wing nationalist party, formed by MHP defectors in late 2017). The pro-Kurdish, left-wing People's Democratic Party (HDP) also managed to win enough votes in the 2018 elections to enter parliament, despite Mr Erdogan's repeated attempts to delegitimise and weaken the movement. The government has accused the HDP of having links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a militant pro-Kurdish group. Despite declining popularity levels, Mr Erdogan will continue to dominate Turkish politics through a mixture of authoritarianism, control of state resources and the bureaucracy, a tight grip on media, and his still-strong personal popularity.

Political outlook: Political stability Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president, and his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) have dominated Turkey's political scene since 2002. During this period they have tightened their grip on authority, replacing Turkey's parliamentary system with an executive presidential system in 2018. The economy has become less stable as a result of political tensions, fraught international relations and unorthodox economic policies. This has jeopardised the hard-won improvements in macroeconomic stability on which the AKP built much of its previous electoral success.
The popularity of the president and the ruling AKP has taken a hit over the past year, following a steep sell-off of the lira against all major currencies (especially in 2018), high inflation and a weak labour market. To restore policy credibility, while also trying to reverse worsening popularity ratings, Mr Erdogan made changes in November to Turkey's top economic management team, including the appointment of a more orthodox, governor of the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT), which pulled the lira back from historic lows. However, in March 2021, Mr Erdogan replaced the CBT's governor again and the gains in the lira (against the US dollar) were immediately eroded.
Despite declining popularity levels, Mr Erdogan will continue to dominate Turkish politics through a mixture of authoritarianism, control of state resources and the bureaucracy, and his still-strong personal popularity, all aided by a largely supportive domestic media. The government will continue to clamp down on domestic political opposition in the years to come. Some political opponents of the government will also remain in prison on alleged terrorism charges, including a number of Kurdish opposition politicians.
Discussions have begun on a new constitution, to be enacted next year. Details are not yet available, but it could include processes to ensure that Mr Erdogan stays in power beyond 2028, when his second term as president would end (assuming, as seems likely, that he is re-elected in 2023). He plans to introduce economic and judicial reforms in 2021 and to improve human rights and strengthen property rights to appease Western governments and foreign investors.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness For most of the AKP's nearly two decades in power, political and government effectiveness improved. The economy was well managed and significant social reforms were implemented. However, in recent years intensifying domestic power struggles, a resurgence of terrorist violence since mid-2015 and a failed coup attempt in July 2016 have delayed reforms. In response to the failed coup the government introduced emergency rule, which remained in place until July 2018 and allowed the government to carry out an extensive purge of personnel in the military, the judiciary, the police force and academic institutions suspected of having links to the movement of an exiled Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen. The extent of the purge initially undermined institutional capacity, although most gaps appear to have now been plugged. The quality of the bureaucracy remains moderate, and we do not foresee substantial improve-ments in 2021-25.
The increased concentration of power under Mr Erdogan and his party's control of parliament mean that policy predictability and its overall long-term suitability, especially from the perspective of foreign investors, are suboptimal. Since 2013 economic policymaking institutions have become increasingly politicised-a feature that will persist in the medium term. The CBT will remain subject to pressure from Mr Erdogan's credit-driven-growth approach to economic policymaking. The economic downturn in 2020 led to the biggest credit growth boom in a decade, facilitated by Turkey's state banks and a politicised central bank. In November 2020 Mr Erdogan made a step towards policy normality and transparency by appointing a former finance minister, Naci Agbal (who is known for championing orthodox monetary policies), as central bank governor. However, he was replaced just four months later (in March 2021) by Sahap Kavcioglu, a critic of Mr Agbal's policies, adding to the unpredictability of Turkey's policies and damaging financial market sentiment.
Policymaking institutions have become increasingly politicised Concerns about the impartiality and efficiency of the legal system are unlikely to be resolved over the forecast period, given the continued politicisation of the judiciary. An AKP constitutional reform package, which was approved by referendum in 2010, changed the appointment procedure and composition of the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and the Constitutional Court. The changes facilitated the replacement of conservative secularist-nationalists in the judiciary with Gulenists, who, until 2013, were close allies of the AKP. Shortcomings in the judicial process were highlighted in coup plot investigations and trials that began in 2007. These were only addressed at appeal stage and after suspected Gulenists in the judiciary began investigating allegations of government corruption in late 2013. The purge of Gulenists from the judiciary accelerated after the failed coup in 2016. The upheaval is likely to increase uncertainty in the judicial process and prolong cases further.
Courts tend to interpret the law in favour of the state The courts' tendency to interpret the law in favour of the state and at the expense of the individual is unlikely to change, especially in cases involving minority rights and freedom of speech. In our business environment rankings we expect transparency and fairness of the judicial process to remain poor and its efficiency to deteriorate in 2021-25.
Corruption in the public sector is seen as a major deterrent by potential international investors. Legislation has been introduced to tackle it, but implementation will continue to be a problem and political patronage is likely to remain widespread. The public procurement law of 2003 was drafted to meet EU standards, but has since been watered down and amended so that important sectors, such as transport and energy, have been excluded. Turkey has improved compliance with the OECD's anti-bribery convention.
Political outlook: Election watch Mr Erdogan was re-elected president in June 2018, with 52.6% of the vote. At the parliamentary election, held at the same time, the Islamist-rooted AKP lost its absolute majority, although it secured a coalition majority with the small right-wing Nationalist Action Party (MHP). The election process appeared to be mostly free but largely unfair: opposition candidates received little or no domestic media coverage.
The alliance of the AKP and the MHP is currently tied in opinion polls with the alliance of the two largest opposition parties, the Republican People's Party (CHP) and the right-of-centre Good Party. A new party founded by a former prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, and another by a former deputy prime minister, Ali Babacan, may attract AKP supporters, as they target a similar conservative voter base, although not to levels that would threaten the AKP's hold on power. In the presidential election polls, Mr Erdogan is currently neck and neck with the CHP candidate, Ekrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul.
The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Mr Erdogan and the AKP to win the next presidential and parliamentary elections-due to be held in 2023-because of their popularity among Turkey's conservative voter base, the president's dominance of the media and the government's systematic clampdown on political opposition. A change in the electoral law (including increasing the threshold to enter parliament) is likely to be enacted in the coming months to bolster the AKP's prospects.
Political outlook: International relations The AKP and Mr Erdogan are seeking to bolster Turkey as a regional power in the Middle East, on a par with other majority Sunni countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt. This more assertive foreign policy-including regarding Azerbaijan, Syria and the eastern Mediterranean-has also helped the AKP to distract Turkish citizens from other domestic economic and political woes. This approach receives wide domestic backing.
Turkey's continuous deployment of an energy exploration research vessel in disputed waters in the gas-rich eastern Mediterranean has antagonised Greece. In December Turkey's prospecting activities in the Mediterranean led the EU to impose sanctions on Turkish energy officials and threaten wider action. However, these would only be light restrictions.
Turkish-US relations have been strained by Turkey's purchase of the Russian-made S-400 defence system (although it has not been activated yet) in 2019, despite the country's membership of NATO. In response to the defence system purchase, the US introduced sanctions in December 2020, but these are mild and target Turkey's defence procurement agency, in effect cutting Turkey off from US military hardware and technology. The US president, Joe Biden, is likely to take a tougher line on Turkey than the previous US administration of Donald Trump. There is a risk that the US may impose stronger sanctions (for instance, if Turkey activates the S-400 defence system). In a worst-case scenario, Turkey could join other US-sanctioned countries (Iran, North Korea and Russia) in being denied access to international financial institutions. However, we expect US policy to continue emphasising the need to keep Turkey in the Western camp.
Given the fragility of the economy and the vulnerability of the lira, Turkey can ill afford deeper rows with the US and the EU. Turkey has attempted to cool tensions by sending some conciliatory foreign policy signals to the US and the EU, even proposing to set up a joint working group with the US on the S-400 defence system. That said, we do not expect any improvement in Turkey's relations with the EU nor the US in 2021-25. On May 19th the European Parliament called for the country's accession talks to be suspended owing to lack of democracy and extensive violations of basic freedoms. Meanwhile, Turkey's efforts to foster closer relations with Russia will be complicated by Turkey's stance on Ukraine over the Donbas conflict. Russia's restrictions on commercial flights between the two countries until June 1st is probably due to Turkey's provision of military drones to the Ukrainian military.

The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment score for Turkey improves only marginally in the forecast period (2021-25) compared with the historical period (2016-20). With larger improvements forecast in other countries Turkey falls ten places in our global ranking, to 54th, and one place to the bottom (18th) of the regional ranking. Increased powers concentrated under the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and politicisation of monetary policy-the president has dismissed three central bank governors in two years-have created uncertainty about the direction of economic policy. In addition, domestic and international political tensions, large external imbalances and the policy challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic and the resurgence of infections in April 2021 leave the Turkish economy vulnerable to shifts in investor confidence, sharp fluctuations in Turkey's exchange rate and persistently high consumer price inflation. Despite past statements of commitment to a reform agenda aimed at rebalancing the economy, we expect the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government to continue to favour credit-driven economic growth.
The economy remains vulnerable to sharp shifts in investor confidence If foreign capital inflows were to dry up as a result of a loss of investor confidence, Turkey might need external financial support, but would have limited options. Any potential IMF programme is likely to be politically unacceptable. Major business environment shortcomings include the politicisation of regulatory bodies and the judicial system, cronyism and corruption, mismatches between skills and labour market needs, and widespread tax evasion. Major attractions for investors include Turkey's geographic location, its potential market size, its young and growing population, a customs union with the EU, free foreign-exchange and capital flows, and a large and dynamic private sector. However, the sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira in 2020-21 and the unpredictability of economic policymaking have increased the possibility of capital controls being introduced at some point in 2021-25.

Business environment outlook: Turkey's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Adverse market conditions delay any reform momentum and privatisation deals.
2023-25: Networks of patronage remain a constraint on the free market. Competition is still limited in several sectors.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) has been a government priority, but macroeconomic instability, increased nationalism, and concerns about security, corruption and politicisation of the judicial system will curb inflows.
2023-25: Further privatisation and government incentives to attract investment in major sectors could boost FDI inflows.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: The threat of sanctions from the US and the EU continues to hurt Turkey's trade and investment environment.
2023-25: Negotiations with the EU to update the customs union are likely to be protracted, given poor Turkish-EU relations.
Taxes 2021-22: To finance the widening fiscal deficit, the government raises income and value-added taxes. The corporation tax rate is raised to 25% in 2021 and 23% in 2022.
2023-25: Tax collection capacity will improve, but tax evasion remains an issue. No tax rises in the 2023 election year.
Financing 2021-22: The Central Bank of Turkey begins to cut its policy rate gradually in mid-2021, before raising rates again in 2022 to counter inflationary pressures. Government lending policy leads to a sharp increase in contingent liabilities.
2023-25: The government reverts to relying on state banks to extend credit and support economic growth. Continued reliance on capital inflows amid tighter global liquidity continues. Contingent liabilities remain problematic.
The labour market 2021-22: Government measures to support employment and ban lay-offs end. The inactivity rate continues to rise and the size of the shadow economy increases.
2023-25: Some improvements for employers, with legislation on severance pay and more flexible employment regulation.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Next stage of Istanbul Airport is operational. Slower progress on other projects, including Istanbul Canal.
2023-25: Landmark road and bridge projects near completion. New industrial zones become operational. Other major urban infrastructure projects around Istanbul could progress. Nevertheless, gaps and bottlenecks may persist.
Technological readiness 2021-22: Spending on research and development remains moderate, at about 1% of GDP, holding back efforts to move the economy up the value-added ladder.
2023-25: Turkey's young population spurs further rapid digital transformation of the banking sector.

Unpredictable policymaking has become a major source of instability Turkey's score and global ranking improve slightly during the forecast period, but from a low starting point during the historical period when the quality of economic policymaking and its institutional underpinnings deteriorated sharply. The score improvement in this category reflects our expectation of lower inflation, a gradual moderation of exchange-rate volatility and narrower current-account deficits during the forecast period compared with previous years. However, these parameters will remain vulnerable to both negative domestic and external economic developments. Policy shortcomings and failure to dampen inflation expectations could lead to a continued slide in the external value of the Turkish lira and another sell-off of Turkish financial assets. We expect the pace of Turkish real GDP growth to pick up moderately following the slowdown in 2019-20 trigged by the late 2018 currency crisis and the coronavirus pandemic, but more volatility cannot be ruled out given the government's preference for credit-fuelled expansion. Turkey's fiscal position has deteriorated in recent years. Although the budget deficit and government debt will remain relatively low in GDP terms and ease gradually during the forecast period, credit guarantees have increased contingent liabilities. Credit-driven economic growth and the accompanying high inflation will eventually feed through into higher levels of household and corporate indebtedness, although these remain will relatively low by European standards. The financial system will remain vulnerable to political interference, high levels of private-sector foreign-currency debt, bouts of lira weakness, volatile global liquidity conditions and a further rise in non-performing loans (NPLs).

Turkey has a large and dynamic private sector, and private property is generally well protected. However, the country's score and ranking remain low in this category in the forecast period owing to the significant role of the state in many sectors, widespread political patronage and corruption, and politicisation of regulatory bodies and the judicial system. The failed coup in 2016 led to the seizure or closure of firms, which in turn increased uncertainty, particularly because access to legal redress was limited. Although the state of emergency imposed in the aftermath of the attempted coup has been lifted, the erosion of the independence of state institutions will continue to cause uncertainty in the medium term and state intervention may increase over the coming years. The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2019 ranked Turkey 61st of 140 countries in terms of the burden of government regulation. The 2020 report focused on the priorities for recovery and revival after the coronavirus crisis. Turkey ranked last out of 37 countries in terms of economic transformation readiness. Starting a business in Turkey generally requires more time, procedures and funding than in an average high-income OECD country. Paying taxes also carries a greater burden, but registering property is simpler.
The government will continue to support private-sector investment
- We expect government support for private-sector investment and employment to continue. This will come through incentives such as tax breaks, social security and credit subsidies, and loan guarantees, with an emphasis on underdeveloped regions, technology, small and medium-sized enterprises, production of currently imported intermediary goods and "strategic" sectors (such as defence, aerospace, automotive and pharmaceuticals). Widespread use of government loan guarantees has allowed banks to lend to riskier customers, increasing the risks to banks from higher NPLs in the wake of the economic slowdown triggered by the coronavirus crisis.
- Free competition is likely to remain the norm in most sectors. The Competition Board has power over mergers and acquisitions, price-fixing and abuse of market position. Like most other regulatory agencies, however, the Competition Board will have limited effective independence, as it is appointed by the president. The state is also likely to remain dominant in many of the sectors in which it plays a leading role, such as gas and water, rail transport, tea and sugar production, infrastructure, and social services (including healthcare and education). The state also has a significant position in banking (about 35% of total assets), mining, the defence industry, postal services and legal gambling, and retains large stakes in Turk Telekom (30%) and Turkish Airlines (49%). There is a state-owned broadcaster (TRT) and a state-owned home-builder (TOKI). There are also sectors in which one or more private firms, including privatised companies, hold strong market positions.

The wealth fund will play a larger role in the economy
- Privatisation is well advanced in several sectors, including oil refining, parts of the energy sector, steel, mobile telecommunications, and tobacco and alcoholic drinks. However, we expect the slow pace of privatisation since 2014 to continue during the forecast period, owing to market volatility and the government's focus on retaining control and enhancing the value of strategic assets. Assets that have been slated for privatisation include operating rights for more ports, the national lottery and horse racing concessions, shares in toll roads and bridges, TOKI, VakifBank, more power plants, Istanbul's municipal companies, and some state-owned land. However, control of the three main state banks-Halkbank, Ziraat and VakifBank-looks set to remain in state hands. These banks may sometimes be used as a source of patronage.
- The establishment in 2016 of the Turkey Wealth Fund (TWF) has removed some government assets from the control of the privatisation agency. The fund was initially designed to help to finance large public works by using its assets as collateral, making sales of the assets under its control less likely. It now includes assets such as the state's stake in Turkish Airlines, Turk Telekom, Ziraat Bank, Halkbank, VakifBank, Borsa Istanbul and Botas-an oil and gas pipeline operator-and the recently formed Turkey Insurance and Turkey Life Pension as a result of the merger of six insurance and pension fund firms in September 2020.
- TWF's role in the economy is likely to expand further, if, as we expect, the fund is used to inject cash and take controlling stakes in companies facing difficulties arising from the coronavirus pandemic. Besides Turkey Insurance and Turkey Life Pension, TWF acquired a controlling 26% stake in the previously privately owned mobile phone operator, Turkcell, in June 2020, and may raise its 6.7% stake in Turk Telekom, which was sold to Dubai-based Oger Telecom in 2005. The three private banks that took over a 51% stake from Oger in 2018 are seeking to sell their participation.
- Price controls operate for various reasons in electricity, gas, petroleum, telecoms and pharmaceuticals. However, despite public ownership of major energy sector assets, privatisation, new investments, the Electricity Market Law of March 2013 and changes in regulations have increased liberalisation, helping to widen consumer choice over power providers. Competition will continue to be constrained in other sectors by the large shadow economy; the smuggling of petroleum products, cigarettes and many other items; and the violation of intellectual property rights in many sectors, from software to fashion.
- Political patronage and exclusive business networks will continue to play a significant role in business life. Companies close to government circles may be boldest in entering public tenders or operating in sectors where major decisions are taken by politicians, regulators or bureaucrats. Industrial policy may facilitate favouritism or uncompetitive arrangements. Some companies may face higher bureaucratic obstacles or tougher tax inspections than others.
- Build-operate-transfer or public-private partnership schemes will increase the role of the private sector in the management of airports, water and irrigation facilities, and hospitals. The railways are being restructured, and the rail network has been separated from train services. The state will continue to play a dominant role in the sector for some time to come, as so far only a few freight rail transport licences have been granted to private operators.
- There is scope for further improvement in the protection of intellectual property. Legislation has been gradually brought in line with EU practices. In particular, a single, unified industrial property law came into force in January 2017 that replaced a patchwork of decrees regulating trademarks, patents, designs and geographical indications. Both Turkish and foreign companies are increas-ingly sensitive to this issue, so there is also likely to be progress in enforcement.

Heavy reliance on foreign-capital inflows increases incentive to attract FDI Turkey's low savings rate and heavy dependency on foreign-capital inflows makes attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) a priority, and in principle the government and most sections of Turkish society have generally accepted and respected foreign ownership in industry and services. However, Turkey's score in this category is unchanged in the forecast period, as we expect little progress on reforms aimed at reducing macroeconomic instability risk and removing the main deterrents to foreign investment. Foreign ownership is restricted in a few areas, including broadcasting and civil aviation, and the government has become more suspicious of foreign capital. The courts and sections of the public are also occasionally hostile towards foreign investors when environmental issues or natural resources are at stake. Turkey's politicised judicial system, corruption and political patronage also act as deterrents for potential foreign investors.

- Privatisation in energy and other sectors may provide opportunities for foreign investors, often in conjunction with local partners. The government will especially promote FDI in greenfield and expansion projects that can further its industrial policy goals, including import substitution and technological inno-vation. Low asset valuations as a result of the weakness of the lira may also attract investors, particularly to export-oriented firms that have receipts in US dollars.
- In principle, foreign investors will continue to have the same access to government incentives as domestic investors do. Plans to cut red tape and streamline the legal system would benefit both foreign and domestic businesses. There have been no restrictions on repatriation of profits, even at times of financial market stress. We do not expect even temporary restrictions to be imposed (Turkey has never done so in the past), as it would deter future investments into Turkey, but the risk of capital controls being introduced at some point during the forecast period has increased.

Capital-account controls cannot be ruled out given renewed lira weakness Turkey's score and rankings deteriorate in this category in the forecast period, reflecting our assessment of the possibility of capital-account controls being introduced at some point given the renewed sharp depreciation of the lira in 2020-21 and the unpredictability of economic policymaking. The currency has been fully convertible since 1989, and the authorities have not considered the use of capital controls, even during periods of severe exchange-rate and financial market volatility, being keenly aware of the reputational damage that this could cause, including potentially impeding Turkey's access to international financial markets for several years. As a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) with a customs union with the EU, Turkey is committed to a broadly open trading regime. However, global trade tensions and political rifts between Turkey and some of its trading partners, notably the US, have periodically caused disruption to bilateral trade and exacerbated exchange-rate volatility. Under the 1996 customs union with the EU, Turkey has customs-free trade in manufactured goods with EU member states and has adopted the EU common customs tariff. However, the country has refused to grant Greek Cypriot ships and planes access to its ports and airports unless the EU facilitates direct trade between the EU and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), which is only currently recognised by Turkey. Turkey's import regime reflects the EU's free-trade agreements (FTAs). It has bilateral FTAs with the European Free-Trade Association (EFTA).

- The coronavirus crisis depressed global trade flows in 2020, which has hurt Turkey's export sectors. However, lira weakness has made exports more competitive, positioning them well to benefit from the global recovery from 2021. Beyond the crisis, we also believe that Turkey may benefit from "near-shoring" trends: European companies may increase investment in manufacturing plants in Turkey in order to reduce the fragility of global supply chains.
- We believe that the government is unlikely to resort to outright protectionism, despite its efforts to encourage domestic production of items currently imported in large quantities. However, short-term protective measures will continue to be employed to limit imports of textiles, petrochemicals and other items from lower-cost countries. Some restrictions on agricultural imports exist, but, concerned by high food price inflation in recent years, the authorities have tinkered with tariffs and quotas in order to lower prices.
- Turkey and the EU have agreed to revisit the current customs union agree-ment with a view to expanding it to potentially cover agricultural goods, services and public procurement, but talks have not yet started seven years since the agreement. Some EU politicians have suggested that talks should be linked to political criteria. If this were to be the case, the chances of reaching an agreement during the forecast period would be low. Turkey is negotiating or pursuing FTAs with several other economies, especially countries such as Canada, Mexico and Japan, which have signed FTAs with the EU. Prompted by the UK's departure from the EU, Turkey and the UK signed an FTA, which took effect in 2021.
- In the absence of a Cyprus settlement, Turkey is likely to resist EU pressure to open ports and airports to Greek Cypriot ships and planes. Similarly, without progress in its EU accession negotiations, Turkey is unlikely to lift restrictions on EU meat and used-car imports, eliminate discriminatory taxes on alcoholic drinks and tobacco products, or open up trade in services.

Corporation tax rate set to rise to 25% in 2021 and 23% in 2022 Turkey's global rank in this category has fallen six places to 48th in 2021-25, despite a slight improvement in the score. As a percentage of GDP, tax revenue is low by OECD standards, owing to high levels of evasion and limited administrative capacity. According to OECD figures, tax revenue (including social security contributions) comprises about 23% of GDP, compared with an OECD average of about 34% (2019 data). In response to the 2018 currency crisis, the corporation tax rate was raised from 20% to 22% for a period of three years to 2020. It was due to fall to 20% again in 2021, but in April 2021 the government decided to increase it instead to 25% in the 2021 tax year (corporation tax declarations are due in July 2021) and 23% in 2022. Personal income tax rates range from 15% to 35%. Turkey's tax structure has changed only moderately over the last decade. According to central government budget figures, corporation tax now accounts for around 12.5% of total tax receipts, up from just below 10% up to 2017. However, a high proportion-around two thirds-still comes from indirect taxes, including value-added tax (VAT). VAT is levied at a standard rate of 18% (with lower rates of 8% and 1% for some items), and special consumption taxes apply on some goods and services such as petroleum, alcohol, tobacco products, motor vehicles and telecoms services. Obligatory social security contributions consist of 20.5% of gross salary (up to a certain limit) from the employer, 14% from the employee and a combined total of 3% to the Unemployment Insurance Fund from both parties. Tax breaks, social security premium reductions and incentives are available to encourage investment in underdeveloped regions, strategic sectors and technological innovation.

- In response to the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus outbreak, the government announced a range of temporary tax measures in 2020 in order to support businesses, including the deferral of payments of social security premiums and cuts to VAT rates in hard-hit sectors such as retail, automotive and logistics. However, the corporation tax rate was left unchanged, and will be increased in 2021-22. Given Turkey's widening budget deficit, the government is unlikely to lower the corporation tax rate substantially in 2023-25.

Frequent changes in tax regulation and evasion are likely to continue
- Frequent changes in tax regulation are likely to continue, as will wide-spread tax and social security evasion, which is encouraged by frequent amnesties and opportunities to restructure arrears. One such amnesty was introduced in mid-2018, mainly to garner political support ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections that year. Another in 2019 focused on encouraging the repatriation of undeclared foreign assets. Plans to simplify the tax system have been on the agenda for some time, but have been consistently postponed.
- Foreign firms will continue to be treated in the same way as Turkish companies. During the forecast period Turkey is expected to expand the already large number of double-taxation agreements that it has with other countries.

Turkey's financing score and rankings deteriorate sharply during the forecast period. The country slips to 45th (compared with 24th in our historic period) in the global ranking and ranks second last in the regional category, down from 11th in 2016-20. This reflects the banking sector's increased vulnerability in recent years to political interference, financial market volatility, currency weakness and high levels of private-sector foreign-currency debt. Reforms introduced under the guidance of the IMF and the World Bank in the wake of the financial crisis in Turkey in 2000-01 transformed the banking sector to become well regulated, well capitalised and highly profitable. Three state-controlled banks and four large private banks dominate the sector, accounting for about 75% of total assets. The state banks have largely operated on a commercial basis, and direct government intervention in the private sector has been rare. There have been periodic surges in bank lending growth since 2010, driven by lower government borrowing needs, strong domestic and global liquidity, steadily expanding government credit guarantees, and pressure on banks to lend more and at lower interest rates.
Major banks are well capitalised, but higher NPLs pose risks
- Volatile global liquidity and high levels of corporate debt will restrict credit to the private sector, especially households and small businesses. The strongest Turkish companies, like banks, are likely to continue to have access to loans from foreign banks and to local and international bond markets, but the cost of financing is likely to be high by international standards.
- With economic activity slowing sharply in 2019-20 and debt servicing more onerous owing to the weakness of the lira, NPLs have risen sharply, more than doubling in 2018-19, pushing the NPL ratio to a peak of 5.4% of total credit at end-2019, up from 2.8% in mid-2018. NPL levels stabilised in 2020 and the ratio gradually declined to 3.8% in March 2021, reflecting strong lending growth-total credit to the private sector expanded by an average of about 36% in 2020-and government policy requiring banks to treat debtors more leniently. This has caused Turkish banks to become increasingly vulnerable to the risks from higher NPLs.
- Low domestic savings will also remain a constraint. The government has pledged further changes to the private pension system, which if implemented would help to increase the availability of finance with longer maturities, albeit only over the medium term.
- Difficult financial conditions are likely to slow further the pace of share offerings on the volatile Borsa Istanbul, the country's main stock exchange. Market capitalisation in US dollar terms is low, at 36% of GDP at end-2020, up from 24.6% of GDP at end-2019, mainly reflecting a sharp contraction in dollar nominal GDP. About two-thirds of the free float is foreign-owned during periods of financial stability, but this figure had declined to below 50% in the first quarter of 2021, as a result of a sell-off of Turkish assets since 2018.
- Changes in bank ownership may occur, particularly among smaller banks, without changing the sector's overall structure. The AKP's antipathy towards private bank owners and sympathy for consumers and credit customers will encourage tighter regulation of certain activities, such as credit-card issuance.

Turkey's labour market score remains unchanged in the forecast period, but its global ranking in this category falls sharply. The country has a large, young labour pool, but workforce participation is only about 52%, partly owing to traditions that discourage female employment. Despite a greater number of years of formal education, the average level of education and skill remains below average European standards, and mismatches between education and the needs of the labour market persist. Employment of foreigners is rare, and obtaining work permits can be problematic, but some restrictions have been eased. Informal employment and subcontracting are commonly used to avoid tax, legal obligations and rigidities, but they create unfair competition, undermine safety standards and hinder productivity gains. In formal employment, hours and conditions are generally regulated and inflexible.
Impact on employment will emerge when pandemic support is lifted
- Turkey's official unemployment rate has remained broadly unchanged during the coronavirus crisis at 12.9% in the first quarter of 2021 compared with annual averages of 13.1% in 2020 and 13.7% in 2019, owing mainly to temporary government measures largely aimed at limiting redundancies among workers in formal paid employment, including an near-total ban on lay-offs. However, the full extent of the impact on the labour market of the pandemic is likely to be clearer when support is withdrawn from June 2021. Unemployment is likely to be much higher than official figures show as some of those who lost their jobs are likely to have dropped out of the workforce altogether, while young people may have postponed their entry into the workforce, discouraged by the lack of job opportunities. The government aims to make the labour market more flexible while improving access to unemployment benefits. We expect the use of flexible contracts in the formal sector to increase only slowly. Current labour market activation and education policies are likely to raise skills levels and workforce participation only gradually.
- In response to employers' complaints about high labour costs, the government has sought to lighten the burden of social security contributions, especially for underdeveloped regions and the employment of young people, women and people with disabilities. Following rises in lira terms of 14.2% in 2018, 26% in 2019 and 15% in 2020, the monthly gross minimum wage was raised by almost 22% at the beginning of 2021 to a relatively high TL3,578 (US$430).
- Firms complain that the system of severance pay, under which employers are liable to pay substantial lump sums to employees who retire, resign or are made redundant, is too generous, hindering formal hiring. A reform has been on the government agenda for many years. As of mid-May 2021, no major changes had yet been enacted. The government's plan is for firms to establish a severance pay fund for employees, which will sit alongside their personal pension fund into which employers also pay contributions. The proposal was met with resistance from unions, so may take several more years to implement.
- Restrictions on union membership, strikes and lock-outs that are incompatible with international norms promoted by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the EU are unlikely to be lifted.

Major infrastructure projects are under way, but shortcomings persist In recent years investment by national and local governments, as well as the private sector, have led to some visible improvements in Turkey's infrastructure, ranging from rapid growth of domestic air travel to the gradual extension of the natural gas pipeline network to almost all provinces, and the spread of broadband internet access and mobile-phone services. The government's preference has been for large infrastructure projects, with several grandiose projects in the pipeline. The construction of a 3.9-km-long suspension bridge over the Dardanelles is on track to open in early 2022. However, tenders have yet to be issued for the controversial Canal Istanbul, a canal linking the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara, and an ambitious three-tier undersea tunnel across the Bosphorus and raising finance for these larger projects could be challenging.

- Fixed-line broadband internet access has grown rapidly, but at an estimated 19% in 2020 the penetration rate is well below an average of 30-40% for most other European countries. When including large and rapidly rising numbers of mobile broadband subscriptions, the penetration rate is much higher. However, the coronavirus pandemic has delayed the introduction of fifth-generation (5G) networks, compared with the government's original target of June 2020.

Infrastructure shortcomings-including urban overcrowding, congestion, earthquake risk, and strains on water supply, waste disposal systems and the energy network-will persist. Improvements in road and rail transport infrastructure will be piecemeal, and as a whole will continue to lag EU standards, especially given the long distances between cities. Public and private investment will ensure that seaport capacity expands, despite bottlenecks and incomplete privatisation of management rights at some state-owned ports.

- Energy sector privatisation and market liberalisation will continue gradually. Private investment (coupled with limited public investment) may be enough to increase power-generation capacity, cut transmission and distribution losses, and prevent blackouts.
- In addition to domestic onshore activity, Turkish Petroleum, a state-run firm, has been exploring and drilling in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. However, drilling operations in the latter have fuelled tensions with Cyprus, Greece and the EU. Plans to construct two nuclear plants are also highly controversial. The first reactor of the four planned at the Akkuyu site in Mersin province should come on stream in 2023.

E-commerce is growing rapidly, but growth is from a low base Turkey ranks 42nd in the global rankings for technological readiness in the forecast period, well behind Russia (20th), but ahead of Bulgaria (58th) and Romania (56th)-some of its main competitors for FDI. E-commerce is growing rapidly, reflecting rising internet and credit-card use, as well as high mobile-phone penetration and steady improvements in the online environment in areas such as security and after-sales service. Online sales rose by an annual average of about 40% in 2018-20. However, growth has been from a low base of about 5% of total retail sales, compared with about 10% in developed economies.

- Intense competition in the mobile-telecoms sector should ensure that infrastructure remains adequate and up to date, although there may be delays in adopting the latest technology, or it may initially be expensive or concentrated in major cities. Computer ownership has risen rapidly. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat), an estimated 90.7% of households had access to the internet in 2020, up from about 30% in 2009.
- Research and development (R&D) spending in Turkey amounted to 1.1% of GDP in 2019, broadly unchanged on the two previous years. However, given that nominal GDP growth averaged 17% in that period, R&D spending rose strongly in nominal terms, which we expect to continue during the forecast period. R&D spending is greater than in Romania or Bulgaria (0.5% of GDP and 0.8% respectively in 2018) and is broadly in line with that in Greece, Poland and Russia (1-1.2% of GDP). As in most emerging economies, large, export-oriented private-sector firms account for the bulk of R&D spending in Turkey.

Economic forecast: Policy trends The economic downturn in 2020 led to the biggest credit growth boom in a decade, facilitated by Turkey's state banks and a politicised central bank. This has kept inflation high, owing to lira depreciation against all other major currencies. In November 2020 the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, made a step towards policy normality and transparency by appointing a former finance minister, Naci Agbal (who is known for championing orthodox monetary policies), as central bank governor. However, he was replaced in March 2021, adding to the unpredictability of Turkey's policies and damaging financial market sentiment. The new governor, Sahap Kavcioglu, a former member of parliament and official of Halkbank, a Turkish state bank, is a critic of Mr Abgal's policies. Mr Kavcioglu has stated his commitment to reducing inflation, but his appointment has triggered expectations of early rate cuts. Although the new central bank governor looks set to loosen policy, we do not expect cuts as large as the market fears.
A fresh lockdown came into force in April onwards in response to the recent increase in coronavirus cases. Mr Erdogan has announced that the redundancy ban introduced last year, and the related employment subsidy, will be extended until end-June. He also promised a one-month extension of monthly payments to small traders affected by the virus, the postponement of some debt repayments and an increase in the amount of cash support to poor households.
Turkey's economy has displayed resilience during previous bouts of political instability and market volatility, owing to a prudent approach to the public finances, effective capitalisation of the banking sector, and a dynamic and diversified private sector. However, other shortcomings, such as cronyism and corruption, skills mismatches and tax evasion, are unlikely to be effectively addressed in the forecast period. Reforms to address the structural imbalances that underlie Turkey's recurring boom-and-bust economic cycle are needed. There is a risk of the government reverting to its preferred policy of unsustainable rapid credit growth, which could cause a sudden credit stop and a potential balance-of-payments crisis. There is also a risk of US financial sanctions, which would further impede Turkey's ability to attract foreign-currency inflows and restrict its access to global debt markets.

Under the Justice and Development Party (AKP), the public finances used to be one of the economy's most reassuring aspects. However, since 2018 the budget deficit has widened significantly, driven by higher government spending on defence, security, infrastructure, public employment and social benefits, eroding this credibility. The budget deficit reached 3.4% of GDP in 2020, as coronavirus-related restrictions negatively affected revenue growth and the government deferred collection of some tax and social security premium payments. In 2021 the deficit will ease to 2.8% of GDP. We expect the finance minister, Lutfi Elvan, to reintroduce a more prudent approach to the public finances in an effort to recover policy credibility and reassure investors. Further rises in indirect taxes, a restructuring scheme for tax payments and a proposed rise in corporate income tax to 25% should also benefit the budget this year.
Ahead of the election in 2023, we expect the deficit to stay elevated, averaging 3.3% of GDP per year in 2022-23. It will then narrow to an average of 2.5% of GDP in 2024-25 as the government reins in spending to reassure investors. Government debt reached 39.7% of GDP in 2020, and will peak at 39.9% in 2021, before gradually falling to 35% in 2025.

The central bank adopted an ultra-loose policy in the early stages of the coronavirus crisis and cut the main policy rate by 300 basis points to 8.25% in the first half of 2020, pushing real rates firmly into negative territory. This helped economic activity to recover via a credit boom, but also contributed to a lira sell-off, a rapid loss of foreign-exchange reserves and high inflation. From August the bank reversed course and began to tighten policy, although the initial tightening was conducted via the back door. It raised rates by a total of 1,075 basis points to 19% between September 2020 and March 2021, and minimised exchange-rate interventions. In addition, the banking regulator abolished the "asset ratio" for banks, which had forced lenders to extend credit and buy sovereign bonds, and which had been partly responsible for Turkey's credit boom.
The appointment on March 20th of a new central bank governor has caused a loss of investor confidence and has triggered expectations of early rate cuts. We expect the first rate cut to come in June, but this will be small and further easing will be gradual. We expect a policy rate of 15% at end-2021, with real rates remaining in positive territory, which should help to keep investors on board. We expect a continued decline of foreign-exchange reserves as the bank tries to defend the currency, as well as a renewed increase in the dollarisation rate of lira deposits. In 2022 we expect rates to be raised again in an attempt to fight inflationary pressures.

Turkey's economy grew by 1.6% in 2020, making the country one of only two of the G20 major economies that recorded growth amid the coronavirus pandemic (the other one being China). In 2021 we expect further modest economic growth, of 3.9%. Economic activity appears to have held up well in the first quarter of 2021. In the second quarter indicators of economic activity benefited from a strong base effect. However, there are downside risks to our forecast stemming from a volatile lira, high interest rates, high inflation (with negative consequences for input costs for businesses), rising risk premiums and the continuing effects of the pandemic. Turkey's vaccination campaign has slowed, and insufficient supply of vaccines may persist for another few months. As at May 26th 14.4% of the population was fully vaccinated, which is comparable with France (15%) or Italy (18%), but well below the UK (34.8%) and the US (39.4%). Further uncertainties stem from Turkey's macroeconomic imbalances, the country's economic policy, geopolitics and the coronavirus situation globally.
To strengthen investor confidence beyond 2021, additional reforms-such as guaranteeing the independence of the central bank and reducing government involvement in the banking sector-would be required. Nonetheless, despite its structural shortcomings, Turkey's catch-up potential is considerable, and the economy is competitive, which underpins our view that growth will be 3.8% in 2022. In 2023, when the next general election is scheduled, we expect a stronger credit impulse to reappear and forecast real GDP growth of 3.4%. In 2024-25 we forecast average annual growth of 3.4%, which we believe is close to Turkey's medium-term potential.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends As in most developing countries, the share of agriculture in nominal GDP has declined steadily in Turkey in recent decades, but, at an estimated 7.2% of gross value added in 2020, it remains an important sector, especially considering the input that it provides to Turkey's food, beverages and tobacco manufacturing industry. In addition, agriculture still accounts for a substantial share-17.6% in 2020-of total employment, although almost half of those employed in the sector are classified as unpaid family workers. We expect the share of output of the primary sector to remain broadly stable during the forecast period, but it will remain large compared with most other European countries, at just under 7% of GDP in 2025. In 2016 the sector was hit by Russian sanctions on agricultural imports from Turkey, but most were lifted by mid-2017 following the rapprochement between the two countries in June 2016. The sector would benefit from investment in irrigation in the south east of the country and in some other regions, but investment is likely to remain on hold in areas affected by the conflict with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). More generally, the importance of modern, large-scale agricultural enterprises will spread gradually, but the problems of traditional agriculture and unclear policymaking are likely to persist.
Manufacturing will continue to play a central role in the Turkish economy Industry, including manufacturing, mining and construction, accounted for about 30.3% of GDP in 2020. The collapse in investment and export demand during the 2008-09 global crisis hit the manufacturing and construction sectors hardest. Since then manufacturing, and particularly construction, has re-bounded. In 2020 manufacturing accounted for nearly 25% of GDP, relatively unchanged since the end of the 1990s. In 2020 industrial production growth was a sluggish 1.6%, as a result of the coronavirus induced global recession and plunging external demand, but in 2021-25 we expect the sector to rebound strongly.
Construction was a significant driver of economic growth in 2010-17. In 2017 real value added in the sector, which is dominated by housing construction and mega infrastructure projects, expanded by 9%, following growth of about 5% in the previous three years. The pace of housing construction outstripped demand for several years, even after allowing for strong demographically driven growth in the number of households and the continued replacement of existing buildings. In 2017 growth was bolstered by a strong expansion in credit as a result of pressure by the president on banks to lower mortgage rates; the indirect effect of the credit guarantee fund; the relaxation of macroprudential measures and ample global international liquidity. This has resulted in a reported 1.5m-2m new homes being unoccupied, a situation that has weakened developers' finances and reduced the incentive for new investments. Infra-structure and building investments via public-private partnerships, which had picked up significantly over the past five years, have also contributed to robust construction growth. In 2018-20 construction output plunged, given the oversupply of housing, the high ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) in the sector, the depreciation of the lira against the US dollar, high interest rates and a slowdown in economic growth.
Several manufacturing subsectors will rebound from 2021 Several manufacturing subsectors, such as automotive, and textiles and clothing, are strongly export-oriented and suffered from low export growth in 2020, but continued to be an important source of foreign export earnings, and will rebound from 2021 onwards. Turkey's manufactured exports are generally import intensive. A large portion of the inputs-including energy, intermediates and capital goods-are imported, adding to Turkey's external imbalances, especially when international commodity prices are high or the lira is weak, as it has been since mid-2013. This structural situation is unlikely to change much during the forecast period, as reducing the import intensity of exports and moving up the value-added chain will take time, even though these were explicit goals in the government's investment-incentive system, which was introduced in 2012.
Vehicle production in 2019 was 15% below record production levels in 2017 The automotive sector tends to be Turkey's biggest export. In 2020 the total production of Turkey's automotive industry amounted to 1,297,854 vehicles, according to the Automotive Manufacturers Association (OSD)-11% lower than the previous year. Exports fell by 27% to 916,543 in parallel with the coronavirus-related slump in the European car market. Turkey runs a considerable trade surplus in its automotive sector, and this surplus has expanded owing to strong export demand alongside import restrictions and the weak currency. That said, according to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat), earnings from exports of automotive vehicles and parts declined by 18% to US$22.1bn in 2020, whereas the value of imports rose 53% to US$15.3bn.
Most vehicle manufacturers will maintain facilities in Turkey While uncertainties related to the coronavirus pandemic persist, vehicle production can be expected to grow by up to 10% in 2021. The trade surplus in the automotive sector may also improve. Almost 80% of motor vehicles produced in Turkey are exported, and the bulk of these go to the EU (Turkey accounts for almost 30% of vehicles imported by the EU). As a result, vehicle production will fluctuate in line with demand in Europe, which we expect to recover from 2021. The significant depreciation of the lira against the dollar and euro will be likely to support firm export volumes over the medium term. Given its location and its trade agreement with the EU, Turkey will remain an important automotive hub, but political uncertainties will weigh on investor confidence. Over the medium term, considering the growth potential of the automotive market in Turkey and the wider region, manufacturers with production plants in Turkey may start to focus more on the Turkish, Middle Eastern and North African markets. The domestic market will be supported by rising incomes and replacement demand. In the domestic market, a total of 796,200 vehicles were sold in 2020, including 610,109 passenger cars. These figures represented increases of 61.9% and 57.6% respectively over the low levels of 2019.
We believe that most manufacturers will maintain their production facilities in Turkey. These facilities are technologically advanced, and labour costs are much lower in Turkey than in core European countries, and most central and east European countries, where wages have risen strongly following accession to the EU. However, if Turkey is to remain a major automotive production location in the medium to long term, manufacturers will have to move away from exporting low-end passenger cars, light commercial vehicles and components to north European markets, and towards developing and producing alternative-energy engines and vehicles. There are signs that this transition is already happening. The market will be supported by cuts to taxes on hybrid and electric vehicles.
The textiles and clothing industries remain important The textiles and clothing industries remain important to the Turkish economy. The industries have undergone restructuring under the intense pressure of competition from low-cost producers in Asia, including China, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The government has also been looking at ways to improve investment incentives and target higher value-added products. Both these industries suffered from subdued demand in 2020 amid the global recession. However, over the medium term a more competitive currency and ample growth potential will underpin robust growth prospects. Competitive pressures from lower-cost centres of production will remain a risk.
Reduced security concerns will drive tourism growth Tourism, one of the most important services sectors of the Turkish economy-an important source of economic activity, employment and foreign exchange-witnessed rapid growth in the past decade, but is highly vulnerable to geopolitical developments and changes in the exchange rate. Istanbul, the largest city, remains the top destination and accounts for a third of all arrivals. It seems that security concerns are no longer deterring visitors from important markets. Tourism came to a complete halt in the second quarter of 2020, and suffered severe losses in the remainder of the year by comparison with the record performance of 2019, reflecting the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on international tourism. Based on TurkStat data, annual visitor numbers (including non-resident Turks) plunged by 69.5% to 15.8m and revenue dropped by 65.1% to US$12.1bn. This decline continued in the first quarter of 2021. Turkey has introduced a compulsory "safe tourism" certification programme for tourism enterprises, prioritised tourism workers for vaccinations and exempted foreign tourists from curfews. However, countries such as the UK and Germany currently ban foreign holidays altogether or warn strongly against travel to Turkey. Quarantine and testing requirements also remain in place for people returning from abroad. For EU citizens, travel to alternative destinations within the EU, such as Greece and parts of Spain, is likely to be easier than travel to Turkey this summer. Russia, Turkey's largest single market, has halted almost all flights to and from Turkey until the end of June-a step expected to result in the loss of an estimated 800,000 visitors. From 2021 we expect the sector to recover. We expect tourism revenue to make a larger contribution to the current-account balance than in 2020, but to remain 40-50% lower than in 2019.

Inflation averaged 12.3% in 2020 as a result of excessive lira depreciation against the dollar and the euro. Although bases of comparison will be favourable and monetary policy has tightened since late 2020, rising global prices, persistent inflationary expectations, potential monetary loosening and further expected lira depreciation will keep inflation high in 2021, at an average of 14.5%-well above the central bank's 5% target. In 2022 we expect inflationary pressures to remain elevated, at 10.1%, mainly because of continued lira volatility. We expect inflation to dip in 2023 as price controls are imposed ahead of the election, before picking up again in 2024-25.

Overall, the lira depreciated by about 19% against the dollar on average in 2020, despite central bank interventions. The lira was bolstered by the appointment of a new central bank governor, who promptly embarked on an explicit tightening of monetary policy. However, since Mr Agbal's sudden dismissal by the president in March, the lira has weakened again, and is currently trading at around TL8.5:US$1. His successor as governor, Mr Kavcioglu, has increasingly sought to reassure markets that interest rates will not be cut prematurely. However, investors remain wary, owing to Mr Erdogan's known preference for low rates.
Foreign-exchange reserves fell from US$77.4bn at end-February 2020 to about US$49bn at end-May 2021, with net central bank reserves increasingly negative. The bank's new governor is likely to start loosening monetary policy in June 2021. Internal and external imbalances, renewed policy unpredictability, poor international relations, foreign investors' concerns regarding the central bank's independence, and a reliance on short-term capital inflows will all contribute to a depreciation of the lira against the dollar. As a result, we expect the lira to end the year at TL8.79:US$1.
In 2022-25 we forecast that the lira will continue to follow a depreciatory path (weakening by 1.6% in nominal terms on average) amid elevated current-account deficits and high inflation in Turkey, together with a gradual normalisation of monetary policy in the US and the euro area.

The current-account deficit amounted to 5.2% of GDP in 2020. Still-subdued domestic demand and pressure on the lira will temper imports in 2021, while tourism earnings will partly recover. The current-account deficit will narrow sharply, to 2.2% of GDP, this year as the economy begins to rebalance. Attracting sufficient capital inflows to cover the deficit and service foreign debt, without further drawdowns of already inadequate foreign-exchange reserves, will be complicated by the renewed uncertainties relating to monetary and foreign policy. We expect conditions for borrowing from abroad to deteriorate, given the widespread lack of investor confidence.
The outlook for capital inflows remains uncertain, given global financial conditions and investor concerns about Turkey's economic management, which increases the risk of a balance-of-payments crisis. However, Turkey has faced several balance-of-payments crises in the past without resorting to capital controls, which Mr Erdogan strongly opposes. Furthermore, a balance-of-payment crisis is not our core forecast, as many banks will opt for short-term syndicated loans, which will allow them to roll over external debt.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Turkey Stocks and flows Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows rose dramatically in 2005-08, to 2.9% of GDP, after averaging a modest 0.5% of GDP between 1990 and 2004. In the context of the global economic and financial crisis, they slowed again in 2009-10 and have remained below the average level of 3.2% of GDP reached in 2006-08. Inflows of FDI, including sales of real estate to non-residents, declined to about US$13.5bn, or 1.5% of GDP, per year in 2012-14, before picking up to about US$19.3bn, or 2.2% of GDP, in 2015. In 2016-18 FDI inflows fell to an average of US$12.6bn, or 1.5% of GDP. In 2019 FDI inflows were subdued, at US$9.3bn, owing to high economic and policy uncertainty. In 2020 FDI inflows plunged again to US$7.8bn (or 1.1% of GDP, the lowest since 2004) amid the global recession and rising investor risk aversion towards emerging markets such as Turkey. The stock of inward FDI stood at just 29.3% of GDP in 2020 (US$210.2bn)-well below levels in regional competitors such as Romania and Poland (between 40-50% of GDP), and Bulgaria and Slovakia (75-80%). Turkish outward FDI jumped to US$7bn in 2014 (from US$3.6bn in 2013), largely reflecting a small number of large transactions, notably the acquisition of the UK-based United Biscuits by Yildiz Holding, a Turkish conglomerate of food manufacturers. The figure has eased since then, falling to a yearly average of US$3.1bn in 2019-20, presumably owing to high domestic funding needs.
Origin and distribution The traditional sources of foreign capital in Turkey have been multinational companies based in major European countries, especially the UK, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain and Germany, and in other OECD countries such as the US, Switzerland and Japan. Individual large investments from several smaller EU countries, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Brazil have amended this pattern in recent years, and there have also been some significant purchases by private-equity funds. A majority of foreign investment appears to go to Istanbul-the commercial capital where most national Turkish companies have their headquarters. Investment projects of foreign capital companies are overwhelmingly concentrated in the Marmara region (which includes Istanbul), the Aegean region, the Mediterranean and Ankara, the capital. Historically, manufacturing (particularly the chemicals, food and automotive industries) and financial services attracted the most FDI. In late 2018 BP, a British energy company, and the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) signed an agreement to form a joint venture to build and operate a petrochemicals plant in Turkey for US$1.8bn (construction is expected to be completed by 2023). Problems in developed economies, and the euro zone crisis in particular, together with the more recent deterioration in economic prospects in Turkey, have led to divestments by foreign financial institutions, many of which entered the Turkish market in 2005-08. As part of a plan to shore up its capital base, the National Bank of Greece has sold its 99.8% stake in Finans Bank, but because the sale, which was completed in mid-2016, was to Qatar National Bank, it did not affect net inward FDI figures in 2016. In 2017 OMV, an Austrian energy group, sold off its 100% stake in Petrol Ofisi, a Turkish petrol retailer. A neutral impact will also result from the planned sale of Denizbank by Sberbank to Emirates NBD (agreed in 2018). The Turkish lira crisis in 2018 delayed completion of the deal, but it was finalised in July 2019.
Foreign property purchases, which are included in balance-of-payments statistics for FDI, have been making a solid contribution to net inflows since 2005. In 2005-13 net inflows averaged a solid US$2.5bn per year, before picking up to an average of US$4.6bn in 2014-18. Amid excess supply, lira weakness and the deteriorating economic outlook, real estate inflows in US dollar terms continued to decline in 2019-20.
Determinants Foreign investment is mostly motivated by the size and potential of the Turkish market, but also increasingly because it offers access to neighbouring markets. The sharp rise in FDI in 2005-07 was partly driven by favourable global financial conditions, which have since evaporated. However, the upsurge was also made possible by the conjunction of several country-specific factors. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) was more willing than its predecessors to sell majority stakes in state-owned companies to foreigners. The economy was relatively stable and grew strongly, and EU accession talks, which were expected to lead to further reform of the business environment, got under way. The private sector was also more willing to seek foreign partners than in the past. This may have reflected the thinking of a new generation of management, strategies of specialisation in certain sectors, a desire to raise capital for privatisation bids, fear of increasing foreign competition, lost appetite for bank ownership and temptingly high company valuations. From 2008, although the government remained willing to privatise, market conditions deteriorated, resulting in less interest from foreign investors. Since 2013 potential deterrents have multiplied: less buoyant economic growth, mass anti-government protests, financial market volatility, government corruption allegations, the spillover of violence from the conflict in Syria, the collapse of the peace negotiations with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), an attempted military coup in July 2016 and increased social and political polarisation over the shift to a presidential system of government. Other significant structural deterrents, which vary by the sector, size and type of investment, include regulatory uncertainty, a slow and unpredictable judicial system, weak intellectual property (IP) protection and unfair competition from smuggled goods and the large informal sector. Such determinants are unlikely to change much over The Economist Intelligence Unit's forecast period (2021-25), although in order to attract much-needed FDI inflows, Turkey may start improving IP protection and clamp down on its large informal sector for tax revenue purposes.
Impact The FDI stock as a percentage of GDP is relatively low when compared with other emerging markets such as Brazil or Russia. However, FDI has accumulated over many decades, and the outlook compared with several central and east European countries has improved. Several leading multinationals, such as Unilever (UK-Netherlands) and Ford (US), have had a long-standing presence in Turkey, and companies with foreign partners play a significant role in the economy, helping to spread modern management and business practice. In the automotive industry, foreign investment has ensured expansion, technology transfer and access to global markets, although some lament the lack of national technology or a national trademark and the focus on production of low-end vehicles. By contrast, much recent FDI has taken the form of acquisitions of existing assets in domestically oriented sectors, and has therefore had a limited direct impact on fixed investment or exports. Foreign ownership of banks has not demonstrably improved either access to international funds or services and productivity, which were already advanced, and nor have fears been realised that foreign-owned banks may attach a greater risk premium than local banks to lending to the Turkish government or Turkish companies. The arrival of Vodafone (UK) has gradually helped to increase competition and investment in telecommunications, where Turkcell and Turk Telekom are dominant players. From a macroeconomic perspective, Turkey has relied on capital inflows, including FDI, to cover its large external financing requirement. In the years prior to the 2008-09 crisis, a growing share of FDI in capital inflows comforted the financial markets by reducing the vulnerability of the lira to trends in short-term capital inflows. In 2020 this ratio declined as FDI inflows dried up, but the share of FDI in capital inflows will improve during the latter part of our forecast period, helped by smaller-albeit still-large-external financing needs.
Potential Our baseline forecast is that, assuming security and policy concerns are addressed during the forecast period, there will be a moderate pick-up driven by further privatisation and other crossborder mergers and acquisitions, as well as foreign interest in residential and commercial property, following the easing of restrictions on foreign ownership of real estate in 2012. Although the surge in foreign acquisitions in telecoms and banking of 2006-07 is unrepeatable, private corporations in many sectors may still be open to foreign investment, and several major assets are yet to be privatised. We assume that the government will make further progress in creating conditions for private-sector investment in infrastructure in order to support economic growth over the longer term. The energy sector in particular has the potential to attract large amounts of foreign investment. Existing investors are likely to increase their investment through further acquisitions or projects, and some greenfield investment may take place. Subdued income growth may dampen foreign investors' earlier interest in retailing, but they may also become more active in other services, such as tourism, as well as in mining and agriculture. Investors from Asia and parts of the Middle East may play a larger role, in addition to Western multinationals and funds.

Population growth remains high by European standards Turkey is the third-largest country by population in Europe, after Russia and Germany. Official population figures have been compiled using an address-based registry since 2009. These figures are lower than previous estimates from door-to-door censuses, but are believed to be more reliable. The total population is projected to rise from 84.3m in 2020 to 86.7m in 2025, with the female population continuing to outnumber that of males. The total population is expected to grow by 0.6% per year during the forecast period (2021-25), compared with 1.4% during the historical period (2016-20). The pace of population growth has slowed in recent decades, mostly owing to the declining birth rate, which in turn reflects the combined impact on fertility rates of urbanisation, an improvement in the education level of women and wider use of birth control. Nevertheless, population growth remains high by European standards and the average age remains one of the lowest, at an estimated 32.8 years in 2020.
Infant mortality will continue to decline, but will be high From an average of 16.6 births per 1,000 inhabitants in 2016-20, the crude birth rate is expected to fall to an average of 15.4 per 1,000 in 2021-25. The infant mortality rate will continue to decline, but will remain high compared with European countries, as the national average is pulled up by the south-eastern and eastern regions, as well as by rural areas. The crude death rate will remain broadly unchanged, at an average of 5.5 per 1,000 population in 2021-25.
Although ageing, the Turkish population is young in a European context and will remain so throughout the forecast period. In 2020 those aged 14 and under were estimated to comprise 23.4% of the total population, and the 65-plus age group accounted for just 8.4%. In 2025 the share of under-15s will still be high, at about 21.5% of the population, and over-65s are expected to account for 9.9%.
Urban population will rise further owing to better conditions in cities The urban population, which is currently estimated at 76.2%, will rise further as rural families, insufficiently supported by agriculture, continue to seek better living standards in towns and cities. The drift of population from smaller and poorer urban settlements to larger and richer ones will also continue. As a result, all major cities in the west and south (including Ankara, the capital) will continue to grow rapidly. Although earthquake-prone, Istanbul and its surrounding area is likely to become the largest conurbation in Europe-the population was 15.5m at end-2020, up from about 12.6m at end-2007. Other cities and towns to witness particularly strong population growth include prosperous industrial centres like Bursa and Konya, and Antalya, on the Mediterranean coast.
The population of the mostly Kurdish-inhabited south-east, which accounts for about 10% of the total population, has increased steadily, despite strong outward migration. The still-high natural population growth rate in the region will contribute to the rapid expansion of the populations of cities like Gaziantep, Sanliurfa and Diyarbakir. By contrast, the populations of many rural areas in northern, eastern and central Turkey will dwindle. Even some of the larger urban centres in these poorer and more remote regions could lose population as birth rates slow and migration westwards and southwards continues. Some western and southern areas that are still classed as rural may maintain their populations as a result of intensive agriculture, tourism and/or proximity to major cities. This may also be true of lowland parts of the south east benefiting from irrigation schemes.
Participation rates will remain well below the OECD average Despite solid growth in the working-age population, Turkey has the lowest labour force participation rate of any OECD country. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat), it averaged 53.2% in 2018 (72.7% for men and just 34.2% for women), compared with an OECD average rate of more than 70%. Participation rates in urban areas are lower than in rural areas, reflecting that rural women are typically classified as "unpaid family workers" and are, therefore, counted as workforce participants and employed persons. Low workforce participation rates among urban women probably reflect inadequate job opportunities and the persistence of traditional gender roles. This situation is changing slowly, as illustrated by a gradual rise in recent years in the urban female participation rate. However, the rate is expected to remain low by European standards throughout the forecast period.

Overall spending power will rise, but income distribution will remain uneven The large consumer market is one of Turkey's chief attractions as a place to do business. The population is young, growing and inclined to consume rather than save, and average incomes are rising steadily in local-currency terms. In 2020 GDP per head was US$8,491 at market exchange rates (down from US$9,106 in 2019, reflecting Turkish lira weakness) and US$30,515 at purchasing power parity (PPP) rates (up from US$30,003 in 2019). Relative to other emerging markets, at PPP rates Turkey's GDP per head is broadly in line with that of Russia and Romania, and above that of Brazil and China. We expect Turkey's GDP per head to reach US$38,986 at PPP rates in 2025. At this level, GDP per head in Turkey will be broadly unchanged, at around 60% of the EU average.
Income distribution is uneven by European standards. According to the survey of incomes and living conditions by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat), the highest-earning 20% of households accounted for 46.3% of total income in 2019 (latest available data), up from 45.9% in 2014; the lowest-earning 20% of households accounted for 6.2%, down from 6.4% in 2014. Geographical factors contributed to the discrepancies. In general, the regions with the highest and most rapidly growing concentrations of population were also the wealthiest regions, except in the south-east, where spending power is low, partly as a result of continued confrontation between the central government and the Kurdish forces. Greater Istanbul, which accounts for about 20% of the population, represents about 25% of household consumption expenditure. By contrast, the statistical region of south-east Anatolia, with about 10% of the population, generated only about 6% of household consumption. Income and consumer expenditure also vary widely between urban and rural areas. These patterns are unlikely to change significantly in the forecast period (2021-25).
The household will remain the main consumption unit. Households typically consist of an average of 3.6 people, and more than 90% of households are made up of married couples. These patterns will change only slowly, the number of households will tend to rise faster than the population, underpinning medium-term demand for housing construction and household durables.
Majority of Turkish consumers aspire to Western-style consumer society A large majority of consumers aspire to "Western style" consumer society, in so far as their incomes permit, although local factors affect lifestyle aspirations. The country has wide variations in geography and climate, which affect diet, leisure activities and demand for certain goods.

The proportion of total household spending allocated to food, beverages and tobacco is high and expected to remain broadly stable during the forecast period. Turkish households have suffered from slow growth in 2020, resulting in a softer labour market and depressing purchasing power in US dollar terms. However, we expect Turkish households, which are dynamic by most European standards, to rebound to 2019 levels by 2023 and to grow strongly in 2024-25. The wealthiest households, which enjoy standards of living close to those in western Europe, spend significant amounts on entertainment, education and catering, as well as on transport, because of the high cost of running a car. These households will remain an important target market for environment-friendly and wellness products and services, which are relatively new. Other population segments are starting to provide additional demand for items that have been the prerogative of upper-income groups. Rising car ownership will continue to encourage supermarket shopping, residence in suburban areas and related lifestyle trends. Demand for branded fashion items, fast food, air conditioning and holidays is also spreading. That half of the population is under 30 will encourage the introduction of new products and services in communications, information and entertainment technology. Tourists constitute a significant addition to the consumer market. Assuming that perceived security risk does not increase again in the coming years, we expect the weaker lira to boost arrivals once the risks associated with the coronavirus abate.

Initial conditions: Some of the obstacles to solid and stable growth were removed in the decade to 2010, but in recent years the government has focused on domestic power struggles and the foreign policy challenges arising from turmoil in the wider region, putting economic reforms designed to boost investment and employment on hold. Given the deterioration of Turkey's institutions of governance and the likelihood that the current domestic political tensions will continue for some time, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects only limited progress on reforms in the near term, damaging Turkey's longer-term growth potential. For similar reasons, we do not expect Turkey's EU membership bid to make significant progress, making accession a remote prospect. A relatively low level of skills and quality of the workforce compared with Turkey's main competitors for foreign direct investment (FDI) in central and eastern Europe will continue to act as a deterrent to FDI, although Turkey will enjoy substantially more favourable demographics.
Working-age population growth turns negative in 2040 Demographic trends: On current projections, Turkey will have the second-largest national population in Europe (after Russia) by 2050, and, unlike in most European economies, Turkey's working-age population will continue to grow until the early 2040s and shrink thereafter amid a weaker demographic profile. Turkey's positive demographic dynamic is expected to start deteriorating from about 2030. In 2021-30 the difference between growth in the working-age population and that of the total population will be close to zero, before turning negative in 2031-50, which will dampen economic growth as it is not mitigated by improvements in productivity growth. This trend could be delayed if the bulk of 3.6m Syrian refugees currently being hosted in Turkey are integrated into the population.
Throughout the long-term forecast period (2021-50), we expect an upward trend in the labour force and employment because of rises in participation rates, given the low starting levels. With the workforce continuing to expand at a steady rate, it will be a challenge to produce sufficient jobs to lower the unemployment rate.
External conditions: International developments-particularly in international financial markets, the EU (Turkey's main export market) and in global terms of trade-will continue to affect Turkey's long-term economic performance. The coronavirus pandemic may result in higher risk aversion among investors over the long term, boding ill for Turkey, which highly relies on attracting capital inflows to support growth. We expect export-led industries to play an increasing role in growth. Turkey would benefit from greater global trade liberalisation, but the process of liberalisation is faltering and trade flows have slowed. In addition, over the long term Turkey may benefit from "near-shoring" trends, as the coronavirus pandemic is demonstrating that overly complex supply-chains can negatively affect growth. As a supplier of the developed economies, Turkey will face intense global competition, as low and medium value-added manufactured goods are likely to remain its main product lines. Its technology potential is relatively limited, and the country is not well placed to become a major supplier of services other than tourism and, to a lesser extent, construction, although improvements in (and diversification of) the domestic financial sector over the past decade may enable Turkey to develop as a provider of banking and insurance services in the wider region. Because of completed and planned pipeline construction, Turkey is expected to become a major energy hub between Russia, the Caspian region and western Europe. As Turkey shares borders with countries such as Iran, Syria and Iraq, its immediate regional environment is challenging, in particular from a security perspective.
Problems in the EU will dampen Turkey's interest in membership We do not expect Turkey to join the EU in our long-term forecast period, and there is a high probability that the accession negotiations may even be abandoned by one or both sides in this period. Given the limited progress so far in Turkey's EU accession negotiations, the strength of public opposition in most EU member states to Turkish membership and the economic and political challenges still facing the EU, we believe that Turkey's commitment to the goal of full EU membership will diminish even further. This increases the risk that government commitment to political and economic reform will weaken further. Harmonisation of Turkey's domestic legislation with EU norms is significantly more important for Turkey's long-term economic stability than actual member-ship. If the EU were to loosen its structure-the UK's vote to leave the EU could prompt such a move-opposition in the EU to Turkish accession might ease, increasing Turkey's chances of joining. However, this is not our core scenario.
Institutions and policy trends: Recep Tayyip Erdogan's victory in Turkey's first direct election of the president in August 2014, the approval of his presidential reform plan in a referendum in April 2017 and the presidential election of 2018 have shifted the political system from a parliamentary to a presidential system. The shift carries major implications for the country's future institutional and policy-setting framework. The constitutional reform allows Mr Erdogan to run for president for two five-year terms. However, discussions have begun on a new constitution, to be enacted next year. Details are not yet available, but it could include processes to ensure that Mr Erdogan stays in power beyond 2028, when his second term as president would end (assuming that he is re-elected in 2023). The issue of Mr Erdogan's succession as leader of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) and president of the country could become a source of instability during the long-term forecast period.
Considerable risk that economic policy is increasingly political The broadly positive management of the economy by the AKP since coming to power in 2002 has been one of the main reasons for its electoral successes. However, there is a considerable risk that economic policy will be increasingly tailored to political purposes rather than to maintain macroeconomic stability and further improvement of the business environment. Nevertheless, Turkey's public finances are structurally sounder following a decade of IMF-backed reforms in 1999-2008, which may allow the government more room to increase public investment in infrastructure and possibly to reduce tax rates. Given the little progress that we expect to be made in Turkey's EU accession negotiations, the problems of unpredictability and inefficiency in Turkey's legal and regulatory environment is expected to continue beyond 2025. Legislation is likely to remain under the scrutiny of the EU and international bodies, such as the IMF, the World Bank, the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights, although Mr Erdogan's assertive approach to foreign relations is likely to limit their influence over the direction of policies.
The government's peace negotiations with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed following the June 2015 election, and neither the PKK nor Mr Erdogan have shown any indication that they are willing to revive them any time soon. If the situation continues on its current trajectory, there is a real risk that the PKK and its affiliates will spread the conflict from the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited south-east of the country to Turkey's main cities in central and western regions, where the Kurdish population has grown rapidly in recent years. The mounting death toll will probably encourage Mr Erdogan to resort to increasingly authoritarian means to retain control.
Long-term performance: Turkey's economic growth performance is expected to exceed that of other emerging markets such as Brazil and Russia (but to be on a par with that of China) as a result of its more favourable demographic profile alongside large productivity increases. However, at a forecast average of 2.9% a year in 2021-50, real GDP growth will be well below average growth of 4.8% per year recorded in 2000-20. Average growth in GDP per head will be substantially lower, reflecting the expected rise in the total population. Income levels will remain well below the EU27 average, but some catch-up is likely. Improvements in the policy environment could produce substantially better results, but the changes in the political environment have created significant downside risks to the implementation of the necessary reforms.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Global land and ocean temperatures have been rising quickly since the 1980s, a trend that is widely attributed to growing greenhouse gas emissions from expanding human activity and population. This rise in average temperatures implies a higher number of extremely hot days in the summer period, as well as higher minimum temperatures that will lead to greater electricity consumption and a heavier burden on health services due to temperature-related illnesses and parasitic diseases that thrive in warmer climates.
Precipitation in the eastern Mediterranean has been declining steadily over the past decades and is expected to continue falling, raising the probability of extremely dry spells of weather. In 1998-2012 the eastern Mediterranean Levant (Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria and Turkey) experienced the worst drought in 900 years. In Turkey, in 2007 this resulted in water restrictions being imposed in the capital, Ankara, with some residents losing access for up to ten days. It also resulted in Turkey's agricultural output contracting by nearly 7% year on year and the government having to provide grants to affected farmers to compensate for the losses. In the future limited average rainfall is likely to be accompanied by torrential precipitation, such as in 2018-19, with devastating consequences for infrastructure and agricultural output.
The Turkish government has recently taken some steps to mitigate the weakness posed by the country's geographical location. In 2010 the government established a national climate change strategy that included improved disaster mitigation plans and improved efficiency in water management. Specifically, a substantial number of dams have been built, and efforts have been made to improve some of the highly inefficient irrigation and water supply systems. Although such measures may help to mitigate the effects of climate change, they may also create foreign policy challenges. The construction of several damns along the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers, which feed water into Iraq and Syria, has the potential to increase significantly tensions with these neighbouring countries. In 2019 we developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth, and we expect that, despite the mitigation efforts, real GDP will be 2.8% smaller by 2050 than it would have otherwise been.
Technological development The integration of advanced technologies in Turkey's economy is proceeding at a fast pace, but from a relatively low base. E-commerce, computer ownership and internet access have increased rapidly in the past decade. Yet, despite this progress, Turkey remains far behind the technological frontier. According to The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings, Turkey ranks joint 50th with Greece, Thailand and Costa Rica in the global rankings for technological readiness. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2019, Turkey ranks 61st overall, but 69th in terms of information and communications technology (ICT) adoption, which includes criteria such as the percentage of internet users. The country ranks just 64th in internet usage and 59th in fixed-broadband technologies.
Across sectors, large, export-oriented private-sector firms tend to be the most technologically intensive. Firms in the automotive sector, usually structured as joint partnerships between Turkish conglomerates and major global auto producers, are a major driver of research and development (R&D) expenditure. Ford Otosan, the joint venture of Ford, a US-based car manufacturer, in Turkey has become a global hub for Ford's commercial vehicle development and output. In 2015 the company opened a US$25m R&D unit-Turkey's largest, employing about 1,500 engineers. Oyak-Renault, a joint venture between Renault, a French car manufacturer, and Oyak, the Turkish armed forces pension fund, won government financial support worth US$100m to support hybrid investments at its Bursa plant.
Turkey's technological prospects are unclear. The country has a young, dynamic labour pool, but Turkey's education system is inadequate at providing the skills demanded by employers. In fact, this is regularly one of businesses' top complaints. In addition, in recent years many of Turkey's most educated young people have emigrated abroad, which will make attracting top foreign talent and further foreign direct investment (FDI) more difficult.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2016-20) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2021-25). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2016-20. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2021-25 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2016-20 ranges are then used to derive 2021-25 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2021-25, not to the likely situation in 2025 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2018 or 2023). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, to complete a first term in 2024 and run for a second term, but he could face a challenge for the leadership of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) at its five-yearly electoral summit in December 2022 in the absence of a post-pandemic economic rebound, with victory not assured.
- The economic and social damage wrought by the global coronavirus pandemic, alongside the need for urgent remedial action, will help to build support within the ANC for the president's reformist agenda, albeit reluctantly in some cases.
- Policy will focus on vaccine rollouts, infrastructure investment (led by the private sector) and combatting electricity shortages. Fiscal constraints point to an increased reliance on public-private partnerships for key projects. The fightback against corruption will gather momentum in 2021, as shown by the ANC's suspension of its secretary-general, Ace Magashule, in May for defying orders to step aside.
- Following a severe recession in 2020, with real GDP shrinking by 7% because of the pandemic, we expect a modest return to growth of 2.4% in 2021, helped by low interest rates and higher commodity prices, although power supply constraints, still-weak tourism and jobs lost to the pandemic will preclude a more rapid rebound. We envisage growth quickening to 2.7% a year on average in 2022-25, underpinned by structural reforms, but unemployment will continue to weigh on aggregate demand.
- Cumulative interest-rate cuts in 2020 cut the benchmark rate to 3.5%, providing relief to borrowers, but another reduction is unlikely. We expect interest rates to remain on hold until a small rise in late 2021 or early 2022.
- After easing to a multi-year low of 3.2% in 2020, average inflation will rise to 3.7% in 2021, owing to costlier oil and electricity, but weak demand will keep price growth subdued. Inflation will quicken to 4.5% a year on average in 2022-25 as economic growth stages a gradual post-pandemic recovery.
- South Africa recorded a rare current-account surplus in 2020 of 2.2% of GDP as exports fell more slowly than imports, pushing up the merchandise trade surplus. Trends in 2021, including buoyant exports, point to another (albeit smaller) current-account surplus, before the return of a deficit in 2022-25 as imports regain traction.

- South Africa's business environment score improves for 2021-25, although its global ranking drops by one and its regional ranking is unchanged from 2016-20. Market opportunity and infrastructure gains will be partly offset by deteriorations in macroeconomic stability and taxation.

Country forecast overview: South Africa's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: A post-pandemic investment drive, focused on infrastructure, facilitates public-private partnerships. Challenges include tighter competition laws and stricter black economic empowerment (BEE) rules.
2023-25: Expropriation without compensation, to speed up land reform, applies in limited circumstances only, reducing the threat to property rights. Investment incentives in selected industries (such as automotive manufacturing) remain in place.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: A reworked mining charter offers some concessions to business. A new foreign investment law limits access to international arbitration by giving local courts the primary responsibility for handling disputes.
2023-25: The government continues to encourage foreign investment and public-private partnerships, but resists the full privatisation of state assets in most cases.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: The government implements a further relaxation of capital controls on outward investment and other flows.
2023-25: Progress towards regional economic integration in Southern Africa makes some advances, but barriers persist.
Taxes 2021-22: Despite tough fiscal conditions, the government avoids major tax increases to shield households and firms.
2023-25: Efforts to streamline and modernise the tax system and expand the tax base continue.
Financing 2021-22: Cuts in the benchmark interest rate and other liquidity-boosting measures help to support banks and firms during the pandemic. Local banks remain sound and a major source of corporate financing, despite profits being squeezed.
2023-25: The continued independence of the South African Reserve Bank (the central bank) helps to preserve financial system stability. Monetary policy remains prudent and interest rates edge higher. The proposed nationalisation of the central bank is symbolic.
The labour market 2021-22: Pandemic-induced job losses oblige trade unions to accept a mild relaxation of currently inflexible labour laws.
2023-25: The labour market remains tough, owing to skills shortages and BEE targets.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Investment in transport and electricity, led in many cases by private firms, boosts capacity.
2023-25: Private-sector-led investment in renewable energy gathers momentum under the government's long-term energy plan, adding diversity to power supplies and cutting reliance on coal. Rising power tariffs drive energy efficiency.
Technological readiness 2021-22: The rollout of domestic fibre-optic cables boosts capacity and cuts costs. Investment in digital technology gathers momentum, including in cloud computing and high-end data analysis. The allocation of new spectrum boosts capacity
2023-25: Work advances on the Square Kilometre Array-a powerful radio telescope with multinational support-giving a wider boost to science and to information and communications technology.

Background: South Africa became a full democracy in 1994, when it first held all-race elections. The African National Congress (ANC) won, and has dominated all subsequent elections-in 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019. However, support ebbed steadily from a peak of nearly 70% in 2004, to 62.1% in 2014 and 57.5% in May 2019. The ANC feared a worse result in 2019, but the installation of Cyril Ramaphosa as president in February 2018, replacing the scandal-tainted Jacob Zuma, provided a mild bounce. Barring shocks, Mr Ramaphosa will serve a full five-year term ending in 2024 and would be eligible for a second term.
Political structure: South Africa is a constitutional democracy with a bicameral parliament and a president elected by parliament. The constitution is the supreme law. The National Assembly is elected by proportional representation; the National Council of the Provinces consists of indirectly elected representatives of the nine provinces. The judiciary is independent and includes an 11-member Constitutional Court. The constitution provides for an independent corruption watchdog-the Public Protector-and commissions on human rights, gender equality and restitution of land rights.
Policy issues: The main policy focus in 2021-25 will be to facilitate recovery from a severe recession in 2020, caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The need to boost post-pandemic growth will allow Mr Ramaphosa to push ahead more forcefully with his reformist agenda. A new economic recovery and reconstruction plan will focus on investment in critical infrastructure (such as housing and transport), led by the private sector, alongside a large-scale public works programme to create jobs. Tackling power shortages by commissioning new capacity from independent power producers, and by restructuring Eskom, the highly-indebted electricity parastatal, is another key objective. Fiscal constraints point to an increased reliance on public-private partnerships, despite resistance from vested interests. A new draft expropriation bill sets clear limits on when compensation is not payable, thus diminishing the threat to property rights and investor confidence. Challenges include skills shortages, stricter competition laws and the perennial risk of strikes.
Taxation: Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a flat rate of 15%-after a rise from 14% on April 1st 2018-although some essentials are zero-rated. Corporation tax (of 28%), income tax and VAT were left unchanged in the 2021/22 budget but a corporation tax cut is earmarked for 2022/23. Some tax concessions are available, including in special economic zones.
Foreign trade: South Africa has a relatively open economy, with foreign trade (imports plus exports) accounting for about 52% of GDP. China, the EU, the US and Japan are among its largest trading partners. Trade with the rest of Africa has become progressively more important and makes a large contribution to South Africa's merchandise trade surplus.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability Recovering from the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and a deep recession in 2020 will confront South Africa with unparalleled challenges, but the growing authority of the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has positive implications for political stability and economic reform. On the pandemic front, new cases and deaths have remained low and stable since a deadly second wave faded in February, but there are risks of a resurgence. Vaccination will be rolled out in May before gaining momentum in July-December, but a range of global bottlenecks in the vaccine production supply chain means that timely delivery is not assured. South Africa consequently faces the threat of a third wave of Covid-19 during the southern hemisphere winter (June-August), which could stifle the economic recovery and aggravate social tensions ahead of nationwide municipal elections in October.
Since being elected for a five-year term in May 2019 Mr Ramaphosa has struggled to unite the disparate factions of the ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC), behind a reformist agenda, but a severe recession in 2020, accompanied by heavy job losses and rising poverty, is changing the political dynamic. After several years of policy fudges to appease powerful interest groups (such as labour unions), the need for urgent action to repair the economy-including by working more closely with the private sector-is boosting support for the president's agenda. The two main sources of resistance to Mr Ramaphosa within the ANC are left-wing interventionists-which will remain wedded to a strong state role in the economy-and the so-called radical economic transformation movement that emerged during the presidency of Jacob Zuma (2009-18), which is blamed for facilitating corruption and patronage under the guise of black economic empowerment.
In a key victory for Mr Ramaphosa over the pro-Zuma faction in early May, the ANC's National Executive Committee suspended the party's secretary-general, Ace Magashule, after he defied a new rule requiring members formally charged with corruption (and other serious crimes) to stand aside from their positions. Given the powerful role played by the secretary-general in choosing election candidates and organising key summits, Mr Magashule's suspension (ahead of his next court appearance in August), gives Mr Ramaphosa a valuable opportunity to reshape party structures and policies, and escalate the fight against corruption. In a further blow to the radicals, Mr Zuma risks being jailed either for defying a Constitutional Court order to appear before an inquiry into state capture (being led by the deputy chief justice, Raymond Zondo) or on long-standing corruption charges linked to an arms deal, which moves to a full trial in May.
The left, while still clamouring for wage rises, is now resigned to a more prominent role for the private sector and the restructuring of dysfunctional parastatal firms, in view of the state's financial and technical capacity constraints. Heavy job losses are inevitably weakening trade unions' influence in both the private and the public sectors, obliging them to compromise in many cases. Policy debates will continue but Mr Ramaphosa's tighter grip on the ANC will mean that the structural reforms needed to bolster economic growth and job creation will take place.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch The next major political event is the ANC's five-yearly National General Council (NGC)-a policy implementation review-which will give a clearer indication of the balance of forces in the party and the extent of Mr Ramaphosa's control. After being delayed by more than a year by the pandemic, the NGC's timing is still uncertain, although The Economist Intelligence Unit expects it to take place before the next five-yearly municipal elections on October 27th 2021. The nationwide ballot will give voters the first chance to judge the government's pandemic response and will be a test of Mr Ramaphosa's and the ANC's popularity. A voting share for the ANC in the 55-60% range in 2021 (compared with 57.5% in the 2019 general election) would be seen as satisfactory, but a drop into the 50-55% range could see Mr Ramaphosa face a leadership challenge at the ANC's next electoral summit in December 2022. We expect the ANC, under Mr Ramaphosa, to retain power at the next general election (in 2024), but with a smaller majority than in 2019. The implementation of a new Political Party Funding Act from April 2021 will strengthen transparency.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations South Africa-the most advanced economy in Africa and a major business hub-will remain deeply engaged in the continent, particularly in Southern and East Africa. Despite a challenging environment, South Africa will continue to attract international companies, including from the US, Europe and Asia, owing to strong institutions, sound banks and its role as continental gateway. South Africa's commercial involvement in other African markets will remain broad-based, covering mining, banking, telecommunications, retail and hospitality. The pandemic is causing temporary disruption to regional relations because of border closures and flight bans, aggravated by a second wave of infections, but regional access for South Africa-based firms will improve in 2021, helped by vaccine rollouts.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends The most immediate policy challenge facing the government is to revive the economy following the pandemic-induced contraction in 2020. Containment measures have been alternatively tightened and loosened since the pandemic erupted-with the latest move, to level one, the most relaxed, taking place on March 1st-but the cost of the pandemic in terms of lost jobs and income remains heavy. A second wave of infections, driven by a new, more transmissible viral variant, led to more cases and deaths in December/January than during the first peak in July/August 2020, but the figures have since remained low and stable. A vaccine rollout will gather pace from May onwards but widespread immunisation is unlikely in South Africa until later in 2021, given global shortages, which increases the risk of a third wave of Covid-19.
The government will attempt to engineer a growth rebound in 2021-25, via targeted measures and deeper structural reforms, although the scope for additional monetary and fiscal intervention is limited. With the benchmark interest rate at a record low of 3.5%, there is little room for further cuts, and several years of heavy spending and rising budget deficits preclude broad-based fiscal stimulus. Even before the pandemic South Africa was trapped in a low-growth trajectory-not for the want of pro-growth plans, but because of policy fudges between left-wing and pro-business factions and weak implementation. The pandemic, by exposing underlying weaknesses (such as widespread poverty and inequality) and by highlighting the need for urgent action, will be a catalyst for deeper and more rapid structural reforms, including a greater role for the private sector.
Devised in consultation with business and organised labour, an economic recovery and reconstruction plan will focus on job creation-via large-scale public works programmes-and infrastructure investment. The plan aims to channel R100bn (US$6.8bn) over ten years into an infrastructure fund with the aim of attracting a ten times greater sum from the private sector via public-private partnerships. Projects already identified include housing and network infrastructure. Restoring energy security by adding new capacity (mostly solar and wind) from independent power producers is a key target, as is the planned auction of new broadband spectrum in 2021, which will boost communication and digitalisation. Despite these encouraging signs, it is unlikely that the first major additional increments to power supply will come on stream until mid-2022. New renewable capacity, comprising solar and wind, will be the quickest to materialise. Nevertheless, solar projects typically take from 18 months to two years from inception to completion; the timeframe for wind schemes ranges from two to three years. Other schemes, such as those for gas, are likely to take longer. As a result, further episodes of load-shedding appear likely over the next two years, before the situation improves later in the forecast period. Restructuring dysfunctional parastatal firms is another central priority. Implementation remains a challenge, but the political will to act is now stronger. Commitments to the IMF in return for a rapid financing instrument (RFI) in July 2020 will add impetus to reforms in the face of resistance from vested interests. We expect economic policy to support medium-term growth momentum and to help the country to emerge from secular stagnation.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy A surge in the budget deficit in fiscal year 2020/21 (April-March) reflects heavy revenue losses and higher spending during the pandemic and recession. The 2020/21 shortfall was, nonetheless, smaller than the deficit of 15.7% of GDP predicted by the Treasury, because of a belated revenue boost from higher commodity prices, alongside gains from an overhaul of the South African Revenue Service (the tax agency). The brighter revenue outlook means than planned tax hikes in 2021/22 are expected to be put on hold and a vaccine rollout costing an initial R9bn (US$620m) over two years is fully funded. The budget for 2021/22, unveiled in February, outlines a path of medium-term fiscal consolidation premised on public-sector wage restraint. We expect the shortfall as a percentage of GDP to ebb to 9.2% in 2021/22 and 7.5% in 2022/23, before easing to 3.5% in 2025/26. The biggest risks to fiscal consolidation are a fightback by labour unions against wage restraint (via a combination of legal action, political pressure and possible strikes) and the heavy debt burdens of parastatal enterprises.
After surging to about 78% at end-2020/21 because of higher borrowing and a recession, the public debt/GDP ratio will rise more slowly as fiscal revenue recovers, peaking at about 87.4% of GDP at end-2023/25, before easing to 82.9% at end-2025/26. Fiscal consolidation will reduce South Africa's risk of debt distress, as will the government's recourse to deep and liquid domestic capital markets to finance most of the budget shortfalls. Debt-servicing costs will continue rising, however, leaving limited room for slippage on either the spending or the revenue fronts. A failure to meet debt targets could oblige South Africa to undertake a formal IMF programme with strict conditions attached.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy Policy accommodation during the 2020 pandemic crisis will give way to a normalisation process in 2022, with interest rates edging higher as the economy begins to recover. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB, the central bank) cut the benchmark interest rate (repo rate) five times in 2020-most recently in July-by a cumulative 300 basis points to 3.5%, to help to shield the economy from the pandemic. However, the rate has since remained on hold, reflecting limited scope for additional loosening. We expect the SARB to maintain its current stance throughout most of 2021, but the expected resumption of real GDP growth and a mild inflation upswing point to a small rate rise in early 2022 or later. Additional small increases will follow in 2023-25, broadly tracking US trends.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth Following a steep contraction of 7% in 2020 because of the pandemic impact, we now expect real GDP to grow by 2.4% in 2021 (revised up from 2%), signalling a still-moderate rebound. The upward revision reflects an improved outlook for vaccine provision (after the government agreed contracts with Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer), higher commodity prices, stronger export demand, another good farm season and the maintenance of low interest rates. Several factors will dampen the rebound in 2021, however, including a probable year-on-year economic contraction in the first quarter (because of the mostly pre-pandemic baseline), electricity supply constraints, a sluggish recovery in tourism and hospitality, and elevated unemployment, which will sap aggregate demand. In addition, downside risks include public-sector strikes in response to a pay freeze, and a third wave of Covid-19 during the southern hemisphere winter (June-August), which would stifle the pace of recovery.
Given that a rebound in 2021 largely reflects a very weak baseline in 2020, our growth forecast for 2022 is unchanged at 2.2%, implying a slight slowdown. The economy will benefit in 2022 from a relaxation of power supply constraints from mid-year (after the planned commissioning of new generating capacity) and from stronger private investment in response to favourable policy initiatives, such as moves to facilitate public-private partnerships. Hurdles to growth in 2022 will be a global slowdown (after a 2021 rebound), persistently high unemployment and still-fragile tourism. We expect growth to strengthen to 2.8% a year on average in 2023-25, underpinned by long-delayed reforms (such as parastatal restructuring) and the spread of digital technology, but the global backdrop will remain subdued in terms of economic growth and trade flows.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation After dipping to a multi-year low of 3.2% in 2020, owing to recession, cheaper imported oil and a bumper food harvest, inflation will edge up to 3.7% in 2021, but will remain comfortably within the SARB's 3-6% target range. The primary sources of inflation in 2021 will be higher oil prices and costlier electricity tariffs, although the prospect of a second consecutive bumper harvest in the 2020/21 season will offset higher global food prices. Other factors curbing inflation are mild rand appreciation in 2021, weak aggregate demand (owing to unemployment and income losses), spare industrial capacity and strong retail competition. We expect inflation to quicken to an average of 4.5% a year in 2022-25, spurred by a modest revival in GDP growth, but the level will stay within the SARB's target range, temporary breaches aside.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates Stronger commodity prices and global liquidity injections will support the rand in 2021, as shown by a 22.4% year-on-year appreciation of the currency to R14.41:US$1 in April, its strongest level since before the pandemic. Being commodity-dependent, widely traded and an emerging-market proxy, the rand will benefit from a positive global backdrop, but remain vulnerable to any adverse shifts in global sentiment and to negative domestic developments. We see the rand weakening from current levels, in view of South Africa's large fiscal deficit and sluggish growth outlook-alongside potential global tensions-ending 2021 at R16.16:US$1 (revised from R16.61:US$1). On an annual average basis, we forecast strengthening to R15.39:US$1 in 2021 (revised from R15.77:US$1) as markets normalise after disruption in 2020. The rand will remain volatile, often experiencing large daily movements in response to shifting sentiment, although South Africa's modest external debt stock and healthy foreign-exchange reserves are protective. Our forecast assumes gradual depreciation from 2022 onwards, with the rand slipping to R19.07:US$1 at end-2025, although the pace of decline will be close to the inflation rate, implying a drop in real effective exchange rate.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector The impact of the pandemic on the external accounts will persist in 2021, and we expect another rare current-account surplus and a net contribution to GDP growth. The pandemic led to a much steeper fall in imports than in exports in 2020, generating a large merchandise trade surplus, which offset the perennial deficit on invisible trade to produce a current-account surplus of 2.2% of GDP. In 2021 a healthy increase in export earnings (underpinned by higher commodity prices) will be outweighed by a rebound in imports as the economy recovers (and oil prices rise), reducing the merchandise trade surplus and the current-account surplus (to 1.5% of GDP). Our forecast for 2023-25 envisages a return to a current-account deficit, with the shortfall averaging 2.6% of GDP a year, as the invisible trade deficit (underpinned by income outflows to foreign investors) surpasses the merchandise trade surplus. The current-account deficit will be smaller than pre-pandemic levels but will leave South Africa reliant on financial inflows to plug the gap.
Foreign direct investment inflows will recover from 2021, helped by structural reforms to boost public-private partnerships, including private investment in parastatal enterprises. We expect inflows of US$5.2bn a year on average (just under 10% of gross financing needs). South Africa will remain a key base for multinational companies with pan-African operations by offering a range of services, including banking, capital-raising and trade-related functions.

Full text: - Following the general election in December 2019, the Conservative Party led by Boris Johnson has an 87-seat working majority in parliament. This majority will be robust to any changes in parliament, and The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to last its full term until 2024. The UK left the EU on January 31st, 2020, and left the single market and customs union on January 1st 2021, entering into a more limited trade agreement. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus was the government's primary focus in 2020, and managing the recovery from the pandemic and ensuing recession will dominate the government's priorities in the coming years. Adjusting to a political and economic order outside the EU will also lead to significant political changes, not least in managing separatist sentiment in Scotland and maintaining the peace in Northern Ireland which is threatened by post-Brexit trade frictions.

- The UK's score in the business environment rankings rises in the forecast period (2021-25) compared with the historical period (2016-20), reflecting receding Brexit and coronavirus uncertainties. The UK rises by one place in the regional ranking, but remains in 17th place globally. The macroeconomic environment will improve as the pandemic abates, with the UK's strong consumer base driving the recovery. Increased trade barriers between the UK and the rest of Europe will constrain growth in the short term, but the UK's traditional strengths-a pro-business policy orientation, a fairly low burden of regulation, and flexible labour and product markets-will support the recovery. Structural deficits such as weak productivity and inadequate intermediate skills will probably persist.

- Real GDP fell by 9.9% in 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, one of the worst global outturns. A successful vaccination campaign and pent-up demand will lead to strong catch-up growth in 2021 and 2022, with GDP returning to pre-crisis levels in late 2022. Over the medium term, growth will be constrained by weaker export growth post-Brexit, lacklustre investment and productivity growth, and an increased tax burden.

- The coronavirus has led to significant one-off changes in UK demographics during 2020 and 2021, with a significant increase in excess deaths owing to the coronavirus pandemic, and a significant net out-migration of foreign workers, estimated at more than a million. Once these forces abate, the UK population is forecast to grow at an annual average rate of 0.4% in 2021-25, supported by natural change (an excess of births over deaths) and net immigration. The UK's rate of population growth, both in terms of natural increase and immigration, has exceeded the EU average. The government has introduced a new skills-based immigration system, which we expect to reduce net inflows of citizens from the EU, but this is likely to be offset by increased arrivals from non-EU countries. Softer labour force growth and an ageing population will imply a rising share of public expenditure on healthcare, social care and pension-related spending.

- The coronavirus is likely to lead to a significant transformation of the UK's retail sector, which will stimulate growth: there will be an accelerated shift to online services and a glut of household savings will be drawn down over several years. The departure of the UK from the single market will have a negative impact on the export sector. However, despite heightened uncertainty, the large, rich and flexible UK economy will continue to provide opportunities for inward investors and global exporters.

Background: The end of the second world war coincided with the decline of the UK as an imperial power. Residual links with former colonial territories, close relations with the US and a separate sense of identity delayed UK membership of the European Community (now the EU) until 1973. Successive governments resisted closer EU integration. Following a 2016 referendum on EU membership, the UK left the EU single market and customs union in January 2021 The future contours of the UK's relationship with the EU are in flux, but a diminution of UK influence in the region appears to be inevitable.
Political structure: The UK is a constitutional monarchy. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II. Parliament has an elected House of Commons (the lower house, 650 seats) and a non-elected House of Lords (the upper house, non-fixed membership of about 800). The snap general election in December 2019 produced a majority government for the centre-right Conservative Party, which won 365 seats. The main opposition Labour Party won 202 seats, with smaller parties winning the remaining 83. This government is likely to serve out its full term until the next scheduled election, in 2024.
Policy issues: The coronavirus outbreak has dominated UK politics since March 2020. The government embarked on massive fiscal expansion to support workers and businesses affected by the virus and containment measures, while the Bank of England (the central bank) has moved rates to record-lows, which is likely to persist into 2022. The government expects to begin fiscal consolidation in 2022, although headline debt will remain high as a percentage of GDP. Supporting industries affected by increased Brexit-related trade frictions will dominate UK policymaking. Maintaining competitiveness in this environment will force policymakers to address structural deficiencies such as low productivity.
Taxation: The headline rate of corporation tax has been reduced steadily, from 28% in 2010 to 19%, since April 2018. There are three bands of personal income tax, set at 20%, 40% and 45% (the 45% rate came into effect in April 2013, replacing the 50% rate introduced in 2010). The standard rate of value-added tax (VAT) is 20% (raised from 17.5% in 2011). Excise duties on tobacco and alcohol are among the highest in Europe.
Foreign trade: In 2020 exports of goods totalled an estimated US$399bn and imports amounted to US$548bn, resulting in a trade deficit of US$149bn. The services surplus expanded to US$138bn. The overall current-account widened in absolute terms, from US$87.6bn in 2019 to US$95.4bn, widening as a share of GDP, from 3.1% to 3.5%.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance The UK is a parliamentary democracy. The legislature consists of an elected lower chamber, the House of Commons (650 seats), and an unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords (about 775 members), which was partly reformed in 1999. Pending a second stage of reform, most members of the House of Lords are appointed life peers. Following the most recent election in December 2019, the centre-right Conservative Party formed a majority government under the prime minister, Boris Johnson, with 365 of the 650 seats in parliament. The opposition Labour Party suffered its worst result since 1935, holding only 202 seats. The third-largest party is the Scottish National Party (SNP), winning 48 of Scotland's 59 seats. The remainder of the parliamentary seats are held by the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party, and several Northern Irish parties. The next election is scheduled for 2024, and we do not expect an early election given the size of the Conservative majority.

Political outlook: Political stability At the general election on December 12th 2019, the Conservative Party, under the prime minister, Boris Johnson, won an 80-seat majority. On January 31st 2020 Mr Johnson fulfilled his campaign promise to take the UK out of the EU, ending 47 years of EU membership. On January 1st 2021 the UK left the EU's single market and customs union after negotiating a free-trade agreement. The government is currently managing the implementation of a new trading relationship with the EU while addressing the fallout from the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Despite the challenges posed by these two issues, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the government to last a full term.
The spread of the coronavirus in early 2020 put the government on a crisis-management footing. In March 2020 it instructed a strict lockdown for over three months. After a relaxation of restrictions in the summer, the government implemented a second lockdown in England between November and December. The spread of a new, significantly more contagious variant of the virus led the government to impose a third, more severe lockdown in January 2021, with schools and non-essential businesses being closed. Restrictions are now gradually being unwound, with phased reopening in five-week intervals: non-essential retail reopened on April 12th, with most hospitality to follow on May 17th and all remaining restrictions to be lifted on June 21st. The government is undertaking a mass vaccination programme; more than 67% of the adult population had received at least one dose of vaccine by May 8th. Devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have enacted similar restrictions during these periods.
Brexit and the pandemic have increased the medium-term risk to the integrity of the UK. Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), has argued that Brexit represents a material change in the relationship between Scotland and the UK since the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence where a majority favoured the continuation of the union. Support for Scottish independence spiked during the initial phase of the pandemic, as Scottish voters viewed their devolved government's response as more effective than that of the UK government. This has ebbed since the beginning of the vaccination campaign and, more recent polls now show a narrow lead for support for the union, although within the margin of error.
The SNP, along with the pro-independence Scottish Green Party have held a majority in the Scottish Parliament since 2016, and made modest gains in the most recent elections in May 2021, which Ms Sturgeon claims gives her a mandate to pursue a second referendum. The UK government has called for a summit on the future of the union; however, we do not believe these gains will provide sufficient political pressure to force the government to grant a second referendum in this parliament. Even if the UK government were to grant a second referendum, it would take several years to organise. Furthermore, divisions within pro-independence parties may undermine the unity of the movement. As a result, we believe that there are significant obstacles to Scotland becoming independent and do not expect it to happen during our forecast period.
Brexit has inflamed tensions in Northern Ireland. The UK and the EU agreed to a separate protocol for Northern Ireland to avoid border checks with the Republic of Ireland. Under this agreement, Northern Ireland is remaining within a regulatory union with the EU for most goods. Although it will stay in the UK customs and value-added tax (VAT) areas, customs and VAT checks are to be conducted by the UK on the EU's behalf at ports in the Irish Sea for goods bound for the EU. This requires the construction and implementation of checkpoints and border infrastructure between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK for all goods deemed by a UK-EU joint committee to be "at risk" of passing into the EU.
This arrangement has been difficult to implement, and is disliked by unionist Northern Irish politicians for ostensibly creating a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. On April 2nd sustained rioting broke out in Northern Ireland for over a week. These protests originated among unionist communities partly in opposition to the Irish Sea border checks. This breakdown in order has intensified talks between the UK and EU around how to implement the Northern Ireland protocol. This had become a source of friction, with the EU launching legal action against the UK for unilaterally extending a series of grace periods for implementing customs checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Despite these tensions, we expect that the Northern Ireland protocol will remain in place, given the commitments by both sides to not recreate a hard customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. However, tensions will remain high, with the ongoing risk of further violence.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness The next five years are likely to be a period of significant political, institutional and constitutional change in the UK. The government has acquired significant new public health powers to enforce lockdown and social distancing requirements for the duration of the pandemic and developed significant spending schemes for paying workers' wages and supporting businesses during lockdown. This has been backstopped by a robust bond-buying programme from the Bank of England (the central bank). The movement of additional competencies for economic policymaking from the EU to the UK, combined with the aftermath of the pandemic, will lead to significant pressure for change within the UK's political and institutional system and put it under severe strain.
Brexit and Covid have challenged the four UK nations' relationships The pandemic has had significant consequences for devolution-the transfer of powers from the central state to Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish and regional authorities, which has been an evolving process since the 1990s. Public health is a devolved competency, and the Scottish government, led by the SNP, and Welsh government, led by the Labour Party, have taken public health approaches that often diverged from the policies followed by the central government for England, including in areas such as international travel restrictions, which would normally be handled by the central government. Brexit is also likely to exacerbate this trend, as the disapplication of EU law creates more latitude for policy divergence among the constituent nations.
The future of devolution within the UK is likely to come into question in the coming years. The devolution of public health and education powers to the constituent countries of the UK was highlighted during the pandemic. The lack of a devolved government for England, by far the largest of the constituent countries, has meant that the central UK government has found itself increasingly making policy for England alone, while the Scottish and Welsh publics engaged more with their devolved authorities than the central government. Disparate approaches to handling the pandemic in some areas also highlighted conflict between the central Conservative-led government, and the SNP and Labour party governments in Scotland and Wales respectively, as well as local Labour-led city and regional governments in England.
In the absence of EU rules post-Brexit, the central government will need to provide consistency in the legal framework within the UK's internal market. It has retained or reasserted control over most competencies around product and market regulation at a UK level. However, in Scotland, in particular, such an approach may encourage resentment of the Westminster government among nationalist voters. The UK government can impose legislation on Scotland, but this would overturn two decades (since the latest phase of devolution began in 1997) of constitutional convention and would risk inflaming pro-independence sentiment. The central government still controls most revenue-raising decisions, and funded the furlough and other extraordinary fiscal support schemes centrally, suggesting that future clashes over taxation and spending authority between the central and devolved authorities are likely.
Tensions in Northern Ireland have increased over the Brexit protocol Northern Ireland faces many of the same issues around devolution but these frictions have been exacerbated by tensions over Brexit and lingering sectarian divisions. The erection of customs checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK has restricted the ability of traders to remain in the Northern Irish market and prompted rioting by members of the Unionist community. Dissatisfaction with the Northern Ireland protocol among Unionists led to the resignation in May 2021 of the first minister, Arlene Foster, a moderate, who is likely to be replaced by a more radical leader staunchly opposed to the UK-EU protocol. The outbreak of violence has prompted an intensification of negotiations between the UK and EU aimed at making the protocol work more effectively. However, there is a significant risk that these talks will not improve matters, leading to an abandonment of the protocol by the UK. The next elections for the Northern Irish Assembly in 2022 may see additional gains for the Nationalists if the Unionist vote remains fragmented, leading to further political instability.
Constitutional reform over elections appears inevitable. Elections are currently governed by the 2010 fixed-term parliaments act (FTPA), which requires either a two-thirds vote or the loss of a no-confidence vote to hold an election before the five-year term of a parliament elapses. However, in 2019 this had the effect of creating a prolonged impasse in parliament over Brexit, which was resolved by temporarily disapplying the act to hold an election. The Conservative government plans to repeal the law, although it has not yet put forward a replacement mechanism. The boundaries for individual constituencies for the House of Commons are also likely to be changed before the next election-the current boundaries have been in place since 2010, and the government plans to update them in advance of the next election. Given changes in population, demographers estimate that a boundary review would lead to a modest increase in seats for the Conservatives based on 2019 election results.
Political outlook: Election watch Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA), the next general election is scheduled for May 2nd 2024. The government has introduced a bill to repeal the FTPA. However, even if this is passed, a general election must be called within five years of the preceding one; they are usually held in May, to coincide with local elections.
During the course of the pandemic, the Conservative Party's lead in opinion polls over the opposition Labour Party dropped from more than 20 percentage points at the outbreak of the crisis to a near-tie after several scandals and rapid policy reversals reduced faith in the government. Since the success of the vaccine programme, the Conservatives' polling position has improved to 6-10 points ahead of Labour, which may persist if the government is seen to manage the recovery well. Local elections on May 6th saw the Conservative Party make gains on local councils, consistent with this level of national polling lead.
Political outlook: International relations The EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) was reached on December 24th 2020. The TCA is a free-trade agreement that succeeds the UK's membership of the EU single market and customs union, following its exit from EU institutions on January 1st 2021. The TCA provides for zero-tariff, zero-quota trade between the UK and EU, at least in the first instance. However, leaving the single market and customs union has created a variety of non-tariff trade barriers in the forms of border checks and product certifications. The agreement also provides a mechanism whereby if the divergence in regulations on labour, the environment or state aid becomes sufficiently great, the other side can implement retaliatory tariffs to compensate, subject to an arbitration period. The regulatory and tariff regimes may therefore drift apart over time. The TCA also leaves several areas unsettled. Negotiations between the UK and EU are ongoing over the UK receiving designations of equivalence on financial services, allowing for greater access to the EU market; and a draft finding of "adequacy" on the UK's data standards, which would allow the free flow of data. The UK has applied to re-join the Lugano convention, which allows legal judgements to be enforced across borders, but this is also opposed by several EU member states.
The UK government has stated its intention to be outward looking, pursuing a "Global Britain" strategy, and unveiled an updated defence and security policy in March 2021 outlining a strategy of greater engagement in Asia, in addition to continued engagement in the Atlantic. The UK holds the presidency of the G7 group of nations in 2021 and will host the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow in November. It intends to use these platforms to take an enhanced role in global climate change policy. On trade, the UK has achieved continuity agreements with most countries that had agreements with the EU, is seeking an agreement with the US and has applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a trade bloc of 11 Pacific nations.

The UK's score in The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings rises slightly, from 7.7 in the historical period (2016-20) to 7.8 in the forecast period (2021-25). The country's global ranking remains unchanged as the 17th most attractive business location, while at a regional level the UK climbs one place to tenth among its 18 peers.
The strongest improvements in the business environment in 2021-25 are in market opportunities and the macroeconomic environment, reflecting the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic after a historic recession in 2020. New economic frictions caused by Brexit are reflected in lower scores for foreign trade and exchange controls and the labour market.
Traditional UK strengths will remain attractive to firms, but are weakening The UK's traditional strengths as a business location have been relatively flexible labour and product markets; a pro-business policy orientation; a low burden of regulation; a welcoming attitude to foreign investment; and a stable institutional framework. Over the past five years, the UK has also made steady improvements to its digital infrastructure and to the resilience of its financial sector. Compared with many countries, these aspects of the business environment should remain attractive to firms in 2021-25, but as a result of Brexit, we expect a deterioration in some areas. The tax burden on income and business will rise over the forecast period as the government seeks to stabilise the public debt accrued during the pandemic. As in the rest of the world, national security concerns around foreign investment are hardening; the burden of regulation is likely to rise; the geopolitical environment appears less stable than in recent decades; and the creation of new trade barriers and a more restrictive immigration policy towards EU nationals limit the upside potential for foreign investors. Persistent structural weaknesses of the business environment, weak productivity and a deficit in intermediate skills are likely to persist, despite attempts at policy intermediation.

Economic activity will rebound as uncertainty recedes The UK suffered one of the largest contractions in real GDP among European economies as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, despite a sizeable fiscal response. The years 2021-22 will be characterised by a strong recovery in private consumption as lockdown restrictions are lifted and fixed investment spikes, driven by government incentives and the end of Brexit uncertainty. Strong headline GDP figures will reflect catch-up growth rather than a step change in economic trends. From 2023 government support will be largely withdrawn and taxes will rise, and we expect growth to return closer to pre-pandemic rates with the additional friction of the UK's exit from the EU single market, with increased public investment largely balanced out by higher tax burdens.
The UK features flexible product and labour markets relative to its peers, a high employment rate and a more resilient banking sector than a decade ago. The UK's ability to borrow in its own currency offers policymakers more fiscal scope than many of their euro zone counterparts. The average maturity of UK government debt is the longest in the OECD by a considerable margin, which reduces refinancing risks. Room for manoeuvre will nevertheless be constrained in part by an already elevated stock of public debt (forecast to stabilise at around 107% of GDP by 2025) and a sizeable external deficit. Other structural limitations such as a low investment rate and poor productivity, significant skills gaps, high regional inequalities, and a reliance on consumer-facing services to drive growth, viewed alongside the erection of new trade barriers by Brexit, point to comparatively weakened medium-term growth potential.

The UK has long provided one of the world's most favourable environments for private enterprise, having pioneered the liberalisation of product markets and privatisation of state assets in the 1980s and 1990s. Levels of regulation across most services sectors are lower than the OECD average. The number of procedures, time taken and costs involved to start a new business are below the OECD average, and administrative processes involved in the payment of taxes, obtaining credit and utilities, resolving insolvency and the protection of minority investors are modest. Competition policy has been strengthened by reforms and stands up to comparison with other high-income countries. With the exception of the National Health Service (NHS), state ownership in major sectors of the economy has been fairly limited, with the government holding a majority stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS)-one of the "big four" commercial banks-retaining a presence in the nuclear and rail industries, and having become steadily more involved in the UK's housing market since the 2008 financial crisis. As in most west European countries, the level of state intervention increased sharply in response to the pandemic and is likely to remain elevated in the forecast period, even after the most acute support is withdrawn.
The Conservative government will pursue a more activist policy agenda
- Prior to the pandemic, the government had already signalled its intention to adopt a more activist, state-led policy agenda than previous Conservative administrations in areas such as infrastructure and innovation. This was extended to many other areas of the economy as a result of the crisis. Fiscal support included paying millions of workers' wages, backstopping billions of pounds of business loans and providing targeted aid to badly hit sectors such as rail and bus transport, air travel, hospitality, arts and education. Most measures were designed to be temporary, but the scale of damage from the pandemic, its scarring effects on the labour market and specific sectors, and the impact of Brexit-related disruption imply that state intervention will remain a more prominent feature of the business environment in the coming years.
- From an overall perspective, the policy environment for private enterprise should remain broadly favourable, with low levels of regulation in product and labour markets compared with many countries. However, the UK's exit from the single market and customs union has increased the administrative burden faced by all UK-based companies that engage in cross-border UK-EU trade or are integrated in global supply chains (which mostly flow through the EU).

Brexit and global tensions will make the UK a less attractive destination for FDI The UK has traditionally offered one of the world's most liberal environments for foreign investors. Since the 1980s successive governments have been favourably disposed towards inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), with the UK's deep capital markets, liberalised product markets, modest regulatory burden and well-established institutional and legal framework. Aside from some restrictions in areas related to national security and media plurality, there are comparatively few limitations on foreign control. Once established in the UK, foreign firms are treated on an equal footing with domestic companies, including access to state-backed incentives. In many respects, official policies will remain supportive of attracting FDI over the forecast period, with new incentives likely to be rolled out in targeted sectors. However, amid the global shift towards protectionism in recent years, sentiment in the UK towards inward investment in "strategic" areas of the economy has hardened. In line with trends elsewhere, the government is adopting a more interventionist stance on foreign takeovers and tightening its screening regime for FDI.

- FDI activity has remained largely concentrated around London and south-east England, mainly in the areas of information technology, real estate, finance and knowledge-based professional services. While most sectors have seen reduced inflows since 2017, there has been a marked slowdown in many of the UK's largest manufacturing industries, including automotive, aerospace and pharma-ceuticals. There is substantial existing foreign ownership in these industries (which are more geographically dispersed across the UK) and many companies deferred new investments owing to Brexit-related uncertainty. Given the increase in post-Brexit trade barriers and the additional disruption caused by the pandemic, there is a significant risk that a number of high-profile foreign-owned companies will pursue more limited investment in the UK.

UK will remain open to investment but with more national security scrutiny
- In November 2020 the government published a National Security and Investment Bill (NSIB) that increases its powers to intervene in foreign investment transactions on national security grounds. The NSIB requires foreign investors to notify the UK government about prospective acquisitions of UK companies and intellectual property in 17 "sensitive" industries, including artificial intelligence, civil nuclear, computing hardware, data infrastructure, defence, energy and transport. The government expects the burden on businesses to be minor, but in April 2021 mooted increasing the foreign ownership threshold at which investors are required to notify the government from 15% to 25% and narrowing the definitions of the 17 sensitive industries to avoid deterring foreign investors.
- The government is paying increased attention to the involvement of state-backed foreign actors (such as Chinese firms and Middle East sovereign wealth funds) in strategic infrastructure assets. Similarly to the EU, the US and Australia, in July 2020 the UK banned Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications group, as a supplier for the UK's fifth-generation (5G) mobile network. However, in November 2020 the prime minister's office created a new Office for Investment to attract foreign investment in strategic infrastructure projects. The Office announced its first successful deal in March 2021, consisting of a large investment partnership between the UK government and Mubadala, an Abu Dhabi sovereign fund, in the life sciences, technology, green energy and infrastructure sectors. This suggests that the UK's increased focus on national security will not necessarily deter state-backed foreign investors.

The UK will face significant trade barriers with the EU as result of Brexit The UK's foreign trade regime in recent decades had been strongly defined by its membership of the EU; the country's exit from the bloc (by far its largest trading partner) therefore implies a major overhaul in the forecast period. There will be a marked deterioration in trading relations with the EU, and disruption to supply chains of UK-based exporters. The EU and UK agreed a Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) in December 2020, which succeeds the UK's membership of the EU single market and customs union, which it left on January 1st 2021. The TCA primarily addresses issues around trade in goods, providing zero-tariff, zero-quota trade. However, it creates a variety of non-tariff trade barriers in the forms of border checks and product certifications. Although the TCA represents an increase in trade barriers between the EU and UK, it provides greater certainty for business and puts in place a framework for the relationship between the two parties. Talks on several important areas, including data, border controls and financial services, are continuing, but progress in expanding the TCA will be slow. There is a significant risk that the EU and UK regulatory and tariff regimes will drift apart over time.

- To minimise further disruption, the UK and the EU agreed to waive some declaration requirements around rules of origin for the first year of operation. Despite this, goods travelling between the UK and the EU face significant non-tariff barriers. For example, manufactured goods for sale in the UK and EU market have to be certified separately by product regulators in each jurisdiction. Further liberalisation in this area is possible over the forecast period, given the cost to businesses and the limited benefits to divergence in many industries, especially those sectors where the UK is integrated into EU supply chains.
- The end of the Brexit transition period has particularly increased trade frictions in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland protocol created distinctions between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK market, with Northern Ireland remaining in the EU's single market for goods, and EU customs rules being enforced at Northern Irish ports-creating a customs border in the Irish Sea. This has resulted in customs declarations and enhanced inspection facilities at Northern Irish ports, while additional sanitary and phytosanitary checks are conducted on some products entering from Great Britain. In early 2021 many customs declarations were waived as part of a grace period outlined in the UK's withdrawal agreement. The ending of the grace period will create greater disruption once the protocol is fully applied. The UK announced a unilateral extension of the grace period to October 1st 2021, in response to which the EU threated legal action. The dispute over the implementation of the protocol suggests that UK-EU tensions will persist over the forecast period, limiting the scope for addressing other challenges over the implementation of the TCA.
- Amid a fraying multilateral trade system; rising protectionist sentiment globally; deepening frictions in US-China, US-EU and Europe-China relations; and a once-in-a-generation negative shock to the world economy from the pandemic, the UK's attempt to develop an independent trade policy faces heightened risks. All official and independent analyses indicate that the economic damage from erecting new trade barriers with the EU will significantly outweigh any potential net gains from new free-trade agreements (FTAs) with non-EU countries. The UK has agreed FTAs with Canada, Japan and South Korea, largely continuing the pre-Brexit status quo with minor adjustments. However, new trade agreements with major economies such as the US, India and China will probably require concessions from the UK on market access and possibly on foreign policy issues.

The tax burden will rise over the forecast period We expect the tax regime to become less competitive in 2021-25 owing to a larger and more complex tax burden. We expect the government to need to raise taxes further than it has already announced, given its spending and investment commitments, and overall growth projections. The overall tax/GDP ratio has remained fairly stable over the past decade and at 33% in 2019 was slightly below the OECD average of 33.8%; taxation of labour income is competitive; and the headline corporation tax rate is currently comparatively low at 19% (down from 28% in 2010). However, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that by 2025 higher UK corporation tax rates will push the corporation tax revenue/GDP ratio above the OECD average. Marginal tax rates on corporate investment are high (owing to elevated business property taxes and a limited capital allowance regime) and the steady trend in the overall tax take has masked significant structural changes in the composition of revenue. Payment of some indirect taxes for businesses trading with the EU, such as value-added tax (VAT) and customs and excise duties, has become more onerous and complex following Brexit. The tax regime also suffers from an outdated system of residential property taxation, widespread tax avoidance among the wealthy and structures that can encourage aggressive tax-planning practices by multi-nationals.
But there will be tax relief in the near term
- The government provided temporary tax relief for companies and the self-employed in response to the pandemic. It cut the VAT rate from 20% to 5% for businesses in leisure and hospitality until September 2021, which will be followed by an interim rate of 12.5% for six months. It provided business rate holidays until June 2021, to be followed by a two-thirds-reduced rate for the rest of the financial year (April-June). It also cut stamp duty on house purchases until June 2021, with more modest relief until September 2021. To stimulate private investment, the government has introduced a two-year "super-deduction" allowing companies to write off up to 130% of the value of their plant and machinery investment on their taxable profits from 2021-23.
- From 2023 there will be a rise in the tax burden, to address the major deterioration in the public finances from the pandemic. The immediate tax rises are stealthy in nature, via "fiscal drag": the income-tax personal allowance, capital gains tax exemptions and other tax thresholds have been frozen to 2026. More noticeable is a planned rise in the corporation tax rate from 19% to 25% in 2023. This higher rate will apply to company profits over £250,000 (US$350,000), with rates tapering down to profits of £50,000, below which the rate will remain at 19%. This is the first corporation tax increase since 1974, and the UK will remain below the current average corporate tax rate of 27% in the G7 group of nations, but given the UK's broad corporate tax base, the effective tax rate will be higher. Given the March 2021 budget's optimistic productivity and spending assump-tions, we expect further tax increases over the forecast period. These could include changes in less high-profile areas such as self-employment contributions, inheritance and capital gains tax, and environmental levies. However, broader (and more unpopular) tax rises could be implemented if the government seeks, or is pressured, to adopt a faster pace of deficit reduction.
- The UK has a competitive regime for taxation of labour income, with one of the lowest tax wedges in the OECD. The tax burden on households has risen over the past decade, largely in response to various "stealth" taxes (such as on travel and insurance). The standard VAT rate is 20%-slightly higher than the OECD average. Excise duties on fuel, tobacco and alcohol are among the highest in Europe. Crossborder VAT rule changes coincided with the UK's exit from the EU single market at end-2020. All foreign businesses selling to UK customers are now required to register for VAT, collect and pay the tax, causing particular confusion for EU businesses accustomed to charging their domestic VAT rates. Additional complexity results from the £135 threshold at which VAT on imported goods is paid on delivery rather than at point of sale.

Withdrawal of coronavirus support could affect quality of financial assets Since the 2008 financial crisis, the underlying resilience of the banking sector has improved. On aggregate the Tier 1 capital ratio of the banking sector rose during the pandemic, and was around three times higher than in 2008. Major banks have substantially reduced their reliance on wholesale funding and the non-performing loan ratio is among the lowest in Europe. Annual bank stress tests by the Bank of England (BoE, the central bank) have implied that the sector could withstand a major negative shock. Overall housing debt in the UK is high, but subdued mortgage growth and stabilising house prices in the years preceding the pandemic mitigated near-term risks. House price growth and mortgage activity accelerated in 2020, but the risk of a sharp correction appears low. Recent Financial Stability Reports by the BoE have judged that the financial system is generally resilient, but highlight the risk of rising unemployment and business insolvencies as policy support is withdrawn.

- Brexit will continue to create uncertainty for the financial services sector, given London's deeply integrated role in EU and global financial markets. The UK will remain a leading financial centre, especially in foreign exchange and derivatives, but a loss of influence and greater restrictions on financial services trade with the EU are inevitable, due to the loss of "passporting" (the right for EU- and European Economic Area-based financial companies to conduct business throughout the EU). A future regime is likely to be based on a so-called enhanced equivalence framework, a less stable arrangement than passporting. This is granted unilaterally by EU regulators by sector, and can also be unilaterally revoked. It applies to far fewer transactions, and still represents a significant increase in friction compared with passporting. The UK's process of applying for equivalence in most areas of financial services remains at an early stage.
- The economic fallout from the coronavirus crisis will test the resilience of major banks' balance sheets. Extensive government-backed loan-guarantee schemes, liquidity support, short-term grants and job-retention measures helped to mitigate the near-term damage to private-sector balance sheets from the coronavirus-related slump and bolstered access to financing for businesses. However, significant take-up of "rescue" loans by companies, particularly smaller firms, raises the prospect of a rise in defaults if demand remains weak.
- The pandemic accelerated the growth of online banking and payments services-already well established in the UK-providing opportunities for innovative lenders and financial technology (fintech) companies to compete with the large banking institutions. Growth in non-bank financing will be supported by London's status as the main European hub for private equity and venture-capital investment. Green finance may also experience fast growth, although the number of projects available to finance in the UK lags other north European countries, where the governments have been more proactive in pushing green projects and sovereign green bonds.

High employment rate, but weak trends in wages and productivity will persist The labour market is among the most flexible in the world, with a decentralised system of wage bargaining and fairly liberal laws on redundancy. Coupled with a favourable environment for new business creation, this supported a robust expansion in employment and a steady decline in joblessness in the 2010s. The pandemic partly undid this progress, but government support has limited the damage to the labour market. However, positive headline data disguised weaker aspects of the labour market including depressed earnings growth; comparatively low levels of technical skills and vocational training; and an increased share of less secure employment (agency jobs and temporary or "zero hour" contracts), mostly in low-wage, low-skill occupations that point to a developing two-tier "insider-outsider" labour market. The UK's productivity performance since 2008 has been poor, with growth in output per hour and output per worker considerably weaker than its long-term pre-crisis trend, and than almost all peer economies.

- Relative to the scale of economic disruption from the pandemic, we expect a modest increase in the unemployment rate, peaking at 5.5% in 2021, from a low of 3.8% in 2019. Damage to the labour market has been mitigated by a huge state-backed job-retention scheme, which at its peak in April 2020 subsidised the wages of 9.1m furloughed employees (almost 30% of the working population). It covered just below 4m employees as of early 2021. The scheme is to be phased out by September 2021, although support could be extended if additional restrictions are imposed in the third quarter. We expect unemployment to fall from 2022, as hiring recovers. With online job vacancies already above pre-pandemic levels in April 2021, certain sectors are likely experience recruitment difficulties over the forecast period, particularly in migrant-dependent sectors.

There could be labour shortages in low-skilled sectors
- Net inflows of EU labour have fallen steadily since the Brexit referendum, but this has been largely offset by increased net inflows from outside the EU. During the pandemic, there appears to have been a sizeable net outflow of expatriates, although estimates vary widely. A new immigration policy took effect from January 2021. Under the new policy, EU and non-EU citizens wishing to work in the UK will be assigned points for specific skills, qualifications, salaries and occupations, according to certain thresholds. Work visas are then awarded based on those points. With the exception of a seasonal programme for agricultural workers, the system is explicitly designed to reduce lower-skilled immigration. It has drawn criticism from business groups and the healthcare sector, which have raised concerns over staff recruitment, with the risk of acute labour shortages in sectors such as social care, transport, food manufacturing and construction. If such shortages emerged, we expect that the government would expand its list of shortage occupations and seasonal working schemes.
- Starting end-January 2021 the government eased the path to residency and citizenship for 3m Hong Kong residents who hold British National Overseas (BNO) status. In the first quarter of 2021, 27,000 people applied for BNO visas. The government expects to issue about 300,000 BNO visas by 2025, partly offsetting the decline in EU migration over the forecast period.

The quality of network infrastructure is modest by developed-country standards. The government has pledged stronger public infrastructure investment over the forecast period, but uncertain prospects for private-sector financing, weakened public finances and legacy effects from decades of underinvestment will limit improvements. The main shortcomings are severely congested road and urban rail networks (before the pandemic), inadequate plans for new energy-generation capacity and a housing market suffering from issues of affordability and undersupply. Airport capacity has also long been viewed as a weakness, although near-term demand effects from the pandemic mitigate this. In contrast, the UK is among the better-performing countries in the region in terms of digital connectivity, with mobile network penetration and take-up of broadband services above the regional average. The UK lags in full-fibre broadband coverage, but steady improvements are expected in 2021-25. Utility markets are reasonably competitive, but energy costs are slightly above the regional average.
There will be modest efforts to address a legacy of infrastructure underinvestment
- The UK has long suffered from a short-termist approach to infrastructure by successive governments. In 2016 a new National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) was tasked with planning infrastructure priorities over a 30-year horizon. In late 2018 the NIC identified around £600bn of prospective investment projects in the decade to 2030. The government published a formal National Infrastructure Strategy in November 2020, focusing on "levelling up" regional disparities and meeting the UK's net zero emissions target by 2050. The government plans to launch a UK Infrastructure Bank based in Leeds in 2021. The bank will have £12bn in capital and £10bn in guarantees to support private-sector and local government projects in line with this new strategy. We expect a step-up in public infrastructure spending on renewable energy, transport, housing and digital projects, albeit from a modest level, given modifications to the value for money formula to create more regional balance. We also expect the government to increase the level of borrowing for investment from 2% of GDP to 3%. However, overall progress is likely to continue to be hampered by restrictive planning regulations, high land prices, vested interests and funding uncertainty.
- Usage of passenger rail services almost doubled in the two decades to 2020, placing huge pressure on the network. When rail travel collapsed during the pandemic, the government renationalised rail franchises and provided bailouts to public transport operators. The future viability of existing rail and public transport infrastructure and the duration and extent of government support will depend on long-term commuting and travel habits following a normalisation of homeworking during the pandemic. Two new major rail projects are still progressing, but both face significant delays and overruns. An 118-km east-west rail link under central London (Crossrail) is scheduled to begin services in the first half of 2022. A high-speed rail network (HS2) from London to major northern cities was approved in 2017, despite widespread local opposition and spiralling costs. The first-phase from London to Birmingham is due for completion only by 2030.

The UK scores reasonably well on a regional and global basis, owing to its digital infrastructure; extensive e-commerce and e-business penetration; above-average digital skills levels; and a well-developed framework of research and innovation infrastructure, arising in part from the country's highly regarded scientific and university base. Weaker aspects are comparatively low levels of public and private research and development (R&D) spending, modest linkages between the research and business sectors, and fairly limited scope of e-government services. R&D intensity has remained broadly flat at around 1.7% of GDP, below a recent EU average of 2.1%. The government seeks to increase R&D spending to 2.4% of GDP by 2027, an ambitious target given the challenging fiscal outlook. There is significant regional disparity in R&D spend across the UK, and studies indicate that the share of UK companies using industrial robotics or deploying emerging digital technologies is among the lowest in the OECD. The UK has a comparatively robust cyber-security framework, with a National Cyber-Security Centre (NCSC) established in 2016. There are concerns that Brexit will lead to a weakening of cyber-security collaboration with the EU.
The UK's science and university base will remain a critical strength
- The UK will retain a strong scientific and university base. The government has pledged an increase in public R&D investment and a greater focus on support measures for "higher-risk" start-ups and research in areas such as fintech and life sciences (where the UK is a leading global player). In March 2020 the government announced plans to establish an £800bn "blue skies" research fund, modelled on the US Advanced Projects Research Agency. However, a February 2021 House of Commons report criticised the undefined purpose of the agency.
- The government's 70% cut in official development assistance in 2020-21 has resulted in a £120m funding gap for existing joint overseas research projects, according to UK Research and Innovation. The UK government allocated £650m in 2021 to remain part of the Horizon 2020 EU science programme after Brexit, but it is unclear how the full £1bn-2bn will affect domestic research funding. These disruptions and uncertainties around research funding, will result in gradual weakening of research and innovation activity over the forecast period.
- Since mid-2019 all four main mobile network operators in the UK have launched commercially available 5G services in limited areas. The timetable for a national rollout is uncertain, however, with the government deciding to strip Huawei equipment from the 5G network by 2027. Alternative suppliers to Huawei include Ericsson (Sweden) and Nokia (Finland). The government estimates that the change in stance will delay the UK's 5G rollout programme by two to three years, at a cost of up to £2bn.

Economic forecast: Policy trends Even before the pandemic, the UK faced significant economic policy challenges, including low public investment, wide regional disparities, high housing costs and chronically low productivity growth. However, the scale of the disruption caused by the virus is likely to dominate the government's policy agenda well into 2021. We do not expect UK GDP to return to its pre-crisis level before late 2022.
Since becoming the Conservative Party leader and prime minister, Mr Johnson has advocated greater public-sector investment, including in infrastructure, and additional current spending on the National Health Service, education and the police. The government has also reformed the UK's immigration system to emphasise skilled labour. Long-term social care is an area of health spending that Mr Johnson's manifesto pledged to address, alongside significant investment in green and renewable energy as part of a green recovery plan, although details for both remain vague. The government is also attempting to encourage public and private investment to address the UK's chronic low productivity, most prominently in a two-year tax "super-deduction" allowing companies to write off tax up to 130% the value of their capital investment from 2021-23, as well as expanding the scope of public borrowing for investment from 2% of GDP to 3%.
Economic forecast: Fiscal policy Fiscal indicators

Government expenditure 50.8 49.0 43.9 43.9 44.5 44.5
Government revenue 35.9 36.9 37.1 40.6 41.9 41.8
Budget balance -14.9 -12.1 -6.8 -3.4 -2.6 -2.7
Government debt 104.5 110.7 108.7 108.6 107.9 107.1
At the outbreak of the pandemic, the government enforced nationwide shutdowns and developed a series of financial support packages to aid workers and businesses affected by the coronavirus. These included government-backstopped loans; several business tax deferments and holidays; targeted aid to the worst-affected sectors, such as travel and retail; and wage support schemes for salaried and self-employed workers. In the government's March 2021 budget, the government committed to extending most pandemic support measures into the autumn of 2021, only completely phasing them out by March 2022. We expect that this will lead to a fiscal deficit of 12.1% of GDP in 2021, with the debt/GDP ratio peaking at about 111% this year.
The government's most recent budget has committed to greater fiscal consolidation, with a planned increase in corporation tax from 19% to 25% in 2023. However, this budget assumes highly ambitious increases in productivity growth and minimal increases in health, education and welfare spending from pre-pandemic levels after 2022. This is likely to be resisted within the Conservative Party, particularly given the government's campaign promises of greater spending and investment. As a result, we expect that further tax increases are likely between now and the end of the forecast period, with debt declining only marginally, to 107% of GDP, and stabilising at that level in 2022-25.

On March 19th 2020 the Bank of England (BoE, the central bank) cut its main rate to 0.1%-its lowest ever level. It also resumed its quantitative easing programme, committing to £450bn (US$620bn) in asset purchases, which was expanded twice more in 2020, reaching a total of £895bn. From April 2020 until the end of that year the BoE allowed the government access to its overdraft account, the so-called Ways and Means facility, to directly finance day-to-day costs, although this facility was not tapped. The BoE has signalled that negative interest rates would not be technically possible to implement before August 2021, at which point the economy is likely to be recovering sufficiently to not need further cuts. Given the length of the pandemic and the associated downturn, we do not expect the BoE to raise rates before mid-2022.

The coronavirus pandemic and ensuing public health measures caused a severe economic contraction in 2020, with real GDP shrinking by 9.9%. The most recent lockdown is likely to have resulted in a contraction in growth in the first quarter of 2021. A significant bounce-back is likely from the second quarter as restrictions are lifted and government incentives for increased investment kick in, and we forecast growth of 5.3% in 2021 as a whole. We forecast further catch-up growth of 5.6% in 2022, which will probably be the first full year without social distancing restrictions. However, most of this headline growth will stem from favourable year-on-year comparisons with the 2020-21 lockdowns as shut-down activities restart, rather than from robust new economic activity. We expect the level of real GDP to exceed its 2019 peak only in late 2022. In 2023-25 we expect growth to slow as taxes rise and catch-up growth abates, averaging 1.7% per year.
After reaching a low of 3.8% in 2019, unemployment rose in 2020 as the pandemic led to business failures and lay-offs. The spike in unemployment was modest, however, at an estimated average rate of 4.5% in 2020, owing to the government's furlough scheme. We expect the rate to average 5.6% in 2021 as the scheme is withdrawn. Employment will rise gradually and unemployment will begin to fall from 2022, reaching 4% by the end of our forecast period in 2025.
Gross capital formation declined sharply in 2020 as the highly uncertain global business environment depressed investment. We expect a significant bounce-back in investment growth in 2021 and 2022, driven in part by the government's investment tax super-deduction, as well as by a more stable post-pandemic and post-Brexit investment environment. Investment growth should stabilise from 2023 until the end of the forecast period.
Export and import growth turned sharply negative in 2020 as global demand collapsed and coronavirus-related travel restrictions persisted. We expect growth to bounce back in 2021 and 2022, but expect Brexit-related disruption to restrict the pace of growth.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends The aftermath of the pandemic and Brexit have the potential to significantly change the sectoral profile of the economy. In 2019 services accounted for 80% of GDP-a comparatively high share among advanced economies-with industry contributing 14%, construction about 6% and agriculture less than 1%. These shares have remained broadly stable in the past decade: prior to that, the share of services had increased steadily, mainly at the expense of industry. This trend was upended globally during the pandemic, with consumption and trade of goods being more robust and quicker to bounce back from initial lockdown restrictions than services. This was particularly the case in the UK where the hospitality sector was estimated at 17% of services gross value added, and was most severely affected by lockdown restrictions.
In addition to hospitality (defined as distribution, hotels and restaurants), business services and finance account for an additional 40% of services value added, followed by government and public administration with 28%, with the remainder comprising transport, storage and communications. Business services, communications, and wholesale and retail trade have been the main growth drivers in recent years, and remained relatively robust during the pandemic, although Brexit restrictions on professional services qualifications may reduce their competitiveness in the European market. In contrast, growth in value added in healthcare, education and public administration has been inhibited by government austerity measures, and the decade since the global financial crisis has been a challenging one for the financial services sector, amid widespread cost-cutting and restructuring.
The future of the financial services sector is unclear One sector facing considerable uncertainty is financial services, which accounts for about 6% of GDP and makes a significant contribution to tax revenue. London is one of the two leading global financial centres (with New York) and has the largest share of many international markets. In the event of Brexit, we expect London to retain its position as Europe's leading centre for financial services activity. Many factors that have made the UK a world leader in financial services are not contingent on its membership of the EU, such as its supportive infrastructure in terms of law, culture, language, tax system, sectoral expertise and the regulatory environment. Nevertheless, a loss of influence and post-Brexit restrictions on UK-EU financial services trade will be inevitable. Greater access to the EU market, through a designation of "equivalence" by European regulators may provide more streamlined access, but this process will take some time to negotiate and would still make for significant frictions compared with single-market access. Activities requiring an EU presence have moved out of London, with Amsterdam now becoming the largest centre for stock trading in Europe, but the mobile nature of the sector will limit the impact on jobs.
Governments have attempted to increase the housing supply The construction sector currently accounts for about 6% of GDP. After a brief decline amid the 2008 financial crisis, the 2010s saw a period of fairly robust house price growth accompanied by limited house-building activity. The stringency of planning regulations and vested interests in supporting house price inflation have consistently held back the construction of new homes over recent decades, especially in and around London. A range of policy initiatives have been implemented over the past few years with the stated aim of boosting the housing supply, including revisions to the planning system, relaxation of local authority borrowing rules for housing, and an expanded housing infrastructure fund. However, their relative impact has been modest, with other government measures, such as "help to buy" funding support, continuing to underpin house price growth. Modest growth in house-building has been the main driver of total construction output in recent years, amid an otherwise subdued sector, exacerbated since 2018 by the collapse of Carillion and Interserve, two of the UK's largest construction and outsourcing companies.
The housing market has experienced significant fluctuations during the pandemic, with a one-year holiday on stamp duty leading to an overall increase in house prices, and substantial regional swings, as buyers search for more space away from city centres. The phase-out of the stamp duty holiday, scheduled to last until September 2021, along with changing consumer preferences, will lead to continued volatility in the market.
As in most other developed economies, in recent decades the manufacturing sector has accounted for a falling share of UK GDP. This partly reflects the fact that, with the exception of 2020, households spend a rising share of their income on services as their wealth increases. However, the decline in the UK in the period between 1980 and 2009 was more pronounced than in almost every other industrialised country. The deep recession of the early 1980s and government policies dealt a permanent blow to the country's industrial heartlands, but it is notable that the declining importance of manufacturing was particularly acute from the mid-1990s (when the sector still accounted for almost 27% of output in 1997) up to the global financial crisis. The persistent strength of sterling for much of this period weakened export-oriented manufacturers' competitiveness, at the same time as labour-intensive industries were unable to compete with rising imports from expanding emerging economies with lower wage costs. Industrial investment declined further from already comparatively low levels. The manufacturing sector's share of GDP has remained fairly stable since 2009, at about 10% (out of an industry total of 14%). The two largest subsectors are food and beverages, and transport equipment, which together account for about one-third of all manufacturing output. Within the transport category, motor vehicle production by mostly foreign-owned firms dominates. Brexit disruption looms large in this sector, as supply chains, particularly in the automotive sector, are highly integrated into the EU economy, and the loss of frictionless access to the EU market is likely to make UK factories less competitive. A shift towards electric vehicles will lead to further disruption in European manufacturing supply chains, with the future of a number of major vehicle manufacturing plants in the UK now potentially at risk in 2021-25.

Inflation declined sharply in 2020 as a result of depressed demand owing to the coronavirus pandemic, and we estimate average inflation of 1% in full-year 2020. We expect price pressures to pick up modestly as demand and asset prices rebound, reaching 1.5% and 2% in 2021 and 2022 respectively. From 2023 we expect inflation to decline to a more modest level as pent-up demand is exhausted, stabilising at 1.6% by 2025.

The value of sterling has been volatile in recent years owing to the degree of political uncertainty around Brexit and the pandemic, as well as the UK's large current-account deficit, which requires significant international capital investment to support the currency. Sterling strengthened against the US dollar in 2020 and early 2021 as the uncertainty around a potential no-deal Brexit ended and a flight to safety in dollar liquidity gradually unwound, with sterling peaking at US$1.41:£1 in February 2021. Sterling has similarly begun to appreciate against the euro in 2021 as Brexit uncertainty dissipates and the UK economy unlocks more rapidly.
We expect sterling to continue to appreciate against the euro, rising from EUR1.08:£1 at end-2020 to EUR1.19 by end-2021. We expect sterling to stabilise against the euro from mid-2022, averaging EUR1:22:£1 in 2022-25. We expect both currency pairs to appreciate modestly against the dollar during this period as the demand for the safe-haven currency decreases, with sterling reaching US$1.46:£1 by end-2025.

The coronavirus outbreak caused a sharp fall in global trade as demand declined, travel was disrupted and global supply chains were compromised by national lockdowns. The UK was not exempt from this, with both imports and exports declining sharply in 2020. From 2021 we expect trade to rebound, although this will primarily be the result of a recovery from the 2020 base year, and we expect Brexit to weigh on exports (as well as imports, but to a lesser extent). Most catch-up growth in trade, particularly in exports, will be likely to take place in 2022 as global markets fully unlock and UK firms become more experienced in exporting under new trading rules. The UK has run a persistent current-account deficit since 1985. We expect the deficit to widen from 3.5% of GDP in 2020 to 4.2% of GDP in 2021 as the export sector is weakened by worse terms of trade with the EU, before stabilising thereafter.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in the United Kingdom Stocks and flows Since the early 1990s the UK has been one of the top recipients of foreign direct investment (FDI) among the world's advanced economies and the biggest recipient of FDI in the EU. In 2019 the UK held the fourth-largest stock of global FDI, about half of which was from other EU countries, according to figures from the OECD. The stock of FDI in the UK totalled an estimated US$2.4trn at the end of 2019, equivalent to 83.7% of GDP. Relative to GDP, the UK's inward FDI stock is the highest in the G7 group of industrialised countries, although it is well below that of several medium-sized European economies such as Ireland, the Netherlands and Sweden.
Following the slump in global mergers and acquisitions (M&A) at the beginning of the 2000s, annual FDI inflows into the UK rose strongly in 2005-08, peaking at US$253bn. During this period the number and scale of FDI projects into the UK-mostly in the form of M&A-confirmed the country's status as one of the world's top recipients of FDI. The global financial crisis and severe economic recession resulted in a marked slowdown in inflows, as access to all forms of financing was restricted. Since 2010 the trend in FDI inflows has mostly been steady rather than spectacular, averaging an annual US$60.8bn in 2010-15. After a brief surge in 2016, largely as a result of foreign acquisitions of two large UK companies, FDI inflows gradually weakened, then fell sharply to US$2.3bn in 2019 amid Brexit uncertainty, and remained subdued at US$18.2bn in 2020 owing to the pandemic. As the economy recovers, we forecast a rebound from 2021 and especially in 2022.
Origin and distribution US companies have long been the largest inward direct investors in the UK, although taken together the EU27 account for the largest share of the total inward FDI stock. As at the end of 2019 (latest data) the US accounted for 24% of the UK inward direct investment stock. As a region the EU accounted for a cumulative 44%, with the Netherlands and Luxembourg holding the two largest shares-an indication of the significant influence of financial services activity and related changes in multinational ownership structures, often for tax purposes, on the FDI data. The share of Asian countries (primarily Japan) has been fairly stable over recent years, at 10%, similar to the proportion accounted for by UK offshore islands. Financial services, electronics and automotive have traditionally accounted for a large share of inward FDI into the UK and remain important sectors, but the composition is steadily changing, with the UK attracting greater investment in areas such as business services, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, information technology, software development and energy generation.
Determinants The UK's attractiveness as a location for FDI over the past 20 years has rested on a policy of openness to foreign investors, a relaxed attitude to foreign takeovers of domestic companies, liberalised product markets, a flexible labour market (by European standards in particular), deep and liquid capital markets, external economies of scale in sectors such as financial services (where London's position as a financial centre has developed and fed on a large pool of qualified banking, legal and other business services staff) and membership of the EU (which gave firms located in the UK access to the world's largest trading bloc). Hard data and anecdotal evidence point to weakening inward investment since the Brexit referendum, and there is a clear risk that the withdrawal of the UK from the EU will significantly undermine the country's attractiveness, to foreign investors, given reduced trading opportunities with the large EU market. Less tangible but still important magnets have been the status of English as the world's leading business language, and the preponderance of the English legal system in international transactions law.
Impact FDI has had a positive effect on the economy, even if studies suggest that this is sometimes exaggerated. Inward direct investors employ about 2m workers in the UK, and many of the country's most productive business units, such as the Nissan and Toyota car plants, are foreign-owned. Evidence for broader spillover effects is more mixed. Although foreign companies are often held to improve working practices and quality standards in local companies, empirical evidence suggests that positive spillover effects-if they occur at all-are geographically concentrated, partly because of low levels of labour mobility.
Potential In the long term the UK should continue to be a broadly attractive location for FDI, although continued uncertainty about the country's future trading relationship with the EU will deter some investors, especially from EU countries. Although we expect the UK to remain relatively relaxed about foreign ownership in domestic corporations relative to its peer countries, pressure from the US and domestically will lead to greater national security scrutiny of foreign ownership of key infrastructure, particularly with regard to Chinese companies. Some investors will also remain wary of the UK's macroeconomic imbalances (relatively weak public finances, a sizeable current-account deficit, high levels of private-sector debt and a reliance on consumer spending to drive growth), an increasingly polarised political scene and weak underlying trends in domestic investment and productivity that will weigh on the economy's medium-term growth potential. A major weakness of the UK business environment will remain the congestion and unreliability of its land transport infrastructure, with significant uncertainty regarding future projects in this area over the coming years. Nevertheless, existing clusters and economies of scale in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, financial services, biotechnology and software development will remain powerful magnets for foreign entrants.

Brexit and the pandemic will tighten the labour market The UK population totalled an estimated 67.5m in 2019, up from 63.3m in 2010 and 59m in 2000, with growth averaging 0.7% per year in 2011-19. Up until the mid-1990s the rise in the population was primarily driven by "natural change" (that is, more births than deaths). This remains a significant factor, but over the past two decades the primary driver has been net migration into the UK. According to latest official estimates, net immigration totalled 272,000 in 2019, broadly unchanged from recent years, but down slightly from record levels of net immigration in 2015, when Bulgarian and Romanian migrants were able to come to the UK for the first time. The coronavirus pandemic is believed to have led to substantial net emigration from the UK, as foreign nationals returned home to wait out the crisis as economic and public health conditions deteriorated. Population estimates during the pandemic are subject to greater than usual uncertainty and are unlikely to be reflected in official figures for some time, but estimates put the number of emigres in 2020 at between 400,000 and 1.3m (between 0.6% and 2% of the UK population). We expect these figures to be only partly reversed post-pandemic, leading to tighter labour market conditions than previously.
Even prior to the pandemic, there was a marked decline in net inflows of people from other EU countries after the Brexit vote in 2016. Net migration of EU nationals fell to 49,000 in 2019, the lowest level in a decade. This compared with a net annual inflow of over 200,000 prior to the referendum. The reduced attractiveness of the UK for EU citizens was, however, largely offset by increased arrivals from outside the bloc. In 2019 a total of 282,000 non-EU citizens came to the UK, the highest total since 2004 although this partly reflects a steady increase in recent years in the number of people coming to the UK to study (primarily in higher education), rather than to work. We expect this trend to resume from 2022, as international travel becomes possible again.
In 2021 the UK adopted a skills-based immigration system which favours high-skilled migrants, while abandoning the cap on the number of total work visas issued. We do not expect this to drastically change immigrant numbers, although the composition, in terms of countries and skills, is likely to change. This will lead to greater human capital, but may lead to labour shortages in low-skilled occupations.
In the past decade population growth has been faster in England than in the other constituent nations of the UK, lifting its share of the total to an estimated 84.4% in 2018 (compared with 8.1% for Scotland, 4.6% for Wales and 2.8% for Northern Ireland). The strongest growth has been in London-the destination of more than a third of international migrants in recent years-followed by the east and south-east regions of England. These trends have been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, but are likely to resume thereafter, providing a steady stream of labour in and around the capital, but also placing more pressure on already overstretched transport infrastructure and housing supply.
An ageing population will add to fiscal pressures in the forecast period Births are continuing to outnumber deaths. The number of live births has fluctuated in recent decades but has stabilised since the 1960s baby boom and has generally been between 700,000-800,000 since the 1970s. Births peaked recently at 813,000 in 2012, the highest since 1990. The long-term trend in the death rate has been more stable than the birth rate, and the number of deaths declined steadily until 2011, as people are living longer, but since then has begun to rise gradually, reaching 640,370 in 2019. 2020 and 2021 are likely to see a spike in deaths due to the coronavirus pandemic, with the latest estimates for excess deaths owing to the coronavirus as of May 2021 at above 127,000 since March 2020.
As in most developed economies, the UK population is ageing-albeit not quite as rapidly as in some EU countries-as the mortality rate declines (particularly among males). This implies that pension-related spending (the largest single component of UK public-sector expenditure), as well as spending on the social care sector, will continue to account for a rising share of total public spending, adding to budgetary pressure on public services, including healthcare. Since the mid-1970s the median age of the UK population (the age at which half of the population is younger and half is older) has risen from 34 years to about 40 years. The share of the population aged 65 or over is projected to continue to rise steadily, to 19.5% in 2024, up from 18.1% in 2015 The share of the working-age population peaked in 2008-09 and will continue to decline gradually in the 2021-25 forecast period.

Market opportunities available to businesses operating in the UK in the forecast period (2021-25) will evolve as the UK pursues an independent economic policy from the EU and rebounds from the coronavirus pandemic.
The departure of the UK from the EU single market and customs union will lead to increased costs for manufacturers, especially those operating complex supply chains crossing between the UK and EU. The process of phasing in new customs checks and compliance procedures over 2021 and potential tariffs thereafter will lead to increased frictions at the border, limiting UK manufacturers' competitiveness in the EU market, especially for low-margin commodities. Services exporters to the EU will also face greater trade barriers, as mutual recognition of standards and visa-free business travel between the UK and EU will no longer be guaranteed. The UK and EU are likely to normalise and streamline the process of goods and services trade, although this is unlikely to take place until the latter half of the forecast period, as the political salience of Brexit has receded from UK politics.
A pandemic-related glut in household savings will drive consumer growth Prior to the pandemic, solid growth in full-time employment, low inflation and favourable borrowing conditions had supported consumer spending, which has been fairly resilient amid the increased uncertainty over Brexit, in contrast to private investment which grew by an average of 0.7% in 2017-19. As a result, the economy has become highly dependent on increased household spending, particularly in the large hospitality and retail sectors. Household savings had declined in the wake of the Brexit referendum amid slow growth, averaging 6.3% of total income in 2017-19. The pandemic led to a glut in household savings, owing to caution by households and a lack of spending opportunities due to lockdowns, with the savings/income ratio reaching 19.7%. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects there to be a significant drawdown of this glut in 2021 and 2022, stimulating renewed consumer spending, and it will continue to provide more modest support for private consumption growth thereafter.
More active industrial policy will drive growth in new markets The government is likely to continue to provide extraordinary support in the market, even after the most acute phase of the coronavirus crisis has passed. In its budget for fiscal year 2021/22, the government extended support for businesses and households, with reduced business rates for the hospitality sector. The government also plans to pursue a more targeted industrial policy, building on its comparative advantage and increased post-pandemic demand in the life sciences sector, as well as supporting transition to green industries within the electrical, transport, industrial and construction sectors.
Notwithstanding the considerable uncertainty and trading risks posed by Brexit and coronavirus, the UK's large, rich and flexible economy will continue to provide opportunities for inward investors and global exporters. With nominal GDP of US$2.71trn (at market exchange rates) in 2020, the UK is the fifth-largest economy in the world (after the US, China, Japan and Germany). GDP per head at market exchange rates totalled US$39,938 in 2020, ranking the UK in 11th position within the former EU28, between Belgium and France. According to our forecasts, after a sharp decline in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, GDP per head at market exchange rates will return to its pre-crisis levels in 2022 and continue to expand thereafter.

Coronavirus crisis will help online sales, health spending and discount retailers The UK is a mature consumer market. As in many countries, the profile of bricks-and-mortar retail is changing rapidly as a result of online shopping. The UK was one of the world's leading countries for online spend per head even prior to the pandemic, a trend which has since accelerated, with "non-store" retail up by 62% on its year-earlier level in March 2021. We expect many of these gains to persist. Consumers will retain a strong price focus for staple items such as food and clothing, sustaining the increasing market share of discounters. Demographic trends will also shape the consumer market. The UK's population is ageing, albeit less rapidly than other European countries. This will support demand for age-related services, particularly in the healthcare and tourism sectors. Income inequalities across the UK are higher than the regional average, a trend that is likely to persist in the forecast period.

Initial conditions: From the early 1990s up to 2019, with the exception of the 2008 crisis period, the economic performance of the UK improved relative to that of many of its regional peers, owing in part to a sharp rise in labour utilisation, with strong employment growth fuelling strong overall expansion. The pace of economic growth began to soften in 2019, and the economy contracted sharply in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects UK GDP to return to its pre-crisis level by 2022 as restrictions are lifted and pent-up consumer demand returns. The recovery will be constrained as corporates face rising debt from the coronavirus crisis and trade frictions from Brexit depress export-oriented industries.
The UK's prospects for growth in the medium term will be highly dependent on government policy formulation in response to these challenges. Both major parties have signalled a willingness to pursue a more interventionist strategy in the economy, and provide more public investment, in an effort to address the UK's regional inequality and weak productivity growth. The current govern-ment has increased its threshold for borrowing for investment from 2% of GDP to 3%, established a national infrastructure bank in addition to the pre-existing British Business Bank, and an £800bn (US$1.1bn) "blue skies" fund to support innovative research.
Despite securing the Trade and Co-operation Agreement with the EU, the UK's relationship with the EU remains unsettled. The UK is likely to diverge in some areas of regulation, particularly in technology and life sciences regulation, while non-tariff barriers put UK firms as a competitive disadvantage within the single market.
The UK faces entrenched regional and sectoral imbalances We expect economic performance to bounce back from the current recession, and reach pre-crisis real GDP levels by 2022. Between Brexit and the pandemic, this is likely to mask significant sectoral disruption, and the UK economy may need to become less reliant on consumer spending relative to investment to support growth.
The UK's structural advantages have traditionally included a comparatively low regulatory burden, a flexible labour market and a business environment that is conducive to foreign investment, which we expect to persist. On the negative side, factors that tend to constrain the UK's long-term outlook include over-reliance on wealth effects generated by the volatile financial and real estate sectors, high levels of private-sector debt and a deficit in "intermediate" labour market skills, which are skewed by significant geographical inequalities. These have contributed to the development of an unbalanced economy. Levels of productivity in the UK, in terms of output per hour worked, lag well behind those in the US, Germany and France. This weak trend is worrying and will weigh on medium- and long-term growth if not reversed, and will play an increasing role in policy debates.
Labour force participation is high, but will be depressed by the coronavirus Demographic trends: The working-age population is forecast to rise gradually over the long-term horizon, and the share of the population aged 65 or over will continue to increase. By 2050 those aged 65 and older are projected to account for 25.4% of the population (up from 18.7% in 2018). The share of the working-age population peaked at 66% in 2008-09 and is forecast to decline steadily, to 58.3% by 2050. Prior to the pandemic, the labour force participation rate was just below 80%- significantly higher than the OECD average. After declining in 2020, we expect it to gradually return to that level. We expect migration will continue to provide a key source of population and human capital growth. Most countries that operate skills-based immigration systems adjust their requirements periodically, a trend that we expect the UK to follow.
EU trade will decline, but it will remain the UK's most important trade partner External conditions: The UK is a highly trade-dependent economy, and thus its departure from the world's largest trading bloc will have implications for its long-term prospects. Despite the UK leaving the single market, the EU is likely to remain the UK's most important export destination, particularly for goods trade, given its proximity and the volume of existing trade. This is likely to be exacerbated if the pandemic leads companies globally to pursue shorter supply chains. Although the UK's departure from the EU will allow the UK to negotiate trade deals with third countries, trade experts have estimated that the total estimated value of trade deals currently in negotiation will not make up for the loss of access to the EU market. However, given the demographic, structural and political headwinds that the bloc faces, we expect the EU's long-term growth rate to remain modest.
The UK is likely to maintain its surplus in services, which is expected to grow as a percentage of total trade value over the course of our long-term forecast period, as e-commerce and trade in intangible goods become more prominent globally.
Institutions and policy trends: The UK is a long-established democracy with well-entrenched rule of law (guaranteeing security of contracts), liberalised product markets and a rigorous competition policy regime. Much of the UK's policy around competition, trade, product regulation and other areas of economic policymaking was informed by its EU membership, as was the governance of its own internal market, much of which is currently being moved to domestic equivalent authorities. It remains too early to gauge how effectively policymakers and institutions will manage these competencies on a national level, and whether any benefits can be realised from regaining direct control.
Long-term performance: Since the 2008 financial crisis the UK has suffered from chronically low productivity growth relative to its OECD peer countries, and relied heavily on moving people into work. Its labour force participation rate peaked at over 79% with unemployment at 3.8% prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. The flexibility of the UK labour market will see unemployment rapidly return to its downward trend as pandemic restrictions are lifted, but the UK's ability to increase its productivity will be the key driver of its performance in the long-term. A number of factors have been cited as possible causes for the UK's persistent productivity gap with its peers. These include the high degree of centralisation of the economy around London; the UK's relatively low share of spending on R&D; the dominance of the volatile financial services sector; and reliance on low-skilled immigration. Successive governments have tried to address the productivity issue, including the current government, which has committed to an increase in public investment to stimulate R&D, a shift in emphasis towards skilled immigration, and supporting investment outside London. Whether these plans will boost productivity remains highly uncertain. Real GDP is forecast to grow by an annual average of 2.4% in 2021-30, owing to rapid post-pandemic recovery in 2021 and 2022, but will moderate to 1.8% in 2031-50.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Climate change and sustainability Climate change policy in the UK has become dramatically more ambitious in the past two decades. The first major climate change policy in the UK, the 2008 Climate Change Act (CCA), established a legally binding target to cut UK greenhouse-gas emissions by 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. In 2019 that threshold was toughened, requiring the UK to reach a net zero target-that is, requiring all carbon emitting activities to be balanced out by activities that reduce emissions by the same amount-by 2050. The most recent carbon budget commits to a 78% cut in emissions from 1990 levels by 2035.
The CCA set out legally binding five-year "carbon budgets" as stepping stones towards the 2050 target. The first three carbon budgets, covering 2008-22, were set out in the original 2008 act, with the fourth and fifth budgets, covering 2023-27 and 2028-32, were enacted in 2011 and 2016. A sixth carbon budget announced on April 20th 2021, covers the period to 2037 and codifies the 78% emissions reduction. The CCA established the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), an independent and statutory body, to advise the government on emissions targets and report to parliament on progress in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and preparing for climate change. In its most recent assessment, the CCC said that the UK met its first two carbon budgets and is on track to meet the third, but that further reductions are needed to reach the subsequent three budgets.
For the first time, the sixth carbon budget also covered emissions from aviation and shipping, a significant omission in previous budgets. The CCC has advised that the following initiatives will be needed to reach the targets set out in the sixth carbon budget:

- completing the phase-out of coal power, and beginning the phase-out of natural gas, with all electricity to be replaced by renewables;
- significant public investment in mainstreaming low-carbon alternatives, particularly in the areas of electric vehicles and low carbon heating;
- managing gradual demand reduction for carbon-intensive activities such as meat consumption and air travel;
- investment in carbon capture and storage and reforestation of land; and
- incentives for moving industrial processes towards lower emissions, including carbon capture, which was supplemented by an industrial decarbonisation strategy released by the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy in March 2021

The UK will be hosting the COP26 Climate change conference in Glasgow, where all countries will review and expand on their previous commitments to decarbonisation. The government has unveiled a series of initiatives in advance of the conference, including a ten-point plan emphasis zero-carbon energy sources (including renewables, nuclear and hydrogen), changing transportation modes (including electric vehicles, walking and cycling, and green air and shipping), carbon capture and storage, and green finance.
Technological developments The capacity of countries to harness technological change and disruption will have a major impact on their long-term economic prospects. The UK has a relatively strong starting position in terms of the adoption and development of new technology. According to the technological readiness category of our business environment rankings, the UK is reasonably well placed in terms of its openness to innovation, digital connectedness and preparation for technological disruption.
The UK performs well on all the main variables that determine a country's capacity to benefit from technological change. The UK's strengths include its education system, employment policies, ability to attract talented innovators, a sophisticated digital infrastructure, advanced e-commerce and e-business penetration, above-average digital skills levels and a well-developed framework of research and innovation infrastructure as a result of its strong scientific and university base. According to the 2019 edition of the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI), a composite index published by the European Commission, the UK is one of the highest-performing countries in Europe. The UK ranks ahead of all EU countries but six in the most recent DESI assessment and performs well by global comparison too.
The UK has long been a magnet for foreign direct investment (FDI) into Europe, and industries at the technological frontier such as automotive, aerospace engineering, information and communication technology (ICT), biotechnology and micro-electronics have attracted much investment and international talent. Investment in London's Silicon Roundabout and other regions has helped to make the UK a leading technological hub. Inward investment has weakened since the Brexit vote, however, and there is a risk that the UK's exit from the EU will trigger a permanent reduction in FDI inflows with the UK viewed as a less attractive destination among investors.
The UK lags in other areas. The UK spends comparatively less on research and development (R&D) than its peers; it spent 1.8% of GDP on R&D in 2019, less than the OECD average of 2.5% and far behind the 4%-plus of top performers Israel and South Korea. The application of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies in UK industry also lags. The education system will also need to adapt to ensure that skills in ICT, especially in programming and operating robotic systems, are suitably widespread. Links between the science and business sectors will need to be strengthened to support future innovation. The government has announced plans to invest to increase R&D spending to 2.4% of GDP by 2027, invest in an £800m (US$1.1bn) "blue skies" fund to support basic research and provide greater support for bringing technological innovations to market. However, these initiatives are likely to take several years to yield results.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2016-20) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2021-25). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2016-20. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2021-25 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2016-20 ranges are then used to derive 2021-25 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2021-25, not to the likely situation in 2025 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2018 or 2023). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - Despite Venezuela's socioeconomic collapse and the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, to retain power throughout the 2021-25 forecast period. Mr Maduro's position will be supported primarily by his grip over a complex security apparatus and the opposition's lack of de facto power. The Maduro regime has managed internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through its strict control over the security forces. The patronage system is fuelled by myriad corruption schemes, enabled by the state's outsized influence over the economy. However, the ultimate source of resources is PDVSA, the state-owned oil firm, the exports of which account for the vast majority of Venezuela's foreign-exchange inflows. Although oil rents-and therefore resources-should pick up from their 2020 trough, they will remain limited in the coming months as a result of US sanctions, raising the risk of a fracture within the regime.

- Venezuela ranks as the least attractive location of the 82 countries covered in our rankings in the 2021-25 forecast period. The severe macroeconomic crisis is a key constraint, posing challenges for business through its impact on income and purchasing power, the migration of a large share of the population abroad and the destruction of virtually all of the country's non-oil productive capacity. Government policy deters foreign investment through complex regulations, a heavy tax burden and a weak commitment to creating a level playing field. Mr Maduro has indicated a greater acceptance of private (including foreign) invest-ment, but the country's structural problems will go unaddressed. Combined with US sanctions, the investment climate will remain extremely difficult.

- The macroeconomic environment will remain dismal. We expect a seven-year recession to come to an end in 2021 and hyperinflation to ease gradually, but in the context of the prolonged crisis, this will only repair a fraction of the damage incurred in recent years. Higher average oil prices are the main factor preventing a continued recession, but low production volumes will hinder a stronger recovery. Oversupply of local currency and weak exports will yield continued bolívar depreciation and growing use of the US dollar. The current account will shift into surplus, but foreign reserves will remain critically low.

- Amid political and economic crisis, Venezuela's population has declined in recent years owing to outmigration. Close to 6m Venezuelans are estimated to have left since 2014, resulting in population declines in the 2016-20 historical period. We forecast that mass outward migration will continue, given goods shortages and the lack of job opportunities. As many of the refugees and migrants will have been of working age, the old-age dependency ratio will rise. The ratio will remain low by developed-country standards, but population ageing will place growing pressure on the heavily indebted social security system in a context of volatile public finances.

Household consumption per head (US$) 980 1,230 1,280 1,290 1,340 1,410

- Years of economic crisis and hyperinflation have decimated the Venezuelan economy; in real terms, it is now two-thirds smaller than in 2013. Given our assumption that Mr Maduro will remain in power into the medium term, a strong economic recovery is unlikely in the next few years. Acute economic inequality will limit opportunities in the consumer market. Although Venezuela is generously endowed with natural resources, extremely challenging conditions will keep private-sector investment well below potential.

- Assuming that international oil prices are relatively supportive, we expect that Venezuela's economy will begin to recover from 2021. Nevertheless, this will not reverse the damage inflicted on the economy in recent years, and economic growth will plateau in the long term. GDP growth will average only 1.3% annually in 2021-30. In 2031-50 we forecast that Venezuela's real GDP growth will pick up to 5.9% as relative macroeconomic stability-a result of (limited) economic reforms by future governments-enables non-oil sector growth and boosts labour productivity, helping to offset deteriorating demographics. Persistent oil dependency will be difficult to undo, and a weak productive base will limit overall economic output.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013 proved unsuccessful. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his own popularity plummet, as his macroeconomic mismanagement-aggravated by wide-ranging US sanctions-has plunged the country into a state of economic collapse.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature to be in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. In August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly (ANC) granted itself control over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly. The ANC was dissolved at end-2020, after the PSUV and its allies regained control of the legislature in an election that was widely regarded as rigged.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise the crisis-ridden economy. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of PDVSA (the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country) has resulted in a sharp contraction in oil production. Attempts to address these problems through distortionary price and currency controls proved actively counter-productive and led to major shortages of both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by the sovereign and state-owned firms. The Maduro regime is now changing tack and pursuing incremental pro-market reforms, but its efforts are hindered by chronic economic instability, a lack of confidence in the legal framework and wide-ranging US sanctions.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the goods trade surplus fell to US$10.2bn in 2019 as a long-term decline in oil exports deepened. We estimate that the trade account deteriorated in 2020, shifting to a US$3.2bn deficit.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance The ruling party, originally called the Movimiento V República, has been in power since 1999 and transformed into the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) in 2006. The populist-nationalist PSUV was initially ruled by the late president, Hugo Chávez (1999-2013). Since Mr Chávez's death, the party has been led by Nicolás Maduro. Since taking office, the PSUV has wielded practically uncontested power, initially owing to Mr Chávez's immense popularity and later through electoral manipulation and systematic campaigns to disenfranchise opposition parties and exclude them from state institutions. The opposition is diverse and contested the 2015 legislative election as the Mesa de la Unidad Democrática coalition, winning a majority in the unicameral National Assembly (AN).
Political control is nominally disputed, but the PSUV retains de facto power. Following the opposition's 2015 victory, the government convened a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly (ANC)-recognised by the politicised Supreme Court as the de facto legislature-relegating the opposition. The PSUV subsequently retook control of the AN in a sham legislative election in December 2020. The opposition decried the polls as illegitimate and unilaterally extended its own mandate by a year. The leadership of the executive branch is similarly contested. Mr Maduro won re-election in May 2018 in extremely controversial circumstances, with most opposition candidates barred from running. In response, the then head of the AN, Juan Guaidó, declared that, in the absence of a "constitutionally elected" president, he would take up the mantle of caretaker president. A number of Latin American countries and the US recognise Mr Guaidó as the rightful president.

Political outlook: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the civic-military Maduro regime to remain in power throughout the 2021-25 forecast period, despite its failure to stem a long-running socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis. A number of factors underpin our forecast; particularly significant is the regime's strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces. This control, which depends on a patronage system that rewards the loyalty of high-ranking officials, will allow the regime to manage internal dissent.
Following a sham legislative election in December 2020, in which the PSUV retook control of the AN, the regime enjoys virtually unchecked control over all the levers of power. Meanwhile, the Guaidó-led opposition has been left scrambling without a clear path forward. The opposition's decision to boycott the December election has left it without a voice in any major government institution. Before losing control of the AN, the opposition moved to unilaterally extend its mandate by one year. However, with many lawmakers abstaining from the vote out of fear of reprisals from the Maduro regime, and with some key international players including the EU no longer recognising Mr Guaidó as the interim president (but rather as the main opposition leader), the opposition's attempt to extend its mandate lacks clear support and legitimacy.
In practice, the fallout from the election changes little in terms of policymaking; Mr Maduro has long used the executive's sweeping powers, as well as his influence over the highly politicised judiciary, to approve his policy agenda. However, retaking control of the AN is significant insofar as it all but erases any threat that the Guaidó-led opposition might pose to Mr Maduro.
There is, nonetheless, a high degree of risk attached to our forecast that Mr Maduro will remain in power. The uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19), diminished oil rents-resulting from severe mismanagement of the sector, and more recently from US sanctions-and persistent goods shortages all present hefty challenges to the regime's survival. In our view, there are three main paths to a change of government: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We believe that the prospect of military action by the US or Colombia is very low. Notwithstanding efforts by the US to increase multilateral engagement, a negotiated transition would also be difficult, as trust issues between the two sides are insurmountable. Bearing this in mind, we believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The regime's main weakness is the fragility of its internal finances. Its patronage system is crucial for sustaining its security apparatus and resisting social unrest. US sanctions will exacerbate the already poor macro-economic environment and limit the country's ability to draw in US dollar finance. The regime will continue to benefit from funds from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities, but a lack of hard currency could prove fatal to the patronage system, and will test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks and control over the security apparatus. The regime's liquidity problems-along with the deepening socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis-could therefore prompt putsch attempts in the near term.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Venezuela will continue to suffer in the 2021-25 forecast period from the weakest political and institutional framework in the region. Over two decades of rule by the PSUV have engendered low institutional effectiveness and high levels of corruption, largely owing to the centralisation of power within the executive branch. Questions about the credibility of the country's institutions, and a lack of accountability and transparency, will continue. For example, extensive corruption and clientelism in the provision of subsidised goods and utilities will remain a constraint on political and policy effectiveness. Similarly, PDVSA (the state-owned oil company) is an enormous source of direct and indirect profits for regime insiders and will continue to be run by army personnel, rather than by technocrats.
Drug-trafficking will remain a worrisome issue, with criminal networks well established in the country. US authorities have repeatedly accused high-ranking military and civilian government members of drug-trafficking (those accused deny the allegations). Another cause for concern is the high rate of violent crime. According to the latest internationally comparable data produced by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, the homicide rate in Venezuela was the seventh highest in the world in 2018, at 37 per 100,000 people. The socioeconomic situation has deteriorated dramatically since then, exacerbating some of the drivers of crime. However, anecdotal evidence indicates that fuel shortages and the coronavirus pandemic may have contained violent crime temporarily. Aside from homicides, there have been numerous high-profile kidnappings for ransom in urban areas, a development that has increased concerns about police corruption and mismanagement. This increase in criminality will continue unless measures are adopted to improve the competence and effectiveness of law enforcement agencies and the criminal justice system, to reduce impunity, and to boost youth employment.
In the event of a political transition (not our baseline forecast), there would be little progress in addressing these shortcomings within our forecast period, as approving numerous structural frameworks and eliminating inherent vested interests would require considerable political capital, which would probably be in short supply. A new government would be constrained on the one hand by public demands to punish corruption in the Maduro administration and on the other hand by the practical need to keep at least some of the more pragmatic PSUV regime members and bureaucrats, who have controlled public institutions for decades, onside. A political transition could exacerbate existing problems, such as violent crime, which is currently fuelled by corruption in the judiciary and law enforcement bodies. This could be aggravated by the disbanding of colectivos (armed pro-PSUV civilian groups), as they would probably continue to operate as armed gangs under a future government.
Political outlook: Election watch Venezuela held a legislative election in December 2020 to select the 277 members of the unicameral AN. The vote, which was boycotted by most opposition parties, was widely regarded as neither free nor fair. The results were therefore unsurprising; the Gran Polo Patriótico, an electoral alliance dominated by the PSUV, won an overwhelming supermajority of 256 seats in the legislature.
Next on the electoral calendar are regional elections (to elect governors and state legislative assemblies), due by end-2021, followed by local elections (to elect mayors and councillors) in 2022. However, it appears likely that local elections will be brought forward to 2021 and held simultaneously with the regional elections. In a context where the PSUV already controls more than 85% of governorships and mayoralties, the political benefits of consolidating power at the sub-national level will be modest. Consequently, we believe that the regime will endeavour to use negotiations over electoral conditions as a step towards gaining international legitimacy and some degree of sanctions relief. At present, we remain sceptical that the regime will acquiesce to conditions that would ensure a level playing field, and we consider that prospects for sanctions relief are dim.
Against this backdrop, the main question for the opposition will be whether to participate in elections, with the game rigged against it. We believe that some factions are likely to participate-even under unfair conditions-in a bid to make inroads into a political system from which they have been shut out. However, any gains will be modest and will not alter the fundamental balance of power.
Political outlook: International relations The Maduro regime's main foreign policy challenge will centre on managing its combative ties with the US. The administration led by the former US president, Donald Trump (2017-21), instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions as part of a "maximum pressure" campaign designed to undermine the regime. Although the aggressive sanctions policy did not produce its intended outcome, it did accelerate the decline of Venezuela's oil industry. Mr Maduro will look to reset ties with the US under the new president, Joe Biden, but we expect little progress. US policy towards Venezuela has bipartisan support in the US, and Mr Biden is unlikely to provide significant sanctions relief absent major political compromises and commitments to democratic reforms from the Maduro regime (which remain highly improbable). Any changes to US sanctions policy will therefore be only on humanitarian grounds, aimed at improving the lives of the poorest Venezuelans. For instance, we expect the Biden administration to reverse course on recently instated sanctions on crude-for-diesel swaps, which are mainly used by the regime to shore up diesel supplies for power generation, agricultural activity, water pumps and public transport.
Russia and China have previously extended major financial support, but this has been scaled back in recent years following non-payment of liabilities by Venezuela. Despite ongoing diplomatic support from Russia and China and preferential access to their state-developed coronavirus vaccines, neither will be willing to provide game-changing amounts of finance during 2021-25. Instead, Venezuela will continue to rely more heavily on Iran, which has become the regime's main international backer, sending its refined petroleum to alleviate the country's severe petrol shortages. Relations will remain close in the short term, although there is a risk in the medium term that the US may place pressure on Iran to stop providing support to Venezuela as part of possible US-Iranian peace talks.

The Economist Intelligence Unit's business environment rankings put Venezuela among the world's least attractive investment locations for the historical period (2016-20). The country's underlying score stagnates in the forecast period (2021-25), but as Angola (the lowest-ranked country in 2016-20) will register some moderate improvements in 2021-25, Venezuela's position slips, making it the worst place to do business among the 82 countries covered by our rankings.
The poor score reflects a combination of political conflict, a dismantling of the legal framework for investors, and a corrupt, poorly managed state-led model that hampers private enterprise and competition. Highly distortionary macroeconomic policy measures have created critical economic problems that have paralysed the investment climate, most noticeably through extreme difficulties in purchasing foreign exchange and remitting profits. Recurrent goods shortages, combined with the regime's highly expansionary fiscal and monetary policy stance, have generated hyperinflation.
The country's socioeconomic crisis has major implications for the various facets of the business environment. The government's desire to maintain political control means that, despite official rhetoric being more welcoming to private investment (both by domestic and foreign players), policy predictability will be weak and the risk of ad hoc interventionism will be high in 2021-25. US sanctions, weak respect for contract rights and the dearth of market opportunities will all limit inbound foreign capital. The labour market will continue to deteriorate as mass outmigration worsens skills shortages. Meanwhile, physical infrastructure will remain in a critical state as the cash-strapped government fails to make necessary investments in the transport network and in the water and electricity systems.
Our underlying forecasts for the business environment are based on the political assumption that the current regime, led by Nicolás Maduro, remains in place, but there is a high level of uncertainty regarding this projection. However, even if the regime were overthrown and a more market-friendly administration came to power, the extent of dislocation means that it would take several years to put the country on a firmer footing.

Business environment outlook: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Enforcement of price controls remains lax, but risk of state intervention remains high. Corruption and selective application of regulations are common and continue to undermine free competition.
2023-25: Contract rights remain weak, and red tape and ad hoc interventionism continue.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Government efforts to revive foreign investment fail owing to US sanctions and political and economic instability.
2023-25: Investment flows remain low amid ongoing economic volatility. Intellectual property protection and private property rights deteriorate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Currency controls are weakened, but access to foreign currency remains limited. US sanctions hamper trade.
2023-25: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, and de facto dollarisation advances. Domestic supply of foreign currency remains limited as oil prices decline.
Taxes 2021-22: Risks of further unrest and political instability reduce probability of central government increasing taxes. However, municipal authorities hike taxes owing to funding shortfalls.
2023-25: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2021-22: Inflation remains high and concerns surrounding economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2023-25: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2021-22: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Firms prohibited from firing workers until end-2022. Ongoing emigration of skilled labour aggravates skills shortages.
2023-25: Labour-market rigidities persist despite some increased flexibility in hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Underinvestment in water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts.
2023-25: Investors remain highly cautious about committing to long-term capital projects. Infrastructure deteriorates even further.
Technological readiness 2021-22: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment, but with little interest. Local use of cryptocurrency expands among middle- and high-income households.
2023-25: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to restrict internet and mobile coverage.

The macroeconomic environment will remain very weak Venezuela's macroeconomic environment ranks as the least attractive of all 82 countries covered in our rankings in the historical and forecast periods. The economy has contracted sharply for seven consecutive years, aggravated by three years of hyperinflation and a sizeable drop in oil production, from 2.4m barrels/day in 2015 to an average of 500,000 b/d in 2020. This reflects a combination of long-running underinvestment in PDVSA (the state oil firm), little private investment, deep-seated corruption and, since 2019, the impact of US oil sanctions and nationwide power cuts.

- The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic has placed huge strains on the sinking economy. Shrinking oil revenue has exerted significant pressure on the regime's finances, aggravating food and fuel shortages, and sustaining hyperinflation and sharp currency adjustment. The country has been disproportionately negatively hit by the pandemic because of the legacy of years of incompetent policymaking, which will also hamper the pace of recovery in 2021-25. Most countries in the region will recover from coronavirus-related losses in 2022-23, but we do not expect Venezuela to do so even by 2025. As Venezuela will remain in default on its external debt, no sources of external finance will be available to engineer a firmer domestic recovery. Although average global oil prices will be higher in 2021-25 than in 2016-20, oil export volumes will be less than half of what they were in the historical period, which will maintain pressure on the public finances and external accounts. Unless the Maduro regime is replaced by a more market-friendly government (which is not our central forecast), there is no prospect of a material improvement in macro-economic conditions in 2021-25.

Distortionary measures and price controls will remain the regime's norm The score for policy towards private enterprise and competition will remain extremely weak in 2021-25, with Venezuela ranking as the least business-friendly of the 82 countries assessed in the business environment rankings. Although Mr Maduro has hinted that he favours a shift towards privatisation of some state assets in a bid to address the ongoing economic crisis, little concrete progress is likely. Investors will be deterred by the challenging operating conditions and the regime's refusal to alter its underlying approach-characterised by bias against free markets and politicised and inefficient institutions. Price controls remain in place; they are currently less rigorously enforced than in recent years, but government policy is inconsistent and a renewed crackdown on retailers flouting the regulations is possible. Uncertainty about contract and property rights, limited access to hard currency (despite the recent relaxation of capital controls) and the cumbersome burden of govern-ment regulation will continue to restrict private businesses' freedom to compete. Given institutional decay in recent years and significant centralisation of power, improving competition policy (as well as restricting lobbying and addressing corruption) would require an overhaul of regulatory bodies and legal frameworks. This will not occur under Mr Maduro; even if his regime is replaced by a more market-friendly administration (not our baseline forecast), the process of improving competition policy would take several years.
New legislation signals a shift in policy towards private investment
- Under the former leader, Hugo Chávez (1999-2013), the government nationalised private enterprises run by both domestic and foreign investors, undermined private-property rights and violated contractual agreements, all of which severely constrained private-sector activity. There were far fewer state takeovers under Mr Maduro in the late 2010s, reflecting growing fiscal constraints. Since 2020 there has been a shift in official policy, with Mr Maduro adopting an increasingly equivocal approach to private investment. This is likely to reflect a tacit acknowledgement that productivity at nationalised firms has plummeted and that the state is hugely overstretched, lacking the resources to reverse this trend. The anti-blockade law passed in October 2020 includes provisions designed to encourage private-sector investment, including in joint operations with public companies. The legislation allows such agreements to be fast-tracked and classified without recourse to a public-bidding process, which effectively enables the regime to privatise firms under the radar, without full public disclosure. However, this legislation is unlikely to improve the attractive-ness of the Venezuelan market for private investors. The classification of information is designed to provide anonymity to foreign investors-to persuade them that they will be able to circumvent US sanctions-but these will remain a significant deterrent. Even if there were no sanctions, the dire state of the economy and distrust of the government's respect for contract rights would vastly reduce the pool of potential investors (domestic and foreign).
- Official rhetoric has been more supportive of private-sector investment in recent months. New measures mean that small businesses that begin operations in 2021 will be exempt from paying tax on earnings in that year and will benefit from a waiver on company registration fees. However, we do not expect a significant increase in the number of formal sector startups, and there is little sign that the drive towards encouraging private-sector activity will be matched with a reduction in state interference in the private sector. Sectors with access to foreign exchange (including energy and financial services) and those selling goods that are prone to shortages (including food retailers) remain particularly vulnerable. The regime has used accusations of black-market transactions and of overly aggressive increases in retail prices as pretexts for state intervention. Raids, fines and confiscations on retailers violating maximum prices are common and will continue during the forecast period.
- Price controls on a wide range of goods have been in place for most of the past 17 years. Under the 2014 Law of Fair Prices, the government established an open-ended price-control regime and created a regulatory body responsible for analysing product prices and company cost structures to determine fair prices and profit-margin levels. Price controls affect food manufacturers and retailers, with a broad range of food staples-including meat, dairy, cooking oil, flour and rice-featuring on the regime's list of price-controlled goods. Price controls also apply to domestic petrol sales and utility rates. Although controls theoretically remain in place, enforcement has lapsed recently (partly reflecting a growing government acceptance of US dollar transactions in the retail sector, which complicates management of retail prices). Weaker enforcement of price controls is positive for businesses, as many have struggled with profitability owing to soaring input costs. However, given the unpredictability of official policy, it is possible that the government may seek to tighten compliance with price controls during 2021-25 in a bid to address hyperinflation. This uncertainty will continue to undermine the business environment.

Foreign investment will remain scarce Venezuela's score and ranking for policy towards foreign investment stagnate in the forecast period. Assuming that the Maduro administration remains in power, there is little prospect of a significant improvement in the underlying approach towards foreign investment, even though investment is desperately needed to rebuild decimated domestic productive capacity. Although the 1999 constitution establishes national treatment for foreign capital, the Maduro administration has prioritised investment from firms tied to (or owned by) friendly governments. However, as funding from China has dried up, economic necessity has forced the regime to be less selective about sources of investment. On the face of it, the regime is also open to investment in a greater range of sectors, including industries that were nationalised under Mr Chávez (including oil). However, this shift in rhetoric is not being matched by policy reforms that would afford foreign investors greater security. Given extreme economic instability and US sanctions, we do not believe that Mr Maduro's aim of increasing foreign investment will result in a significant increase in inflows. As the government is in default on its external debt obligations, firms will not be able to access investment protection schemes, adding a further disincentive.

- The World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) is currently considering 16 cases lodged by firms affected by government nationalisation, most of which have dragged on for several years. This will deter foreign investment, particularly as there is little indication that the Maduro regime has the desire or the funds to make compensation payments. The ICSID has already concluded 33 cases, but the regime has only agreed payment plans on a limited number of these, and only under threat of seizures in foreign courts. However, this process has been drawn-out, with many claimants still pursuing payments from ICSID rulings made in 2015-16. In recent cases the Venezuelan government has argued that US sanctions prohibit pay-ment transfers, but a US federal court rejected that argument in March in the case of Tenaris (Luxembourg), a steel-pipe maker that is seeking enforcement of a US$234m arbitration award.
- The government has indicated that it would welcome fresh foreign invest-ment in the oil sector, as part of an overall drive to lifting production back to 1.5m b/d (2016-17 levels), from 500,000 b/d in 2020. This is an acknowledgement that PDVSA remains in a critically poor state and is in no position to revive production. Mr Maduro has indicated that he will table an oil reform bill to allow foreign firms to control majority stakes in new projects (foreign investors can currently hold a maximum 49% stake, giving PDVSA effective control). However, we do not expect any significant foreign investment to materialise while US sanctions remain in place.

Easing currency controls will prove difficult and will progress only slowly This category is one of the only areas of the business environment in which we expect a slight improvement in conditions, leading to a small uptick in Venezuela's global and regional ranking. This mainly reflects an easing of exchange-rate controls in 2019; individuals and companies can now buy or sell foreign currency at private and state-run banks, as well as use foreign currency for a broader range of daily transactions, which has brought the bolívar closer to its black-market value. Notwithstanding the improvement, Venezuela still ranks extremely poorly in this area. Despite the relaxation of currency controls, there are significant barriers to accessing US dollars in the context of limited supply, and the regime still intervenes in foreign-exchange markets if necessary. Moreover, we do not rule out the possibility that controls could be tightened again on the off chance that the external sector sees more material improve-ment than we anticipate. Although we expect higher average global oil prices in 2021-25 than in 2016-20, this effect will be more than offset by lower oil export volumes, meaning that the supply of foreign currency is likely to remain restricted, which will in turn hamper foreign trade. Trade policy will remain incoherent, and Venezuela will continue to be an unreliable partner, racking up significant debt in unpaid invoices to suppliers. The country has been subject to increasingly tight US sanctions on financial transactions and on the country's oil trade. Our baseline forecast is that these restrictions will remain in place.

- There has long been on-off speculation that the country's deep currency distortions might force Mr Maduro to replace the currency with the US dollar. Given the long-running cycle of hyperinflation and currency devaluation, this speculation is rising. De facto dollarisation has been expanding, both in terms of day-to-day cash transactions and also in financial transactions (facilitated by growing use of foreign-currency bank accounts, which are now permitted by the authorities). Mr Maduro's previous hostility towards the use of the US dollar has also been replaced by a more welcoming attitude. Although we believe that dollarisation will continue to expand in 2021-25, we do not believe that a wholesale replacement of the bolívar with the US dollar is likely; abandoning the bolívar would deprive the authorities of the ability to use monetary stimulus to finance the gaping budget deficit. There are also significant questions about the feasibility of shifting to full dollarisation while tight US sanctions are in place and oil production is so low, as the country already has a huge shortage of US dollars. In order to increase US dollar inflows, US sanctions would need to be eased, but this would require political compromises from the government and some sort of co-governance agreement with the opposition, which in our view is highly unlikely. In addition, currency distortions have enabled the government to expand a system of political patronage, propping up its own support by facilitating access to the US dollar.
- Difficulty in remitting profits earned in Venezuela will remain one of the most significant challenges of doing business for foreign companies operating in the country. Official permission is required to remit profits, but with critical shortages of foreign exchange, remittances face long delays. Many foreign-owned companies have not been able to remit their profits for years. In the context of huge local-currency depreciation, the US dollar value of waitlisted profit remittances has eroded significantly.
- Foreign trade will continue to suffer from US sanctions that have been in place for several years against several government figures. These have been ramped up significantly since 2017 and now also target the country's commercial infrastructure, including its financial and energy sectors. There has been speculation that sanctions policy might be re-examined under the new US administration, led by Joe Biden, but our baseline forecast is that there will be little change. Any changes to US sanctions policy would be on humanitarian grounds and would focus on facilitating swap agreements (such as exchanging unrefined crude for refined petroleum, which would ease pressure on power generation and help the agricultural sector). The Biden administration may also explore the option of allowing exchanges of oil for basic commodities such as food and medicine. However, we do not expect the wholesale lifting of sanctions; as such, foreign investors will remain wary, which will suppress both trade and investment with Venezuela.

Improvements in the tax regime are unlikely given fiscal constraints The tax regime will remain a barrier to investment, with fiscal constraints prompting a further deterioration in this area during the forecast period. Rates of direct corporate taxation are currently moderate, with a top corporate income tax rate of 34% (excluding oil companies, for which the rate is set at 50%), but tax laws, regulations and procedures are complicated, inconsistent and subject to frequent arbitrary adjustments. The system is extremely complex; compliance with tax requirements requires businesses to make dozens of separate payments each year, which is hugely time-consuming (on both measures, Venezuela is about three times worse than the Latin American average). The tax burden is heavy, accounting for 73% of profits (the regional average is 47%). A series of new taxes introduced in 2009 doubled the effective tax rate on earnings in many cases. These taxes formed part of wider reforms such as a sports law, a new science and technology law, a worker-training law, and a municipal law, but included new fiscal charges on businesses-some of which are levied on gross revenue rather than net earnings.

- It is difficult to assess exactly how narrow the tax base is; according to the latest official data disclosed by the Servicio Nacional Integrado de Administración Aduanera y Tributaria (Seniat, the tax authority), tax income accounted for just 12% of GDP in 2012. Seniat regularly reports large increases in tax collection, but given hyperinflation, tax collection is actually shrinking in real terms, which implies that the tax base has shrunk even further since 2012. Despite this, the central government has shown little interest in raising tax rates, as Mr Maduro has financed the huge fiscal deficit through public debt issuance, which is monetised. However, municipal authorities have been raising effective tax rates in recent months, which has increased the tax burden on businesses. Municipalities have traditionally relied on central government transfers for funding, but these have dried up in recent years. Legislation passed in August 2020 to harmonise various municipal taxes included a provision that allowed municipal authorities to use the petro (a state-issued crypto-currency) as a unit of account for tax calculation. The provision has in effect allowed municipalities to base their tax calculations in US dollar terms (as the price of the petro is pegged to the dollar value of a barrel of oil). As a result, businesses have faced huge increases in their local tax bills, but with many still earning revenue in the increasingly worthless bolívar, they have become overleveraged. We expect the central government to eventually step in to repeal the petro-related provision (or pass a law that caps municipal tax rates), but this is unlikely to occur until the central government's own finances are on a better footing.
- The fiscal regime will do little to encourage new investment in 2021-25. In theory, Venezuela offers both foreign and domestic investors a full and equal range of investment incentives, including tax exemptions, special credit financing and export incentives. The federal government also operates a number of state-run lending institutions that focus on micro, small and medium-sized businesses. The Corporación Venezolana de Guayana, the state industrial-holding company, offers investment incentives, as do many states and municipalities. However, there is no evidence that the Maduro regime is actually making the benefits of these investment incentives available to businesses.

Financing conditions will remain difficult Venezuela's score and ranking for financing remain dismal in the forecast period. The banking sector is weak and will struggle to provide reliable access to medium-term finance for the private sector. Financial sector distortions will remain severe, with the regime set to continue its policy of directed lending, which requires private banks to channel credit to specific sectors (including agriculture, mortgages and tourism) at preferential rates. Despite huge increases in nominal lending in local-currency terms, this reflects captive domestic liquidity, hyperinflation and deeply negative real interest rates. In both real and US dollar terms, the financial sector has shrunk dramatically in recent years, resulting in an extremely shallow credit market. We do not expect any significant improvement in underlying conditions in the financial sector during 2021-25; as such, financing will remain a major weakness of the business environment throughout the forecast period.

- The soundness of the financial system and the quality of regulation will remain significant concerns. Legislative changes in recent years have not resulted in a tighter regulatory framework but have simply established new layers of bureaucracy. There has been no concerted effort to tackle the patchy enforcement of existing regulations. Weak skills in regulatory agencies and political meddling in oversight will remain problems and will continue to undermine efforts to identify ailing banks at an early stage. The quality of financial sector regulation is unlikely to improve, given a lack of political will.
- State intervention will continue to have an impact on the health and profitability of the banking industry. The state already has a substantial direct presence in the industry through full ownership of three of the top ten banks and is prone to intervention in private-sector lenders.

Large-scale emigration will hamper the labour market in 2021-25 The labour market was the strongest area of the business environment in the 2016-20 historical period, but we expect conditions to deteriorate in 2021-25, with Venezuela's global and regional ranking slipping significantly. This mainly reflects increased skills shortages following the departure of large numbers of Venezuelans in recent years. Few of the skilled Venezuelans who have left the country are likely to return until the economy is on a much firmer footing, if at all. Although several governments in the region (including Chile, Peru and Ecuador) have clamped down on illegal immigration from Venezuela, the US and Colombian governments have granted Venezuelan migrants legal status. Outward migration will continue, as the domestic economic situation remains critical. The economy's informal sector is large and employs the vast majority of the country's workers. The highly distorted exchange-rate system makes it difficult to assess wage costs in US dollar terms compared with the rest of the region. Venezuela's labour laws were already among the most rigid in the world, even before a highly restrictive labour reform came into effect in 2012. This increased non-wage costs considerably: obligatory non-wage costs, employers' social security contributions, mandatory profit sharing, and childcare and food allowances added more than 70% to the basic wage costs for large and medium-sized companies, and 30% for smaller companies. As part of the government's coronavirus response, firms are prohibited from firing workers until December 2022.

- The mass exodus of Venezuelans from the country will put significant constraints on the labour market during 2021-25, particularly in terms of companies' ability to find skilled labour. According to the UN, an estimated 5.6m Venezuelans-nearly a fifth of the population-had fled the country as at April. Although outward migration virtually halted with the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic, with some reports of Venezuelans even returning across land borders as informal sector work in Colombia and Brazil dried up, the number of Venezuelans leaving the country has started to pick up again in recent months. This will worsen skill shortages further. The situation will be aggravated by the fact that chronic underinvestment in education in recent years means that even basic skills are scarce in much of the workforce, while political interference in universities and technical colleges has damaged the quality of the country's tertiary education system.
- Even once current coronavirus-related restrictions (which bar firms from firing workers until the end of 2022) are lifted, the labour market will remain extremely inflexible. Staffing levels (excluding managers, short-term workers and high-income earners) can be reduced only via collective agreement. Many workers cannot be fired at all, even in cases of stealing company property or failing to come to work. In practice, companies looking to shed staff are forced to negotiate "voluntary redundancy" agreements with workers; these typically centre on extremely generous severance payments, further adding to employ-ment costs. Employment tribunals are generally hostile to private-sector employers, a factor used by workers and union representatives to their advantage. Moreover, companies that make recourse to voluntary redundancies have at times been targeted for nationalisation, representing a further disincentive for the private sector.

Electricity provision will remain a critically weak area of infrastructure Following years of mismanagement and underinvestment, Venezuela's infra-structure has fallen into critical disrepair, and we expect further slippage in 2021-25. Repeated pledges by the regime to implement ambitious infrastructure projects have come to nothing, and state-funded investment has dried up entirely in recent years. Even routine maintenance has not been completed, with current prolonged power shortages and limited access to running water the most visible manifestations of the failure to sustain basic service provision. A combination of fiscal constraints and US sanctions means that it is difficult to attract long-term foreign direct investment (FDI) into capital projects, which will compound the dismal state of the country's infrastructure. Given pervasive corruption in state institutions and the fact that the sovereign remains in default on external debt commitments, even multilateral assistance is unlikely to be forthcoming. Even if a new, more market-friendly government took office during the forecast period (not our baseline scenario), reversing the long-term underinvestment in infrastructure would take many years.

- Reliable access to electricity will be one of the most significant challenges for businesses operating in Venezuela in 2021-25. Although the country has long faced sporadic power outages, the situation has deteriorated sharply in recent years, which on occasion has forced the government to request that workers remain at home while the authorities try to restore power. Some companies have opted to install backup generators, but this is a costly solution that does not solve all operational problems, as it can be difficult to find fuel. The supply of fresh water has been seriously affected, and communication, financial and transport networks have also been interrupted. Insufficient investment in maintaining the generation and transmission systems in recent years are to blame. Water levels at the Guri dam, which generates most of the country's hydropower (which in turn accounts for more than 50% of total electricity generation), have recovered from critically low levels in 2020, but power generation at the dam is considerably lower than the total installed capacity of 24,000 MW, owing to recent damage to several transformers. Even if the government had the funds, overhauling the entire system would take years, meaning that blackouts and electricity rationing will persist throughout the forecast period.

Venezuela is ill-prepared for technological disruption As in most areas of the business environment rankings, Venezuela's weak technological readiness ranking worsens in 2021-25. The crisis will take its toll on the telecommunications sector, with falls in disposable income adding to a decline in mobile-phone penetration (which has fallen from 102% in 2013 to about 60% currently). Internet penetration has been more stable (at about 60% since 2014), but there are major discrepancies across regions. Given that these areas are crucial drivers of wider technological developments, including mobile apps and cloud computing, declines are important factors in Venezuela's weak score.
Skills shortages will undermine Venezuela's long-term growth
- Chronic underinvestment in scientific and technical skills and extensive "brain drain" limit Venezuela's technological readiness. Acute skills shortages in technology will not be resolved in the short term, and private investors will wait for the political and economic situation to improve significantly (which is unlikely in 2021-25) before making substantial capital expenditure commitments.
- Local use of cryptocurrencies (or digital currencies) has rocketed in recent years amid declining confidence in the increasingly worthless bolívar. Adjusted for GDP, Venezuela engages in more cryptocurrency trading than any other country. As well as its primary functions as a store of value and a medium of exchange, cryptocurrency is attractive for Venezuelans because it is virtually impossible for the government to regulate the market. In this context, crypto-currency adoption is likely to expand in 2021-25. Nonetheless, cryptocurrency will not supersede the US dollar given the untested fundamentals of the crypto market. Adoption will be hindered by extremely poor internet infrastructure (especially outside the capital, Caracas); Venezuela ranks 79th in The Economist Intelligence Unit's Inclusive Internet Index, which measures indicators of internet inclusion, such as accessibility and affordability across 120 countries.

Economic forecast: Policy trends The immediate policy priorities of the regime led by Nicolás Maduro will be to contain the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak and to halt a long-running economic collapse, but progress on both will be uneven. To combat the coronavirus pandemic, a "Fórmula 7+7 Plus" strategy remains in place, which involves alternating between a week of tighter restrictions and a week of more relaxed restrictions. However, this has failed to prevent fresh waves of the virus, increasing pressure on Venezuela's decrepit medical infrastructure. Efforts by the regime to procure vaccines are making slow progress; so far, Venezuela has received 380,000 doses of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine and 500,000 doses of China's Sinopharm vaccine, but the rollout has been slow (as at mid-April less than 1% of the population had received at least one dose). Mr Maduro says that a total of 10m Sputnik V doses will arrive this year, but deliveries have been intermittent and quantities low. The government hopes to obtain 11m vaccine doses through the WHO-led COVAX Facility. Following payment in mid-April, some of these vaccines should start arriving, but the politicisation of distribution and rampant corruption will hinder the vaccination campaign. Against this backdrop, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect that enough doses of the vaccine will be distributed to have a significant impact on local transmission until 2023.
Addressing the long-running economic decline will be a similarly difficult task. Given that the public sector is completely overstretched, lacking the resources to increase productive capacity, Mr Maduro is seeking to boost private investment in order to generate an economic recovery. To this end, in October 2020 the regime promulgated an anti-blockade law, which gives the executive branch the unchecked authority to sign confidential new deals with private firms and countries (in an attempt to skirt international sanctions) without going through public tender processes.
In November the regime used the law to sell Agropatria, a state-owned agri-cultural firm, to Grupo Agrollano, a private company of unknown origin. We expect that the regime will similarly seek to reprivatise a number of other businesses that had been nationalised by Mr Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chávez (1999-2013), but were run aground by cronyism and mismanagement. The regime will also encourage greater private-sector participation in the oil industry, but it will refrain from outright privatisation of PDVSA (the state oil company). These efforts are unlikely to yield significant results; even assuming that the regime manages to sidestep financial sanctions, it will struggle to attract new investment, given the abysmal business environment and a lack of confidence in the rule of law.

Government debt 301.6 326.5 334.4 353.5 371.2 391.9
The authorities have not published complete data on the fiscal accounts since 2011. However, we expect that a high level of inefficient current expenditure, combined with an extremely weak revenue intake, will keep the budget deficit wide and the public debt/GDP ratio astronomical throughout the 2021-25 forecast period. The sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will continue to shut off access to external finance, leaving the regime reliant on monetisation to fund its deficits. Even if the government reaches an agreement with some of its creditors (including China) to restructure debt liabilities during 2021-25, we still expect the public debt burden to remain huge particularly as considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing-mainly PDVSA-issued debt and development funds-understate the true size of total public liabilities.

Monetary policy will remain subservient to fiscal policy, as the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) continues to print money to finance the government's gaping budget deficits. The BCV has, in recent years, taken steps to control growth of monetary aggregates. For instance, in early 2019 it lifted the cash reserve ratio (CRR) to 100%; although it has relaxed the CRR slightly since that peak, to 85% currently. Moreover, far from taming inflation, these measures have led to the complete destruction of private-sector credit, which stands at less than 1% of levels recorded four years ago.
These factors have accelerated the trend towards greater use of US dollars in the economy. According to private-sector estimates, two-thirds of all financial transactions are now made in US dollars. This share is likely to rise further following Mr Maduro's January announcement that banks would be authorised to expand the use of foreign-currency bank accounts. The regime has even allowed private companies to issue debt in hard currency in order to raise finance; in November 2020 Ron Santa Teresa, a domestic rum producer, became the first company in more than two decades to issue dollar-denominated bonds (worth US$300,000) on the Caracas Stock Exchange; there are reports that some other firms are planning similar issuance. Although progress will be gradual, we believe that Venezuela is ultimately headed towards greater de facto dollarisation.

After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 31% in 2020 (and a cumulative contraction of almost 77% since 2013), we forecast marginally positive growth of 0.7% in 2021. GDP is now strongly correlated with oil production. Having plummeted to an average of 500,000 barrels/day in 2020-its lowest level in several decades-crude production will stabilise in 2021 as global energy demand starts to recover. PDVSA's ability to ramp up oil production more significantly will be limited, given the absence of any active oil rigs in the country. Moreover, prospects for investment are bleak: at present, Venezuela's average break-even price is about US$15-20/barrel. However, US sanctions on the regime raise the risks involved in dealing with Venezuela, forcing the country to offer a hefty discount on its crude. That said, there are some upside risks to our assumptions. Oil prices have recovered following losses in 2020, giving potential buyers stronger incentives to find ways around US sanctions. Moreover, even in the absence of active rigs, it is possible that PDVSA could extract more crude than we anticipate from existing oil wells. For its part, the non-oil economy will experience little improvement, especially as an uncontrolled pandemic limits prospects for services activities.
We expect growth to pick up in 2022, assuming that oil prices remain supportive and that producers continue to adapt to post-sanctions export markets. However, serious operational problems (such as difficulties in obtaining equipment for repairs and finding qualified staff), a limited pool of buyers of Venezuelan crude and the weak long-term fundamentals of the oil market will cause growth to taper off towards the end of our forecast period. The non-oil economy will also make modest gains in 2022-25, assuming that continued dollarisation supports relative macroeconomic stability. Nonetheless, we expect that Venezuela's GDP (in real terms) will be only about half its 2018 level, even in 2025.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends With proven levels surpassing 300bn barrels, Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world, making it a major oil producer and exporter. However, the energy sector has suffered from disinvestment and mismanagement owing to political interference. The state is accorded exclusive ownership of PDVSA and its subsidiaries. Since 2007 oil exploration, extraction and storage activities have been reserved for state-owned enterprises or companies in which the state holds a stake of at least 60%.
Venezuelan oil production, which has been in a downward spiral for several years now, plunged further in 2020. OPEC data indicate that oil output averaged just 500,000 b/d in 2020, down from 796,000 b/d in 2019 and the weakest result in 77 years. Oil production has been in freefall for over a decade, but the decline in output in the past five years has been particularly stark, falling from 2.4m b/d in 2015. Initially, this reflected severe operational constraints at PDVSA that made it increasingly difficult for the firm to maintain production, let alone invest in exploration in order to lift future capacity. The steady exodus of foreign players, which were mainly in the oil services subsector, continued amid an extremely hostile business environment. More recently, a tightening of US sanctions has aggravated problems by hindering imports of diluents required for the blending of Venezuela's predominantly heavy and extra-heavy oil. US sanctions have also sharply reduced the pool of potential buyers, making Venezuela reliant on selling crude exports via third-party intermediaries in order to evade sanctions, at a sharp discount.
We remain pessimistic about prospects for the oil sector. The number of active oil-drilling rigs in Venezuela fell from 25 in the first quarter of 2020 to just one mid-year, and since August there have been no active rigs in the country. Although this does not mean that production will cease (or even continue to decline), given that existing platforms can theoretically extract crude, it still suggests that output will not recover significantly. The government is targeting a recovery in oil production to 1.5m b/d this year and has indicated that it would welcome fresh private investment. This acknowledgement is a reflection of the fact that PDVSA remains in a critically poor state, with failure to maintain facilities contributing to frequent oil spills and accidents at processing facilities. In recent years the company has also been affected by a loss of technical capacity, as many skilled workers have left the country. Moreover, given that its finances are stretched to the limit-PDVSA is in arrears on all of its global bonds and state efforts to obtain fresh financing from allies such as China and Russia have stalled-the company can ill afford to invest in capacity upgrades by itself.
However, we do not expect any significant private investment to materialise as long as US sanctions remain in place. In our view, the US administration, led by Joe Biden, is unlikely to provide significant sanctions relief in the absence of major political compromises and commitments to democratic reforms on the part of the Maduro regime, which remain highly unlikely. Mr Maduro has indicated that he will look to revive the Venezuelan oil industry by promoting private investment in the sector. The president has also suggested that he will seek to evade sanctions by taking advantage of a recently passed anti-blockade law, which gives the executive branch the unchecked authority to sign confidential new deals with private firms and countries. The Maduro regime has signalled that it will table a reform to the hydrocarbons law that would, among other things, abolish PDVSA's 60% equity requirement in joint ventures, flexibilise labour rules, reduce oil royalties and provide exemptions for municipal taxes. Reportedly, regime officials have already begun meeting with some domestic firms to propose allowing them to operate oilfields owned by PDVSA. However, we remain sceptical about prospects for large-scale invest-ments given the discretionary legal framework, the abysmal state of local infrastructure and the high costs of doing business. Against this backdrop, we expect oil production to be severely constrained even in the medium term, averaging only about 580,000 b/d in 2021-25.

A severely reduced domestic goods supply, constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits will impede the disinflationary process in 2021-25. The regime has shown little inclination to take on the fiscal and macroeconomic reforms that would address the root causes of inflation. It has, however, lent its support to an ongoing process of de facto dollarisation, which will help to ease price pressures over time.

Hyperinflation will sustain bolívar depreciation in 2021. Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency redenomination (as in March 2018) or a new currency is a strong possibility. Even though a number of currency regulations officially remain on the books, the regime has largely stopped enforcing them in its recent embrace of dollarisation. Although a black market for US dollars continues to operate, the premium is modest compared with previous years (mainly because the authorities have let the official bolívar rate depreciate more substantially). On April 23rd the black-market exchange rate stood at BsS2,780,444:US$1, only marginally above the official exchange rate of BsS2,506,330:US$1.

Balance-of-payments pressures will remain severe in 2021-25, contributing to goods shortages and economic inequities. Foreign reserves stood at US$6.2bn in March-their lowest level in three decades. The steep decline in reserves, which has been several years in the making, reflects poor policymaking and a lack of economic diversification in the country's external sector.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect reserves to rise modestly over the forecast period, reaching US$7.8bn by end-2025. We expect this increase to be driven entirely by trends on the current account, as Venezuela's access to foreign capital will remain extremely limited. We expect the current-account balance to shift from an estimated deficit of 7.3% of GDP in 2020 to a surplus of 1.2% of GDP in 2021. Thereafter, it will remain in surplus, averaging 2.8% of GDP in 2022-25. Our forecast rests on the assumption that export earnings will pick up from a nadir in 2020 as international oil prices recover and the country steps up trade with new buyers in Asia. We also expect that workers' remittances from abroad will play a crucial role in propping up the current-account balance as Venezuelan emigrants are gradually absorbed into the labour markets in their host countries.
Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Venezuela Stocks and flows According to the IMF (whose figures differ somewhat from local sources), the stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Venezuela stood at US$30.1bn in 2016, the last year in which actual data have been provided. This is about a third less than a peak of US$48.9bn in 2007, primarily owing to significant disinvestment, notwithstanding the government's long-standing capital controls. Based on data released by the UN Conference on Trade and Development since then, The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the FDI stock has increased marginally, to US$32.2bn in 2020. Following a precipitous decline in GDP in recent years, we estimate that the FDI stock stood at 63% of GDP in 2020. Overall, FDI inflows have been extremely volatile in the past 20 years, affected by both political and macroeconomic factors. During the oil opening of 1996-98, inward FDI peaked at an annual average of US$4.5bn per year. By historical standards, inward FDI held up well in the first three years of the presidency of Hugo Chávez (1999-2013), averaging US$3.8bn per year in 1999-2001. As political conflict intensified, FDI inflows began to decline in 2002-08 (averaging US$1.8bn per year), and in 2009-a year of great volatility in the world economy and adverse domestic developments in Venezuela-the country registered disinvestment of US$1.1bn (some negative inflows were also the result of compensation for nationalisations). Inward FDI recovered afterwards, averaging an estimated US$4.3bn per year in 2011-13, because of greater investment from China in energy and housing. Inward FDI weakened considerably after Nicolás Maduro, the current leader, took power, averaging US$1.1bn in 2014-20, reflecting a much weaker international oil price environment, as well as foreign investors' growing disillusionment with the government's inability to comply with investment agreements and manage the economy. Outbound FDI in Venezuela is considerable but is largely dominated by investments abroad by PDVSA, the state oil company. According to the IMF, the stock of outward FDI stood at US$32.7bn in 2016; we estimate that it to rose to US$36.8bn in 2020.
Origin and distribution The energy sector, and oil in particular, remains the main magnet for FDI. US and European oil companies have major investments in the country, even after forced changes to the ownership structure of most contracts. After oil, banking and communications have been the main recipients of FDI. Spanish banks have the largest foreign presence in the financial sector, although the Venezuelan state has bought back some operations. Other notable FDI inflows come from Chile (in forestry activities) and Canada (in the mining industry). Owing to wide-ranging US sanctions and restricted access to external finance, short-term efforts will focus on courting investment from China, Russia and Iran, although these efforts are likely to yield limited success.
Determinants Following a period of booming FDI inflows in the 1990s, driven by oil and telecommunications openings, an uncertain political and policy environment-including threats of nationalisation-and a volatile macroeconomic climate have kept FDI well below potential, particularly in the non-extractive sectors. In the extractive sector, FDI inflows have been affected by the government's restrictive hydrocarbons investment regime, which mandates that PDVSA must hold a minimum 60% stake in the oil and gas sector, and levies high taxes and royalties on private partners. The vast reserves of extra-heavy oil in the Orinoco Belt require substantial technical know-how and massive investment to be put to production, an environment where major oil companies would thrive. Many major companies are already present via joint ventures or were already present before nationalisation drives. Venezuela's oil sector would continue to be a major draw for FDI under more sustainable economic and regulatory policies.
Impact Foreign investment in oil brought accelerated growth in output, from 2.4m barrels/day in 1994 to a peak of 3.4m b/d in 1999. Foreign investment in the extractive sector has fallen since then, contributing to a decline in oil output, reinforced by PDVSA's inability to drive production. Foreign involvement has had a less dramatic impact in other sectors, such as domestic manufacturing and services, resulting in high levels of import dependence. As FDI has flowed mostly into capital-intensive industries, its impact on employment and skills levels has been limited.
Potential Given the scale of economic mismanagement and poor maintenance of existing infrastructure and productive capacity, there is large potential for investment opportunities in Venezuela. Potentially attractive opportunities for FDI exist in an array of sectors, such as oil and gas, petrochemicals, coal, aluminium, gold, forestry, power, tourism, and telecoms. There is additional potential in some manufacturing and agricultural niches (for example leather goods, cocoa and rum). However, FDI inflows will be severely curtailed by concerns about the government's policy stance, difficulties in accessing foreign exchange, the weak macroeconomic environment and the fragility of the legal framework. A recovery in investment is unlikely under Mr Maduro, as exchange-rate distortions and controls on local prices will remain unaddressed. A more noticeable upturn in FDI inflows will have to wait until after a political transition takes place, and only if the new government were to engage in structural economic reforms.

As long as the current regime is in place, mass emigration will continue Population growth will remain weak because of a falling birth rate and large-scale emigration. Annual population growth has been slowing steadily, from 2.6% in the 1980s to 2.1% in the 1990s and 1.6% in 2000-10. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the population declined by an average of 0.4% per year in the 2016-20 historical period as the economic crisis worsened. The UN High Commission for Refugees estimates that 5.6m Venezuelans have left the country since 2014, with about 1.7m residing in neighbouring Colombia. However, the onset of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic brought a halt to the incessant outmigration; the Colombian authorities estimate that more than 120,000 Venezuelans left Colombia in 2020 and returned to their home country owing to a pandemic-led dearth of economic opportunities Nonetheless, the inversion in migration flows will be short-lived. Regional economies will gradually reopen in 2021-22; this, together with a lack of employment and goods shortages at home, will cause migrants to continue leaving Venezuela. Our projections for population growth in the 2021-25 forecast period therefore assume that outward migration will continue. We expect the total population to decline to 28.1m by 2025 (from an estimated peak of 30.9m in 2016), with just under a quarter of the population aged 14 and under, and two-thirds of the population between 15 and 64 years of age. Population density is low, at 33 people/sq km, according to World Bank estimates from 2018. Distribution between urban and rural areas is highly uneven, with about 90% of the total population living in urban centres. Underdeveloped rural infrastructure and limited job opportunities in the countryside will result in a continuing trend of urbanisation in 2021-25.
Official statistics belie the destruction of the labour market Analysis of the labour market is complicated by a lack of credibility in official statistics. Based on official numbers, the labour force participation rate declined from 75% in 2004 to 70% in 2013 (owing to increased uptake of education, linked to the government's social programmes). Since then, the participation rate has reportedly been on an upward trend, reaching 73% in 2018. The labour market data, however, are at odds with official figures for economic activity, which show that real GDP has been on a downward spiral since 2014. In our view, labour force participation is likely to have declined in recent years, as deteriorating economic conditions are likely to have discouraged potential job-seekers from entering the market. Our own projections assume that the labour force participation rate fell from 70% in 2013 to 65% in 2018 and to 56% in 2020. We believe that the long-running economic depression, combined with a steep decline in real wages (we estimate that, in real terms, the minimum wage plus food vouchers has lost over 99% of its value since mid-2013), will have had a pronounced impact on the size of the workforce. We expect participation rates to remain subdued in 2021-25. A poor business environment, economic malaise and extremely restrictive labour regulation will limit job creation, forcing more people to depend on the informal sector, which is already estimated to account for more than half of employment.
According to the national statistics institute (INE), the unemployment rate fell from 15% in 2010 to 7% in 2018. Although the INE has not produced unemploy-ment statistics since 2018, a recent publication by the Ministry of Planning indicates that the official unemployment rate stood at 8.8% in the first half of 2020. Even accounting for extremely inflexible labour laws, these data seem extremely detached from the country's economic realities. Our own projections assume that the unemployment rate stood at almost 50% in full-year 2020.
Public services will remain under strain from a lack of resources The old-age dependency ratio will remain low by developed-country standards but, in the context of volatile public finances, population ageing will place growing pressure on the heavily burdened social security system. Public hospitals will continue to suffer from crumbling infrastructure and a lack of supplies (including medicines) and equipment. Equipment is mainly imported or assembled from imported parts, and supplies have fallen victim to a lack of US dollars. Programmes to build and rebuild hospitals have failed owing to mismanagement of funds and shortages of building materials. Even a parallel welfare system, the Sistema Nacional de Misiones, is struggling to function as the government makes cuts and inflation erodes purchasing power. Overall, we therefore expect the provision and quality of public healthcare and education services to deteriorate further, exacerbated by the rampant Covid-19 pandemic. The continued worsening will also reflect long-running problems, including a pronounced deficit of technical and basic skills, and the continued emigration of professionals (particularly doctors and nurses).

The scale of Venezuela's economic crisis has led to a rapid decline in living standards, with GDP per head falling by more than two-thirds, from a peak of US$12,921 in 2012 to an estimated US$1,719 in 2020. Estimates using purchasing power parity (PPP) give a higher figure, of US$4,114. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects only a modest improvement in both GDP per head at market exchange rates and at PPP by 2025, driven largely by increased oil production and improved macroeconomic stability (facilitated by the expansion of dollarisation in the economy). The scope for further enhancement of living standards during the 2021-25 forecast period will be constrained by structural economic deficiencies, which are unlikely to be remedied under the current regime, led by Nicolás Maduro.
Several factors will restrict purchasing power, including rampant inflation and persistently high poverty and income inequality. Official statistics show dramatic and sustained improvement across myriad social indicators in recent years, but these data have been disputed. According to the government, the multi-dimensional poverty rate has fallen consistently, from 29.6% in 2004 to 20.4% in 2014 and to 17% in 2018. However, these data contrast starkly with independent measures of multidimensional poverty. According to the Encuesta Nacional de Condiciones de Vida (Encovi, an annual survey conducted by three well-regarded local universities), the poverty rate rose from 39% in 2014 to 68% in 2019.
The government does not produce separate statistics on measures of inequality, but Encovi data indicate extremely wide income gaps in the country. Based on Encovi figures, Venezuela's Gini index score-a measure of income inequality that ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 100 (complete inequality)-rose from 40.7 in 2014 to a peak of 68.7 in 2017, before falling to 51 in 2019, probably driven by the exodus of middle- and high-income Venezuelans. Despite this, Venezuela remains one of the most unequal countries in the region and in the world.
Investment potential will only be tapped after a political transition Venezuela is a reasonably sized consumer market and has the potential to become an attractive investment location. However, any benefits from this will not materialise until a more market-friendly administration takes over (not our baseline forecast). The country has vast reserves of natural resources (including oil, gas, coal and precious metals), an array of spectacular natural tourist attractions, relatively good physical infrastructure and a fairly favourable geographical location (given its proximity to the US). However, poor economic policies have contributed to a volatile GDP profile and deteriorations of public services and human capital over the past two decades. The unattractiveness of the business environment is compounded by inadequate contract and property rights. Moreover, a deterioration in the quality of healthcare and education provision in the past three decades have contributed to an erosion of skills and productivity, exacerbated by an exodus of talented individuals to work abroad.

Retail sales volumes will be subdued in 2021-25 As in the rest of Latin America, spending on food, beverages and tobacco accounts for the largest share of total consumer expenditure; this will remain the case throughout the forecast period. Most consumer goods industries will remain underdeveloped owing to government controls and the country's severely damaged productive capacity. Moreover, limited availability of foreign exchange has resulted in a scarcity of consumer goods that are not produced domestically. The weak outlook for economic recovery will subdue retail sales volumes throughout the 2021-25 forecast period.

Although The Economist Intelligence Unit assumes that the leader of the regime, Nicolás Maduro, will retain power in the short to medium term, we expect successive governments to put forth structural reforms to the oil sector and to make limited inroads in diversifying the economy in the longer term. On this basis, we anticipate that Venezuela's real GDP per head will grow by an annual average of 2.2% in 2021-30 (following a steep contraction of 13.5% in the preceding decade). Growth will average a healthier 4.2% in 2031-50, but the country's population is unlikely to reach a high standard of living in those years. Indeed, by 2050 we forecast that per-head GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) will be US$21,767-low for a country with Venezuela's endowment of national resources. Although we expect the business environment to improve, the country's weak institutions, dependence on the extractive industry and a weak productive base will remain significant barriers to growth.
The macroeconomic collapse will impair the long-term productivity capacity Initial conditions: After averaging growth of 10% in 2004-08, real GDP fell sharply in 2009-10. Although the economy recovered in 2011-12 on the back of aggressive fiscal spending, growth slowed sharply again in 2013, with the economy slipping into a deepening recession in late 2014. We estimate that, by the time the economy returns to growth in 2021, real GDP will have fallen by almost 75%, making the recession the country's most severe since compilation of national statistics data began. The heterodox policy framework that has been in place for over a decade has been a major factor in hampering GDP growth, and an opaque and distorted exchange-rate system has provided opportunities for large-scale corruption, further undermining the institutional framework and maintaining income inequality. Institutional deterioration is deep-rooted and will prove harder to reverse. On a more positive note, a higher skills base and reasonably good road infrastructure by regional standards provide scope for faster overall growth and a rise in personal incomes. Nevertheless, under-investment in human capital and infrastructure, as well as the emigration of most skilled labour, is eroding these advantages and, given fiscal difficulties, this trend will take time to reverse. Successive governments have failed to take advantage of Venezuela's proximity to developed US and European markets relative to its South American neighbours, as internal geography and a lack of infrastructure investment in the interior have limited its chances of becoming a regional hub for transport and commerce.
Demographic trends: As in most other emerging markets, growth in the working-age population will slow in the long term while rising participation rates will drive brisker growth of the labour force. Venezuela will continue to enjoy supportive population dynamics, with the dependency ratio of old to young low by OECD standards, even in 2050. Despite a steady rise in life expectancy, the share of the population aged 65 years and over will be only about 11% in 2050, whereas the share of the population at working age will remain high, at 69%. A particular risk to productivity is the "brain drain" of recent years, as many experienced professionals have left the country to work abroad with no guarantee of returning.
Oil will remain crucial to Venezuela's economic prospects External conditions: We estimate that oil accounts for close to 95% of export revenue at present and expect it to continue to dominate the Venezuelan economy. Although there will be a limited drive to diversify the productive base in the long term, Venezuela will remain highly dependent on exports of oil and other commodities. Under Hugo Chávez (1999-2013) and now under Mr Maduro, Venezuela and its allies have taken a confrontational stance against US policy and US-led efforts at economic integration. In the medium term, we expect Venezuela to continue to rely heavily on oil and extractive industries, and to strengthen economic links with Asian markets and existing political allies (such as Russia, Turkey and Iran). In the longer term, however, we assume that successive governments will implement a number of structural economic and political reforms, which will allow Venezuela to diversify away from oil to some degree, breathing life back into trade with the US.
Institutions and policy trends: We assume that some of the most distortionary elements of the current policy framework (including price and exchange controls) will be scaled back gradually, as the regime considers that doing so is essential to its survival. However, prospects for improvements in other areas of the business environment are low, as structural microeconomic reforms will not be forthcoming. For example, improvement in the public finances will prove unfeasible unless international crude prices reach pre-2014 levels. Given that the economy will remain highly vulnerable to oil price fluctuations, the fiscal position will be highly procyclical. Reforms to social security or labour legislation will only be possible under a future administration. In 2031-50 we assume that successive governments will bring in policy improvements, but gains will be slow to materialise given the country's institutional weakness.
Long-term performance: Even once the most distortionary elements of current economic policy have been abandoned, Venezuela's GDP growth potential will be constrained by the deterioration of the skills base over the past decade. However, there is still scope for recovery in 2031-40, when growth will average a respectable 5.9%, before slowing to an average of 4.3% in 2041-50. Higher GDP growth rates would be possible in the long term under new, more market-friendly administrations, which we expect would pursue reforms to the country's long-standing economic and political policies. The overall economy will remain vulnerable to continuing boom and bust cycles, with negative consequences for macroeconomic stability and growth. This will hamper prospects for catch-up with more developed economies, despite some solid projected growth later in the 2021-50 long-term forecast period.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Venezuela is vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, owing both to its geographical limitations and the government's inadequate focus on preparedness. Venezuela is deemed extremely vulnerable to climate change, given its population distribution along coastal lines on unstable terrains. About 75% of the country's population is estimated to live in the 20% of the territory facing the Caribbean Sea. Given low infrastructure maintenance and little disaster preparedness, the population centres there are exposed to torrential rains, mudslides and flash floods. According to a recent study by a local and internationally recognised expert, Juan Carlos Sanchez, even within established rainfall patterns, variance has resulted in a rising number of extreme events per year in the past decade. Longer-term trends in rainfall will also affect the country. A study by the Universidad Simón Bolívar, a well-regarded local university, concluded that rainfall in the northwest of the country could fall by 25% by 2060. This would not only cause internal migration, but would also drive the country into further food insecurity (Venezuela is already heavily reliant on imports of foodstuffs). In addition, changing rain patterns may disrupt hydroelectricity generation, a major problem given that this represents more than 50% of the country's electricity.
The government has done little to address these challenges. Its public works programmes concentrate on traditional infra-structure projects, and minimal attention is given to disaster preparedness. Official data on carbon emissions and pollution in the country are scarce, but environmental policies are generally deemed poor by specialised observers. PDVSA, the state-owned oil firm, has been routinely accused of poor environmental protection in both its oil and gas operations. The Economist Intelligence Unit has developed a model to calculate the impact of climate change on long-term growth; we find that the Venezuelan economy will be almost 5% smaller in 2050 than it would have been without this hit to growth.
Migration and urbanisation Venezuela experienced rapid urbanisation through the majority of the second half of the 20th century, when the country's oil wealth was developed. According to data from the World Bank, the percentage of the population living in urban centres grew from 60% in 1960 to almost 90% by the late 1990s-high by global standards but in line with most large Latin American countries. Oil exports, especially at the start of this process, funded large-scale real-estate developments and infrastructure works in budding urban centres, attracting prospective workers from the countryside. In addition to a growing middle class fed by spillover from the country's oil wealth, the exodus from rural areas to cities created sprawling shanty-towns across major metropolises, which public-housing programmes have been unable to eradicate. Income inequality in urban centres is especially acute, feeding crime and political tension. This is perhaps best exemplified in Caracas, the capital, where income and wealth disparities have correlated with voter preferences for either the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) or for opposition parties.
Emigration, previously a limited phenomenon, has become a major issue. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, a total of 5.6m Venezuelans (representing about a fifth of the current population) have left the country since 2013, with most having left in the past four years. These migrants were initially primarily driven by political reasons, but the exodus is also driven by criminal violence (Venezuela has one of the world's highest murder rates) and woeful economic conditions. Anecdotal evidence suggests that those leaving have been primarily young, well-trained professionals, which has harmed the country's economic prospects further. Under our expectation of no political transition in the short term, outward migration will continue (albeit at a slower pace than in 2018-20). Skilled workers in particular will seek to move abroad, further dampening Venezuela's long-term growth potential.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2016-20) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2021-25). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2016-20. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2021-25 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2016-20 ranges are then used to derive 2021-25 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2021-25, not to the likely situation in 2025 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2018 or 2023). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - The tenure of the president, Muhammadu Buhari, will last until 2023 and be blemished by a decline in living standards caused by recession in 2020, a rise in unemployment and (paradoxically) high, policy-induced inflation.
- The administration will struggle to tackle high levels of poverty and the country's ethnic and religious divisions. This potent mixture has the potential to cause protests that could halt the advancement of pro-market reforms.
- A decline in living standards under Mr Buhari, whose tenure has been marked by two recessions, as well as frustrations over rising insecurity and poor governance, means that the opposition, the People's Democratic Party (PDP), is forecast to win the 2023 election.
- Efforts to improve the business environment will continue to be hindered by the slow pace of market-oriented structural reforms, the ongoing problem of corruption, the absence of effective government institutions, poor infrastructure and the weak capacity of the civil service to implement changes.
- The Economist Intelligence Unit expects some reregulation of electricity pricing under a PDP government. This would be bad news for the power sector, but we do not expect a return to distortive pricing in the petroleum sector.
- Still-weak revenue inflows in 2021 will coincide with large recurrent government spending commitments and result in another substantial fiscal deficit (by Nigerian standards). The budget shortfall will then broadly narrow as external conditions improve, the domestic economy picks up and revenue rises.
- Given a crippling infrastructure deficit, high inflation, instability in crucial agricultural regions and high unemployment, we expect real GDP growth of just 1.2% in 2021. Only when the exchange rate and inflation stabilise will there be a more meaningful recovery.
- Inflation will stay high in 2021 as devaluation of the naira, price deregulation, instability in agricultural growing areas, monetary loosening and exchange-rate restrictions for staple imports feed into consumer prices. Monetary tightening is expected to start from 2022 to tackle the issue.
- We expect a current-account deficit for a third consecutive year in 2021 (something that has not been seen since the 1990s) despite a substantial rebound in oil prices. The current account will return to surplus in 2022-25 as the oil market recovers and petrol import volumes decline.

- Nigeria's business environment score worsens slightly for the forecast period (2021-25) as the macroeconomic and security environment remains highly challenging. As a result, its global and regional rankings fall.

Country forecast overview: Nigeria's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: The overarching policy objective is to promote self-sufficiency and local industrialisation through protectionism. As a result, the non-oil sector will be largely shielded from external competition.
2023-25: A new government (which is likely to be opposition-led) is likely to remain wary of opening up the economy.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Royalties for offshore oil activity that were introduced in 2020 are reduced in an attempt to prevent divestment from oil majors operating in Nigeria. Outside the oil sector, concerns over the foreign-exchange regime deter investment.
2023-25: Energy firms remain hesitant about increasing their presence in a difficult operating environment, especially onshore, but concerted efforts are made to clean up the national oil company (which is in joint venture with oil majors).
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Movement of goods is highly regulated to prevent smuggling, but people will be allowed to cross land borders once the coronavirus pandemic is brought under control.
2023-25: A spread between the official and the parallel-market exchange rates persists as oil prices rise and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is again able to defend an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxes 2021-22: The focus on boosting tax compliance intensifies, but the weak state of the economy and upcoming elections prevent tax increases.
2023-25: Value-added tax (VAT) is raised from 7.5% to cut the budget deficit amid persistently high debt-servicing costs.
Financing 2021-22: The government returns to the sovereign debt market, and capital projects are restarted.
2023-25: Credit conditions become tighter as the CBN moves to control high inflation.
The labour market 2021-22: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers, restrictive visa regulations and poor health indicators.
2023-25: Employers continue to struggle to find qualified staff; unemployment stays high and the labour market loose.
Infrastructure 2021-22: A reduction in consumer subsidies (for petrol) frees up resources for higher public capital investment, but government spending remains small relative to the size of the economy, at less than 7%.
2023-25: A large private refinery starts up, reducing Nigeria's near-total dependency on imported petrol.
Technological readiness 2021-22: Nigeria retains a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2023-25: Research spending remains low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960, and multi-party democracy was restored in 1999 after a protracted period of military rule. The first two presidential elections (in 1999 and 2003) were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. In 2015 Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari, who secured a second term in early 2019.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties predominate. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the predominant political force, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015 and secure re-election in 2019.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. The government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is a contentious issue, with important subsidy programmes hinging on an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take small as a share of GDP. With oil prices far lower than they were in 2010-14, it is likely that amendments to consumer taxes will be made, specifically in value-added tax (VAT, currently 7.5%).
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the president, Muhammadu Buhari, to stay in power until his second (and final) term expires in 2023. He will be under immense pressure to stabilise Nigeria, but myriad security threats will prove unmanageable. The military and police are overstretched and unable to tackle simultaneous security crises. Emergencies will be triaged, with military resources deployed to whichever is considered the most pressing.
This shaky system will keep the government in power but leave the country highly dysfunctional and, in many regions, extremely insecure. The government will remain embroiled in a drawn-out conflict with two Islamist terrorist groups, Boko Haram and Islamic State of West Africa Province. In recent years both groups have been confined mainly to north-eastern Nigeria, but there have been recent reports that Boko Haram has expanded into central Nigeria, sparking concerns about potential insecurity close to the capital, Abuja. Although this agricultural "Middle Belt" has been affected by violent conflict between farmers and herdsmen over increasingly scarce land and water resources, it is relatively new territory for Boko Haram. Security challenges will also increase in other areas of the country, with unrest in the south-east attributed to Biafran secessionist groups and a broader surge in kidnappings by established groups such as Boko Haram and by organised criminal networks.
The security forces will attempt to address all these threats, but with resources increasingly stretched, the security situation will remain extremely volatile. The north-east-particularly Borno state-will remain a low-level conflict zone, and banditry and kidnapping will remain pervasive. Over 2021-25 other areas of the country could begin to resemble the highly insecure north-east as, in essence, "no-go" zones. Broader problems such police corruption and judicial impunity will remain unaddressed and compound the precarious security situation.
Nigeria's federal government has weathered severe but localised (largely rural) security problems for several decades without overall stability being jeopardised. However, the near- to medium-term outlook is made more uncertain by the scars of recession in 2020 and by rising unemployment (which reached 33% in the fourth quarter of 2020, one of the highest levels in the world) and poverty. Declining living standards arguably exacerbated and prolonged the protests over police brutality that broke out in cities across southern Nigeria in October 2020. The risk of fresh bouts of violent protest will be elevated in the near term given growing security problems and the still-weak economy. We currently do not expect this to jeopardise Mr Buhari's leadership; there have been sporadic rumours that elements of the military may be plotting a coup, but the president appears to retain solid support from the army. A more likely scenario is that violent bouts of protest will force concessions from the government, potentially placing some of its pro-market reform agenda on hold in order to extend price controls and increase subsidisation on utility rates.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch The next national elections are due in 2023. In the most recent presidential election, in 2019, the candidates of both main parties were from the north, and custom dictates that the candidates in 2023 will be from the south. This should lead to an improvement on the abysmally low turnout in 2019 in the south, which is a stronghold of the main opposition party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP). Frustration with high prices, declining living standards and perpetual instability will be directed at the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress, giving the PDP a winning edge.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations Nigeria will remain a major player in Africa, given its size, but its domestic challenges tend to keep policymakers inwardly focused. Land borders that were closed to goods since late 2019 have reopened, but recent instability in Chad has meant increased restrictions, with only Nigerians allowed to enter the country from Chad. Nigeria's approach to encouraging regional trade will be minimalist, beyond its obligations under the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCTFA). The trade pact compels Nigeria to eliminate 97% of tariff lines over the next five to ten years. This deadline will not be met early, given high prices in Nigeria and declining external competitiveness for industries that could otherwise benefit from regional market access.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends Nigeria's government and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will aggressively promote local industry, but some elements of policy are contradictory and will contribute to macroeconomic imbalances. An important theme for inward investment will be management of the naira. A ban on foreign-exchange access for imports of certain manufactures and agricultural goods (covering 47 items) is being enforced to protect local industry and support the currency, but has some major flaws. Most notably, restrictions are elevating inflation and undermining the currency regime through sustained real effective exchange-rate (REER) appreciation. Despite this, currency restrictions are expected to last throughout the forecast period, being central to the CBN's economic development strategy.
The government has announced that henceforth it will conduct official foreign-exchange transactions using the Nigerian autonomous foreign-exchange fixing (NAFEX) rate, which was previously used only by exporters and investors. This is tantamount to devaluation and has been touted by officials as the adoption of a "market-determined" currency. However, a wide spread between the NAFEX and parallel-market rates confirms overvaluation of the former, and the CBN continues to insist that the structure of the foreign-exchange market is unaltered. The adoption of a fully market-determined currency is not expected in 2021-25, with the CBN adamant that such a move would lead to an overshoot and an inflationary spiral.
Faced with hard-currency shortages in 2020, the CBN has allowed a backlog of foreign-exchange orders from investors and importers to accumulate. Market turnover has broadly increased in 2021, but the backlog will only be cleared slowly to modulate capital outflows, further undermining the currency regime's reputation. A pattern of inflexibility by the CBN in the wake of oil price shocks (with similarly severe foreign-exchange shortages in 2015-16) will have a long-term impact on confidence, and partly explains our projection that foreign direct investment (FDI) will equal 1% of GDP or less throughout 2021-25.
Over time the contradiction between protectionism and the AfCFTA's principles will grow increasingly conspicuous, but we do not expect an immediate change in strategy given that non-tariff barriers will be phased out over several years. Developing manufacturing and agriculture is likely to be viewed as a means of preparing for the eventual elimination of tariffs, with currency controls expected to play a role in hastening the process. However, an infrastructure deficit, REER appreciation and instability in agricultural heartlands mean that Nigeria will struggle to acquire new comparative advantages in 2021-25, leaving the fiscal and external accounts and the naira exposed to oil price swings.
Price controls will be another important area of economic policy. Astonishing strides towards the deregulation of petrol and electricity pricing were made in 2020, but the goal of reaching market prices has already been scaled back, in the face of political pressure and now that crude oil prices are rising. A permanent reinstatement of petrol price controls is made unlikely by a new Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) that we expect to be passed later in 2021. The legislation is likely to streamline sector-wide regulation in the process of creating a new, profit-oriented national oil company, which by definition could not be weighed down by subsidising the retail market. The downstream industry should become commercially viable from this reorganisation of the sector, allowing Nigeria to wean itself off petrol imports, with a new 650,000-barrel/day refinery expected to come on stream in 2022. The PIB will also encourage upstream oil investment by making fiscal terms clearer for multinationals. However, we do not expect the sustained electricity price increases that are needed for the power sector to become financially sound, and pricing in the sector remains regulated de jure. Electricity undersupply will therefore continue to hinder industrialisation.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy We expect that the public finances will stay in deficit in 2021-25, but that the shortfall will ease over the forecast period. Crude oil receipts make up more than 50% of the federal government's retained income, and an average global oil price of US$63.8/barrel in 2021-25 will be insufficient to balance the budget.
The federal government's tax take is among the world's lowest given widespread evasion and a large informal sector. The authorities view value-added tax (VAT, currently at 7.5%) as the most effective means of increasing fiscal receipts, and we expect three equal VAT rate increases, taking the rate to 15% by 2025. The first is expected in 2022, prior to the next elections but seemingly inevitable given a rising debt burden, with further rises in 2024 and 2025. Even then, we expect fiscal revenue to peak at just 4.4% of GDP in 2024, which also assumes a lack of fuel subsidies (costs for which are deducted from revenue) after 2021. Set against this, high debt-servicing costs, a large public wage bill and healthcare commitments, including purchase of coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccines, will elevate expenditure. Capital investment will be emphasised to compensate for the ending of petrol subsidies once the PIB is enacted (which is expected in late 2021). The government justified price deregulation by promising to invest the savings in infrastructure and will face pressure to match rhetoric with action.
We expect the fiscal deficit to decline to 3.3% of GDP in 2021 (from 3.7% of GDP in 2020) as international oil prices rise. VAT increases will lead the ratio to fall to 2.3% of GDP in 2024, but a decline in average global oil prices in 2025 will cause the shortfall to widen to 2.5% of GDP in 2025. The government has raised its public debt limit to 40% of GDP to incorporate higher budget shortfalls over the medium term and to accommodate securitisation of CBN deficit financing as long-term debt. We expect the ratio to reach only 31% of GDP in 2025.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy The CBN will fail to keep inflation below a target ceiling of 9%, and its policy decisions are likely to remain erratic. After a cumulative increase of 100 basis points in May and September 2020, the policy interest rate has been kept at 11.5% despite an upward trend in annual inflation (which reached 18.2% in March). The current strategy is to boost the supply side of the economy and thereby control inflation. We believe this is misguided; high and rising inflation will frustrate an economic recovery, and issues such as inadequate public infrastructure, direct funding of the fiscal deficit, hard-currency shortages and rampant instability need to be addressed before the supply side can moderate the price level. We expect high inflation to persist, compelling the CBN to raise interest rates in 2022, despite still-weak economic growth. There is a distinct possibility that the CBN may tighten earlier, given escalating inflation. Easing will resume only in 2024, when inflation has fallen appreciably.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth The economy is expected to exit recession in 2021 as the impact of lockdown in 2020 fades, but high inflation will impede improvements in business sentiment and dampen real purchasing power amid high unemployment (at more than one-third of the labour force) and low wage growth. Fiscal stimulus will be an inadequate counterforce, given budget constraints, and loose monetary policy will put pressure on the naira, creating foreign-exchange scarcity and further undermining macroeconomic stability. Oil export volumes will rise slightly, however, as quotas agreed by OPEC+ (comprising OPEC and a group of non-OPEC countries) are relaxed, contributing to real GDP growth of 1.2% in 2021.
The CBN is expected to tighten monetary policy from 2022, circumscribing the nascent economic recovery, but the exchange rate should stabilise and cause inflation to ease, allowing stronger growth. As non-business financial penetration is low, private consumption will recover in the second half of 2021-25 alongside disinflation even as interest rates rise. New refining capacity is expected to come on stream in earnest, boosting net exports (with some output for the regional market, and Nigeria's import dependency for fuel falling). Crude oil exports are also expected to grow as prices rise. As refinery output continues to ramp up, inflation falls and real spending power recovers, growth will pick up to an annual average of 4% in 2023-24. However, these rates of growth are well below potential. The economy will continue to lack dynamism given high interest rates, low FDI, high unemployment, pervasive instability in agricultural regions and infrastructure deficiencies, particularly regarding stable power supply. A more challenging year is forecast for 2025 as oil prices fall and macroeconomic uncertainty rises, with growth slipping to 1.9%.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation We expect inflation to average 17% in 2021, with increases on both core and non-core levels. High inflation will stem from past increases in petrol prices and the lingering pass-through of raised electricity tariffs in 2020, foreign-exchange restrictions on various imported goods, including staple foods, and devaluation of the naira. Assuming that the exchange rate stabilises and the CBN tightens monetary policy, we expect the annual inflation rate to begin to fall from 2022, to an average of 10% in 2024. Foreign-exchange controls on imported goods, conflict in the Middle Belt-Nigeria's breadbasket-and an eventual return to pricing petrol at the market rate will prevent a faster fall. Currency devaluation in 2025 will cause the average rate to increase again, to 12.5% that year.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates Nigeria's government has declared that official transactions have shifted from the CBN rate (N379:US$1) to the NAFEX rate (N412:US$1 in late April), in essence consolidating the two via devaluation and in effect making the official rate obsolete. The NAFEX rate-which was established in 2017-is more flexible than the official rate but is nonetheless tightly managed by the CBN and overvalued, as demonstrated by a parallel rate of N485:US$1.
Foreign reserves are again declining after a brief rise in early April and the CBN is yet to clear a backlog of hard-currency orders, indicating that the drawdown is partly being caused by a net outflow on current transactions, despite firmer oil prices. REER appreciation is a leading factor behind the external imbalance, and in the CBN's defence of reserves, we expect the naira to end 2021 at N422:US$1. Following this we expect the current account to return to surplus in 2022-25 while monetary tightening in Nigeria attracts hot-money inflows. This should allow the CBN to keep the exchange rate broadly stable. Unceasing currency misalignment means that REER appreciation will nonetheless resurface and, with oil prices expected to slide again in 2025, another devaluation is expected in that year, to N485:US$1.
Forecasting the naira The Economist Intelligence Unit began forecasting the Nigerian autonomous foreign-exchange fixing (NAFEX)rate from March 2021, following the government's adoption of that rate for official transactions. In the interest of continuity, data in previous periods will be for the official exchange rate before its merger with the NAFEX rate.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector Assuming that devaluation moderates import demand for goods and services, and with global crude prices rising and inward transfers increasing as the global economy returns to growth, we expect a current-account deficit equal to 0.9% of GDP in 2021, down from 3.9% of GDP in 2020. Over the remainder of the forecast period we expect a small current-account surplus. Oil prices are projected to remain relatively high in 2022-23, supporting exports. Lower petroleum import volumes as new domestic refinery capacity comes on stream will constrain growth in the import bill (which is otherwise driven by real naira appreciation). Remittances from the large Nigerian diaspora should also recover to pre-pandemic levels. This will all contribute to an annual average current-account surplus of 1.7% of GDP in 2022-24. The surplus will then narrow to 1.2% of GDP in 2025 as falling oil prices push down export earnings. The deficit in 2021 will be financed largely by debt, with investment inflows limited by a dysfunctional foreign-exchange market.

Full text: - The president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is facing a challenging period for the remainder of his term, which ends in 2024. This includes a possible challenge for the leadership of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) in December 2022 in the absence of an economic rebound.
- As South Africa emerges from the global coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the economic damage, alongside the need for urgent action, will help to build support within the ANC for the president's reformist agenda, albeit reluctantly in some cases. The fightback against corruption is also gaining momentum, and The Economist Intelligence Unit expects significant developments in 2021.
- A post-pandemic recovery plan will focus on a vaccination rollout, infrastructure investment (led by the private sector), a mass public works programme to create jobs and combating electricity shortages. Fiscal constraints point to an increased reliance on public-private partnerships to drive forward key projects.
- We expect a modest recovery to growth of 2% in 2021. Power supply constraints, still-weak tourism and jobs lost to the pandemic will preclude a more rapid rebound, despite low interest rates. We envisage growth quickening to an average of 2.7% a year in 2022-25, underpinned by structural reforms, but unemployment will continue to weigh on aggregate demand.
- The budget deficit soared to 14% of GDP in fiscal year 2020/21 (April-March), but will trend lower, helped by wage restraint and revenue gains from higher commodity prices. Cumulative interest-rate cuts in 2020 reduced the benchmark rate to 3.5%, providing relief to borrowers, but another reduction is unlikely. We expect interest rates to remain on hold until a small rise in late 2021 or early 2022.
- After easing to a multi-year low of 3.2% in 2020, average inflation will rise to 3.7% in 2021, owing to costlier oil and electricity, but weak demand will keep price growth subdued. Inflation will quicken to 4.6% a year on average in 2022-25 as economic growth stages a gradual post-pandemic recovery.
- South Africa recorded a rare current-account surplus in 2020, of 2.2% of GDP, as exports fell more slowly than imports, pushing up the merchandise trade surplus. We expect the return of a current-account deficit in 2021-25 as imports recover and the deficit on invisible trade (services, income and current transfers) widens.

Country forecast overview: South Africa's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: A post-pandemic investment drive, focused on infrastructure, facilitates public-private partnerships. Challenges include tighter competition laws and stricter black economic empowerment (BEE) rules.
2023-25: Expropriation without compensation, to speed up land reform, applies in limited circumstances only, reducing the threat to property rights. Investment incentives in selected industries (such as automotive manufacturing) remain in place.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: A reworked mining charter offers some concessions to business. A new foreign investment law limits access to international arbitration by giving local courts the primary responsibility for handling disputes.
2023-25: The government continues to encourage foreign investment and public-private partnerships, but resists the full privatisation of state assets in most cases.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: The government implements a further relaxation of capital controls on outward investment and other flows.
2023-25: Progress towards regional economic integration in Southern Africa makes some advances, but barriers persist.
Taxes 2021-22: Despite tough fiscal conditions, the government avoids major tax increases to shield households and firms.
2023-25: Efforts to streamline and modernise the tax system and expand the tax base continue.
Financing 2021-22: Cuts in the benchmark interest rate and other liquidity-boosting measures help to support banks and firms during the pandemic. Local banks remain sound and a major source of corporate financing, despite profits being squeezed.
2023-25: The continued independence of the South African Reserve Bank (the central bank) helps to preserve financial system stability. Monetary policy remains prudent and interest rates edge higher. The proposed nationalisation of the central bank is symbolic.
The labour market 2021-22: Pandemic-induced job losses oblige trade unions to accept a mild relaxation of currently inflexible labour laws.
2023-25: The labour market remains tough, owing to skills shortages and BEE targets.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Investment in transport and electricity, led in many cases by private firms, boosts capacity.
2023-25: Private-sector-led investment in renewable energy gathers momentum under the government's long-term energy plan, adding diversity to power supplies and cutting reliance on coal. Rising power tariffs drive energy efficiency.
Technological readiness 2021-22: The rollout of domestic fibre-optic cables boosts capacity and cuts costs. Investment in digital technology gathers momentum, including in cloud computing and high-end data analysis. The allocation of new spectrum boosts capacity
2023-25: Work advances on the Square Kilometre Array-a powerful radio telescope with multinational support-giving a wider boost to science and to information and communications technology.

Background: South Africa became a full democracy in 1994, when it first held all-race elections. The African National Congress (ANC) won, and has dominated all subsequent elections-in 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019. However, support ebbed steadily from a peak of nearly 70% in 2004, to 62.1% in 2014 and 57.5% in May 2019. The ANC feared a worse result in May 2019, but the installation of Cyril Ramaphosa as president in February 2018, replacing the scandal-tainted Jacob Zuma, provided a mild bounce. Mr Ramaphosa will now serve a full five-year term and will be eligible for a second term.
Political structure: South Africa is a constitutional democracy with a bicameral parliament and a president elected by parliament. The constitution is the supreme law. The National Assembly is elected by proportional representation; the National Council of the Provinces consists of indirectly elected representatives of the nine provinces. The judiciary is independent and includes an 11-member Constitutional Court. The constitution provides for an independent corruption watchdog-the Public Protector-and commissions on human rights, gender equality and restitution of land rights.
Policy issues: The main policy focus in 2021-25 will be to facilitate recovery from a severe recession in 2020, caused by the damaging impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The need to boost post-pandemic growth will allow Mr Ramaphosa to push ahead more forcefully with his reformist agenda. A new economic recovery and reconstruction plan, released in October after consultation with business and labour unions, will focus on investment in critical infrastructure (such as housing and transport), led by the private sector, alongside a large-scale public works programme to create jobs. Tackling power shortages by commissioning new capacity from independent power producers, and by restructuring Eskom, the highly-indebted electricity parastatal, is another key objective. Fiscal constraints point to an increased reliance on public-private partnerships, despite resistance from vested interests. A new draft expropriation bill in October sets clear limits on when compensation is not payable, thus diminishing the threat to property rights and investor confidence. Challenges include skills shortages, stricter competition laws and the perennial risk of strikes.
Taxation: Value-added tax (VAT) is levied at a flat rate of 15%-after a rise from 14% on April 1st 2018-although some essentials are zero-rated. Corporation tax (of 28%), income tax and VAT were left unchanged in the 2020/21 budget. Some tax concessions are available, including in special economic zones.
Foreign trade: South Africa has a relatively open economy, with foreign trade (imports plus exports) accounting for about 52% of GDP. China, the EU, the US and Japan are among its largest trading partners. Trade with the rest of Africa has become progressively more important, and it is the only region with which South Africa has a trade surplus.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability Recovery from the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic will confront South Africa with unparalleled challenges, but the growing authority of the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has positive implications for political stability and economic reform. Politics in 2021 will be influenced by the ongoing pandemic. Recent developments are encouraging: new cases and deaths fell to 5,518 and 280, respectively, in the week-ending April 9th-the lowest for almost a year. After a slow start, current plans are for vaccination rollout to gain momentum in May and June, before a more widespread inoculation programme in July-December. Given a range of global bottlenecks in the vaccine production supply chain that have left several countries short of contracted volumes, the slow initial pace of vaccination raises the risk of a third wave during the southern hemisphere winter (June-August), which could stifle the economic recovery and increase social unrest.
Since being elected for a five-year term in May 2019 Mr Ramaphosa has struggled to unite the disparate factions of the ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC), behind a reformist agenda, but a severe recession in 2020, accompanied by heavy job losses and rising poverty, is changing the political dynamic. After several years of policy fudges to appease powerful interest groups (such as labour unions), the urgent need for action to repair the economy-and working more closely with the private sector-is boosting the president's influence and sidelining his critics.
The two main sources of resistance to Mr Ramaphosa within the ANC will be left-wing interventionists, including labour unions-which will remain wedded to a strong state role in the economy-and the so-called radical transformation movement that emerged during the presidency of Jacob Zuma (2009-18), which is blamed for facilitating corruption and patronage under the guise of black economic empowerment. The left, although still clamouring for wage rises, is now resigned to a more prominent role for the private sector and the restructuring of dysfunctional parastatal firms, in view of the state's financial and technical capacity constraints. Heavy job losses will inevitably weaken trade unions' influence in both the private and the public sectors, obliging them to compromise in many cases. The president's economic recovery package, devised with business and labour input, combines an infrastructure investment plan-to be led by the private sector-with a major job-creating public works programme to provide temporary relief to the unemployed.
Resistance from the radical transformation faction will fade, given an escalating crackdown on corruption and the rising prospect of Mr Zuma being convicted on graft charges dating from before his presidency: a full trial will start in May. Mr Zuma could also be jailed for defying a Constitutional Court order to appear before a judge-led corruption inquiry in February. A pending corruption trial facing the ANC's secretary-general, Ace Magashule-one of Mr Zuma's allies-now scheduled for August, will further weaken the radical transformation faction, especially if Mr Magashule is suspended from his post in line with party policy. A conviction in 2021 for Mr Zuma, who presided over institutional weakening during his tenure, would symbolise a fightback against impunity.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch The next major political event is the ANC's five-yearly National General Council (NGC)-a policy implementation review-which will give a clearer indication of the balance of forces in the party and the extent of Mr Ramaphosa's control. After being delayed by more than a year by the pandemic, the NGC's timing is still uncertain, although we expect it to take place in advance of the next municipal elections, which are scheduled to be held during an August-October 2021 window. The nationwide ballot will give voters the first chance to judge the government's pandemic response and will be a test of Mr Ramaphosa's and the ANC's popularity. A vote share for the ANC in 2021 of less than the 57.5% won in 2019 would be a setback for Mr Ramaphosa, heralding a potential challenge by radical forces for the ANC leadership in December 2022; a share above 57.5% would help to cement the president's position. We expect the ANC, under Mr Ramaphosa, to retain power at the next general election (in 2024), but with reduced electoral support. The phased implementation of a new Political Party Funding Act from April 2021 will strengthen transparency.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations South Africa-the most advanced economy in Africa and a major business hub-will remain deeply engaged in the continent, particularly in Southern and East Africa. Despite a challenging environment, South Africa will continue to attract international companies, including from the US, Europe and Asia, owing to strong institutions, sound banks and its role as continental gateway. South Africa's commercial involvement in other African markets will remain broad-based, covering mining, banking, telecommunications, retail and hospitality. The pandemic is causing temporary disruption to regional relations because of border closures and flight bans, aggravated by a second wave of infections, but regional access for South Africa-based firms will improve in 2021, helped by vaccine rollouts.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends The most immediate policy challenges facing the government are to revive the economy caused by the pandemic's impact on activity and health. Containment measures have been alternatively tightened and loosened since the pandemic erupted-with the last move, to level one, the most relaxed, taking place on March 1st-but the cost of the pandemic in terms of lost jobs and income remains heavy. A second wave of infections, driven by a new, more transmissible variant of the virus, led to more cases and deaths in December/January than during the first peak in July/August 2020, but the figures have continued trending lower in recent weeks. A vaccine rollout will gather pace during the second quarter of 2021, but widespread immunisation is unlikely in South Africa until July-December, given supply shortages and logistical challenges, which increases the risk of a third wave of Covid-19.
The government will attempt to engineer a rebound in growth in 2021-25, via targeted measures and deeper structural reforms, although the scope for additional monetary and fiscal intervention is limited. With the benchmark interest rate at a record low of 3.5%, there is little room for further cuts, and several years of heavy spending and rising budget deficits preclude a broad-based fiscal stimulus. Even before the pandemic South Africa was trapped in a low-growth trajectory, not for the want of pro-growth plans, but because of policy fudges between left-wing and pro-business factions and weak implementation. The pandemic, by exposing underlying weaknesses (such as widespread poverty and inequality) and by highlighting the need for urgent action, should be a catalyst for deeper and more rapid structural reforms, including a greater role for the private sector.
Devised in consultation with business and organised labour, an economic recovery and reconstruction plan will focus on job creation-via large-scale public works programmes-and infrastructure investment. The plan aims to channel R100bn (US$6.8bn) over ten years into an infrastructure fund with the aim of attracting a ten times greater sum from the private sector via public-private partnerships. Projects already identified include housing and network infrastructure. Restoring energy security by adding new capacity (mostly solar and wind) from independent power producers is a key target, as is the planned auction of new broadband spectrum in 2021, which will boost communication and digitisation. Restructuring dysfunctional parastatal firms is another central priority. Implementation remains a challenge, but the political will to act is now stronger. Commitments to the IMF in return for a rapid financing instrument (RFI) in July 2020 will add impetus to reforms in the face of resistance from vested interests. We expect economic policy to support medium-term growth momentum and help the country to emerge from secular stagnation.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy Further pandemic-related fiscal support in 2021 will be needed, but fiscal consolidation will eventually need to take priority in the medium term. We expect the fiscal deficit for 2020/21 (April-March) to hit a record 14% of GDP, although this is lower than the 15.7% of GDP shortfall predicted in last October's medium-term budget policy statement, helped by a revenue boost from a recent commodity price upswing. The planned tax hikes in 2021/22 are now on hold and a vaccine rollout costing an initial R9bn (US$620m) over two years is fully funded. The combination of stronger revenue-aided by an overhaul of the South African Revenue Service-alongside spending curbs, especially on public-sector wages, will see the deficit shrink during the forecast period. We expect the shortfall as a percentage of GDP to ebb to 9.2% in 2021/22 and 7.4% in 2022/23, before easing to 3.4% in 2025/26. The biggest risk to fiscal consolidation is a fightback by labour unions against wage restraint via a combination of legal action, political pressure and possible strikes.
After surging to 80% in 2020/21, owing to pandemic-related support measures, currency depreciation and recession, the public debt/GDP ratio will rise more slowly, as fiscal revenue recovers, peaking at 88.9% of GDP in 2025/26. Speedier fiscal consolidation reduces South Africa's risk of debt distress, as does its heavy reliance on deep and liquid domestic capital markets to finance most of the budget shortfalls, but debt-servicing costs will continue rising, and there is limited scope for slippage on both the spending and the revenue fronts. A failure to meet debt targets could oblige South Africa to undertake a formal IMF programme with strict conditions attached.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy Policy accommodation during the 2020 pandemic crisis will give way to a normalisation process later in 2021, with interest rates edging higher as the economy begins to recover. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB, the central bank) cut the benchmark interest rate (repo rate) five times in 2020-most recently in July-by a cumulative 300 basis points to 3.5%, to help to shield the economy from the pandemic. However, the rate has since remained on hold, reflecting limited scope for additional loosening. We expect the SARB to maintain its current stance throughout most of 2021, but the expected resumption of real GDP growth and a mild inflation upswing point to a small rate rise in either late 2021 or early 2022. Additional small increases will follow in 2023-25, broadly tracking US trends.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth Following a contraction of 7% in 2020, we expect real GDP to grow by 2% in 2021. The near-term recovery will depend on three main factors: control of the pandemic; the extent of fiscal and monetary policy support; and the pace of the national vaccine rollout, which so far has been slow to take off. A vaccination programme will support economic activity and confidence in the second quarter, but the rollout will be slow initially, before gathering pace in July-December, which leaves the possible risk of a third wave of infection during the southern hemisphere winter (June-August). The phased reopening of borders will provide some impetus, but pandemic risks will keep international tourism and the hospitality sector in the doldrums. Other factors curbing annual growth are a probable year-on-year contraction in real GDP in January-March, because of the pre-pandemic baseline, and elevated strike risks because of a public-sector pay freeze.
Prospects for 2022 are slightly brighter; we expect growth to quicken to 2.2%, helped by a relaxation of power-supply constraints and by stronger private investment in response to favourable policy initiatives, such as moves to facilitate public-private partnerships. We expect more frequent and heavier load-shedding (power rationing) to persist ahead of the planned commissioning of new generating capacity in mid-2022. Factors weighing on domestic growth will include a slowdown in global growth (after an initial rebound in 2021), alongside still-fragile tourism and elevated unemployment, which will sap aggregate demand. We expect growth to strengthen to 2.9% a year on average in 2023-25, underpinned by long-delayed reforms (such as parastatal restructuring) and the spread of digital technology, but the global backdrop will remain subdued in terms of economic growth and trade flows.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation After dipping to a multi-year low of 3.2% in 2020, owing to recession, cheaper imported oil and a bumper food harvest, inflation will edge up to 3.7% in 2021, but will remain comfortably within the SARB's 3-6% target range. The primary sources of inflation in 2021 will be higher oil prices and costlier electricity tariffs, although the prospect of a second consecutive bumper harvest in the 2020/21 season will offset higher global food prices. Other factors curbing inflation are mild rand appreciation in 2021, weak aggregate demand (owing to unemployment and income losses), spare industrial capacity and strong retail competition. We expect inflation to quicken to an average of 4.6% a year in 2022-25, spurred by a modest revival in GDP growth, but the level will stay within the SARB's target range, temporary breaches aside.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates Stronger commodity prices and global liquidity injections will support the rand in 2021, as shown by a 10% year-on-year appreciation of the local unit to R14.99:US$1 in March. Being commodity-dependent, widely traded and an emerging-market proxy, the rand will benefit from a positive global backdrop, but remains vulnerable to any adverse shifts in global sentiment and to negative domestic developments. We see the rand weakening from current levels, in view of South Africa's large fiscal deficit and sluggish growth outlook-alongside potential global tensions-to end 2021 at R16.61:US$1. On an annual average basis, we predict strengthening to R15.77:US$1 in 2021 (revised from R16.53:US$1) as markets normalise after disruption in 2020. The rand will remain volatile, often experiencing large daily movements in response to shifting sentiment, although South Africa's modest external debt stock and healthy foreign-exchange reserves are protective. Our forecast assumes gradual depreciation from 2022 onwards, with the rand weakening to R18.62:US$1 in 2025, although the pace of decline will be close to the inflation rate, implying a relatively stable REER.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector Following a tumultuous 2020, we still consider that the main risks to the economy in 2021 are domestic, rather than external. Notwithstanding lingering uncertainty surrounding global trade, stemming from countries' ability to emerge from coronavirus-related containment measures, trade prospects will be particularly favourable. On balance, however, we expect the trade surplus (which reached record highs in 2020) to shrink in 2021-25. The gradual recovery in total consumption and investment, combined with stronger oil prices, will increase imports, causing the current account to shift back into deficit in 2021, following a temporary shift into surplus in 2020 amid the pandemic. Although robust demand and prices for gold and platinum-group metals and China's return to near-normality will support exports, a continued narrowing of the trade surplus (together with a widening primary income deficit as a result of rising external debt-service obligations and a pick-up in profit repatriation abroad) will sustain a current-account deficit over the forecast period.
Foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio inflows will be slow to recover in 2021, but will pick up in 2022-25. The recovery will be supported by renewed investment in infrastructure and privatisation of state assets. We expect net inflows of US$5.2bn a year on average (just under 10% of gross financing needs). South Africa will remain a key base for multinational companies with pan-African operations by offering a range of services, including banking, capital-raising and trade-related functions

Full text: - The populist, right-wing government of the president, Jair Bolsonaro, lacks a majority in Brazil's highly fragmented Congress but has reached out to centrist parties to bolster governability amid impeachment risks. Tensions with the judiciary will persist while the authorities investigate the affairs of the president and his sons. There are internal tensions in the government resulting from a power struggle between various wings: an ideological wing; retired military officials in the cabinet (including the vice-president); and the free-market economy minister and members of centrist parties (which have three cabinet posts). The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that negotiations with Congress will be challenging-especially with the president's popularity under increasing pressure-but that they will advance where there is common ground with centrist parties.

- Brazil remains in the lower half of the global ranking in the 2021-25 forecast period, but improvements have lifted its regional and global positions by one place. Economic crisis management pushed back reforms in 2020, and there is now only a narrow window before Brazil gears up for the 2022 general election. Several areas of the business environment-including foreign trade and exchange controls, and policy towards foreign investment and towards private enterprise-will improve, but only moderately. There will be improvements in the labour market and infrastructure, but these will remain weak areas of the investment climate. Assuming broad continuity under the next administration (from January 2023), there will be further piecemeal advances, but a shift to more statist policies is a risk.

Brazil--highlights: Economic outlook   2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025
Real GDP growth (%) -4.1 3.2 2.3 1.9 2.0 2.0
Consumer price inflation (av, %) 3.2 6.7 4.0 3.6 3.5 3.5

- After a 4.1% GDP contraction in 2020 and an expected renewed technical recession in first-half 2021 amid a resurgence in coronavirus (Covid-19) infections and mobility restrictions, GDP will recover with the rollout of vaccines. Our 2021 growth forecast of 3.2% reflects carryover effects from 2020, rather than sequential growth. GDP growth will average 2% in 2022-25. Fiscal, monetary and credit stimulus was hefty in 2020, leaving considerable consolidation challenges in the recovery period. The fiscal deficit reached almost 14% of GDP in 2020, lifting the public debt/GDP ratio to 90%. Assuming recovery and consolidation thereafter, we expect the public debt ratio to stabilise; otherwise, domestic debt sustainability issues will come to the fore, lifting interest rates and inflation.

Population growth   0.8 0.7
Working-age population growth   1.0 0.6
Labour force growth   0.8 0.4

- The population growth rate will fall to 0.7% in 2021-25. However, this is still above the world average and well above western European rates. The population will remain younger than in most industrialised countries, and the rise in the number of people of working age will outpace population growth as a whole. However, Brazil's demographic dynamics will deteriorate, which will heighten pressure on the pension system, despite the 2019 pension reform.

- Brazil is Latin America's largest market and has the fifth-largest population in the world. Although it has dropped out of the top ten largest economies, partly owing to a weaker currency, it will continue to offer big investment opportunities. Brazil faces a tepid recovery from the 2020 recession; growth prospects are modest amid rising fiscal constraints, and it will be difficult to replicate the gains achieved in the decade preceding the 2014-16 recession in terms of reducing income inequality (which reflected job creation in low-skilled sectors, minimum wage rises and a consumer credit boom). Deepening capital markets will boost credit availability for businesses during the recovery phase.

Brazil--highlights: Long-term outlook   2021-30 2031-50 2021-50
Growth and productivity (% change; annual av)
Growth of real GDP per head 1.4 1.7 1.6
Growth of real GDP 2.0 1.9 1.9
Labour productivity growth 0.9 2.0 1.6
From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.

- Our long-term growth forecast anticipates annual average GDP growth of 1.7% in 2021-50. Improvements in infrastructure and education, trade expansion, a broader presence of multinational business, and the development of huge oil reserves will mitigate slower labour force growth and will help to sustain labour productivity growth. If improvements in policymaking and the business environment were to exceed expectations, growth rates would be higher. For many years, performance will continue to fluctuate with commodity cycles, as agriculture and natural resource extraction will continue to play important roles in the economy. Climate change will crimp agricultural growth despite technological advances to make crops resistant to warmer temperatures.

Background: A new constitution was ratified in 1988 after more than 20 years of military rule. The government of Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995-2002) ended hyperinflation and advanced reforms to liberalise the economy. Under a former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-10), Brazil reaped the benefits of the reforms and enjoyed a consumer-led, commodities-fuelled boom. When this cycle ended, discontent with a weak economy, corruption and poor public services led to street protests. Lula's successor as president, Dilma Rousseff (2011-16), nonetheless won a second four-year term in 2014, but was impeached in 2016 over budget irregularities. Her vice-president, Michel Temer (2016-18), finished her term. Jair Bolsonaro won the October 2018 election and took office as president in January 2019.
Political structure: The president executes policy approved by the 513-seat Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and the 81-seat Senate (the upper house). Constitutional review is conducted by an independent judiciary. Although the president can resort to temporary decrees to push through legislation, the constitution gives Congress ample scope to check the executive. In the lower house, nearly 30 political parties are represented, and party discipline has traditionally been weak.
Policy issues: The benefits and entitlements established under the 1988 constitution have contributed to a doubling in central government primary spending, to over 28% of GDP. Congress approved a federal spending cap in 2016, a robust pension reform in October 2019 and central bank independence in March 2021. The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic led to expansionary fiscal, monetary and credit policies to offset the hit to the economy and financial system, lifting the public debt/GDP ratio to 90% in 2020. After cutting the Selic policy rate to 2% in August 2020, the Banco Central do Brasil (the central bank) began a partial front-loaded normalisation in March, lifting the rate by 75 basis points.
Taxation: Brazil has a poorly structured revenue system characterised by a heavy tax burden, a narrow tax base, complicated levies and widespread evasion. Both foreign and domestic companies employ tax professionals and devote considerable resources to managing their tax affairs. The corporate and indirect tax systems are particularly complex, porous and unwieldy; the income tax system is considered to be relatively efficient, with a top rate of 27.5%.
Foreign trade: The pandemic-induced recession and a weaker Real narrowed the current-account deficit to an 0.9% of GDP in 2020. Agricultural exports support a moderate structural trade surplus.

Political outlook: Political forces at a glance Brazil is a federal republic composed of 26 states and the capital district of Brasília, each with its own legislature and administration. Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right populist, took office as president in January 2019 for a four-year term after winning the October 2018 election. In November 2019 he left the right-wing Partido Social Liberal (PSL) and has not yet joined another party, although he may well do so before the next election, in 2022. For his first 18 months in office, Mr Bolsonaro governed without a multiparty coalition in Brazil's highly fragmented Congress-there are nearly 30 parties in the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house). As his position weakened and impeachment risks came to the fore in mid-2020, Mr Bolsonaro allied with a bloc of centrist parties (the centrão), which controls about 40% of the seats in the lower house, offering them government jobs overseeing large budgets and three cabinet posts (out of 22).
Next elections: Presidential, congressional and state elections (which are held every four years) are due in October 2022. Municipal elections took place in October 2020, and will next take place in 2024.

Political outlook: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the political environment in the near term to be shaped by the dynamics of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and vaccine rollout. Attention will subsequently turn to the October 2022 election campaigns, when Mr Bolsonaro will bid for re-election. Over 6% of the population have received at least one vaccine dose (above the Latin American average), but the "second wave" of the pandemic is worse than the first, with daily deaths exceeding 3,000 in late March and many hospitals lacking ICU capacity. A recent poll by Datafolha, a research institute, shows that 61% of voters disapprove of Mr Bolsonaro's handling of the pandemic-he has long been a virus denialist, flouted social distancing norms, criticised local governments for imposing mobility restrictions and, crucially, waited too long to purchase vaccines from overseas. He is therefore now fighting a rearguard action, promising to vaccinate all Brazilians by year-end.
The centrão is growing concerned about the political fallout from the handling of the pandemic, given that it is now in government with Mr Bolsonaro. Before the second wave of the pandemic, Mr Bolsonaro's position had in fact strengthened, following the election in February 2021 of his allies in the centrão to key leadership posts in both the upper and lower houses of Congress. The leader of the lower house, Arthur Lira of the Progressistas party, shelved opposition calls to open an impeachment trial against the president. This was previously a risk, owing to the president's confrontational attitude towards Congress and the Supreme Court in early 2020. Even so, to ensure governability by retaining the centrão's support, Mr Bolsonaro will need to grant party members political favours, including government posts and budget allocations. Provided Mr Bolsonaro also takes steps to improve his poor handling of the pandemic and vaccination advances, he should retain sufficient support from the centrão to retain his position. The creation of a national co-ordinating crisis committee at the behest of Mr Lira between the executive, congress and other stakeholders in late March is a positive step, but there is a high risk that it could break down, given Mr Bolsonaro's defiance over mobility restrictions taken by local governments.
Return of Lula will put Mr Bolsonaro's re-election bid under pressure The president is also under pressure following the re-emergence of a former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-10) of the Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT). A surprise Supreme Court ruling in March quashed Lula's 2017 corruption conviction, restoring his political rights. Although the anti-PT voter sentiment that swept Mr Bolsonaro to power in 2018 persists, Lula currently poses more of a challenge to Mr Bolsonaro's re-election ambitions than any other candidate, especially given a disunited centre. Although he will attempt to sway middle-ground voters (as well as legislators from the centrão, which formed part of his own government), Lula's return to politics reignites the left versus right-wing polarisation of recent years.
Mr Bolsonaro's proximity to the military (he is a retired army captain) has fuelled tensions, especially with the judiciary, as well as broader concerns over where his authoritarian streak could lead. We expect calm relations for now, but tensions could resurface, given the president's impetuousness and investigations into both him (relating to alleged political interference in the federal police in 2020) and his sons, Carlos (a local councillor, involved in "fake news" campaigns against political opponents) and Flávio (a senator, implicated in a local assembly graft scheme). Not only has the president put retired military officers in important cabinet positions (including Hamilton Mourão as vice-president), appointed them to run a third of Brazil's state-controlled companies and stacked lower-ranking officials in the state bureaucracy, but in early 2020 he actively supported bolsonaristas who attacked opponents in Congress (as well as in the judiciary and media) and called for military intervention. Tensions around election time are likely. However, a rupture of constitutional rule is unlikely, as voters would protest; polls suggest that 75% of Brazilians support democracy as the best form of government. In addition, most high-ranking, active military officials are reluctant to pander to Mr Bolsonaro's political ambitions and would not get involved if the president disputed the election results, for instance.
Political outlook: Political and institutional effectiveness Mr Bolsonaro faces governability problems similar to those that have plagued previous administrations. With nearly 30 parties represented, Congress is as unwieldy as ever; on top of this, Mr Bolsonaro faces challenges keeping together the disparate factions of his own political movement. This is composed of an ideological right-wing group revolving around the president and his three politically active sons; a military wing of mostly retired generals (including the vice-president, Mr Mourão, who plays a moderating role in national security and public affairs, although other members-such as Augusto Heleno, the intelligence chief-are more aligned with Mr Bolsonaro's confrontational rhetoric); and the team around the free-market economy minister, Paulo Guedes. In his first year, Mr Bolsonaro was reluctant to negotiate with the myriad parties in Congress as he continued his anti-establishment campaign rhetoric, criticising the "old-style politics" under which deals between Congress and the executive often involved patronage and "give and take" horse-trading, contributing to pervasive corruption. However, having been a legislator for nearly 30 years, the president knows how to appeal to lawmakers; he has a pragmatic side that has allowed him to curry favour at important times. For example, he was able to get a landmark pension reform passed in 2019, partly by offering legislators special budget allocations for pet projects in their constituencies-just the sort of pork-barrel politics that he used to criticise regularly. As his position weakened in 2020 and risks of a potential impeachment trial emerged, the president shifted to a more "politics as usual" approach, awarding roles in the cabinet and state agencies to members of centrist parties, allowing them to oversee huge budgets in return for support. Allied centrão figures won the leadership posts in the upper and lower houses of Congress in 2020, cementing Mr Bolsonaro's position with the bloc. The centrão now exerts more influence than before and has three cabinet members.
The coronavirus pandemic has brought to the fore strains between the branches of government at the federal, state and local levels. This is partly because of Mr Bolsonaro's negationist views about the severity of the virus and opposition to local governments' mobility restrictions. The country's large informal sector has complicated stay-at-home policies. To its advantage, Brazil's public hospital system is good by developing-country standards, and it has the resources and systems to make cash transfers to poor people. The government waited too long to purchase vaccines from global pharmaceutical companies when it had the opportunity to do so; combined with production bottlenecks, this is causing the vaccination programme to be slower than it could have been.
Political and institutional weakness persist Other than the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and vaccine rollout, politics continues to be shaped by developments going back to 2014 that highlighted political and institutional weaknesses. These include: a deep and wide-ranging corruption scandal centred on kickbacks at Petrobras (the state-controlled oil company) that emerged in the Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigations; the impeachment of a former president, Dilma Rousseff of the Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT); subsequent corruption investigations into Ms Rousseff's successor, Michel Temer (Movimento Democrático Brasileiro); and the corruption conviction of Lula. These developments eroded confidence in Brazil's political system and helped to catapult Mr Bolsonaro to the presidency in October 2018 on an anti-establishment, anti-corruption populist discourse. Many of these issues remain unresolved, and in the absence of political reform (to drastically reduce the number of parties represented in Congress), there is little prospect of a meaningful renewal. The decisive action taken during the Car Wash investigations and the independence of the judiciary appeared to be a sign that Brazil was beginning to tackle endemic corruption. However, confidence in legal stability and due process suffered a blow when the Supreme Court found that Sérgio Moro, the judge overseeing the most high-profile cases in the Car Wash investigations (which officially ended in early 2021), had not acted impartially and had liaised too closely with federal prosecutors to secure Lula's conviction. Although Lula could face a retrial (which in practice would take years), he has regained his political rights and is set to run for president in October 2022. Despite these setbacks to the Car Wash investigations in particular, prosecutors and the police will remain active more broadly in their efforts to combat corruption. Most large companies have strengthened their corporate governance mechanisms since the beginning of the Car Wash investigations, which is positive.
A major problem related to government effectiveness and corruption is the deep fragmentation of Congress, which encourages pork-barrel politics. Since democracy was restored to Brazil in 1985, governments have struggled to hold together multiparty coalitions. Low voter-registration thresholds have contributed to the large number of parties, and their leaders behave opportunistically. This dysfunctional system has become known as "presidential coalition" politics. Since 1985 two of the five directly elected presidents have been impeached by Congress-undermining the presidency and reflecting the powers of the legislature. To hold together a working majority, past governments have resorted to a range of legal (but politically dubious) pork-barrel behaviours such as offering ministerial positions, awarding spending programmes and constantly adjusting and diluting their legislative programmes to meet the demands of smaller parties and regional special-interest groups.
Tensions simmer as Mr Bolsonaro clashes with other branches Mr Bolsonaro's nationalist populism, his nostalgia for Brazil's military dictatorship (1964-85) and his awarding of cabinet positions to several retired military officials sustain concerns about whether he could potentially trample on the country's fairly young democratic institutions. As his position weakened in 2020 amid police investigations into his family's affairs, Mr Bolsonaro dialled up his authoritarian rhetoric and often appeared with his radical supporters, protesting against Congress and the Supreme Court and calling for military intervention. A rupture of constitutional rule (in the form of the president disobeying Supreme Court rulings) appears unlikely, although it seems that institutions will remain under attack from Mr Bolsonaro as he seeks to exert his influence over them (for example over police and Supreme Court investigations into his sons' business and political activities). A recent survey by Datafolha, a local pollster, showed that 75% of voters support democracy as the best form of government-even though they are disillusioned by the record of parties in power and corruption-and would not acquiesce in the event of an unexpected shift to military rule, reducing the probability of such a scenario. Nor do the active generals running the armed forces show signs of wanting to overthrow the constitution and govern in order to defend the Bolsonaro government.
Even so, tensions between the three branches of government have come to the fore under Mr Bolsonaro. Although the president's removal from office remains improbable, his efforts to discredit the Supreme Court-alongside a longer-term strategy to exert control over its judges (he appointed one in early 2021 and will appoint a second in July, when another judge retires)-could result in sustained tensions between the executive and the judiciary, as well as gradual institutional erosion.
Political outlook: Election watch Assuming that the Supreme Court plenary confirms the recent ruling by a single justice, restoring his political rights, Lula is likely to be the PT candidate in the 2022 presidential election. As Lula will be a stronger rival than Fernando Haddad (who was previously lining up to be the PT candidate), it will be harder for Mr Bolsonaro to win a second term, although the benefits of incumbency still favour him slightly. The election campaign will be even more polarising than previously expected, making it hugely difficult for a centrist candidate to gain traction and make it to a probable second round (more than 50% of valid votes are required in the first round to avoid a run-off). It is still early, but we believe that the election will be a close contest. Both Mr Bolsonaro and Lula suffer from high rejection rates. Winning over middle-ground voters will be the key to success. Mr Bolsonaro is vulnerable, owing to his poor management of the pandemic and vaccine rollout, economic conditions, and any potential adverse news in the event of corruption scandals involving his sons or links to militias. Markets will fret about a Lula victory, even though he will pitch himself as a moderate and would need support from the centrão to build a working majority should he win power.
Political outlook: International relations The president's anti-globalist rhetoric and facilitation of illegal deforestation in the Amazon is tarnishing Brazil's international standing. However, as one of the world's ten largest economies and a major commodity exporter, Brazil will remain a significant global player. Under the administration of the new US president, Joe Biden, bilateral relations will be cooler while Mr Bolsonaro is president, given their divergent stances, particularly on climate change and deforestation. The relationship got off to a bumpy start, as Mr Bolsonaro was the last major world leader to congratulate Mr Biden, but we assume that a pragmatic approach will prevail, with common ground on anti-Chinese sentiment.
Brazil will remain one of the battlegrounds in US-China rivalry; a 5G licence auction scheduled for 2021 will prove tricky for the government, given the local presence of Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications company. Anti-Chinese rhetoric by nationalist government figures is stirring bilateral tensions, but more pragmatic cabinet members will encourage the president to be more welcoming of China's acquisition of assets, as Brazil needs investments in major infrastructure and energy projects. Moreover, Brazil's reliance on the Chinese coronavirus vaccine, Sinovac, will temper anti-Chinese rhetoric. We do not expect a free-trade agreement (FTA) between the EU and Mercosul (the Southern Cone customs union comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) to be ratified soon, owing to EU concerns over Mr Bolsonaro's environmental policies. Now that there is also pressure from Mr Biden on environmental issues, Brazil's efforts to join the OECD face delays.

Brazil remains in the lower half of the business environment global ranking in the 2021-25 forecast period; its score improved, but only enough to lift its regional and global positions by one place. Crisis management in 2020 pushed back reforms, and there is now only a narrow legislative window before campaigning picks up ahead of the October 2022 general election. Still, there will be improvements in some categories of the business environment, such as foreign trade and exchange controls (as the economy becomes slightly more open), as well as policy towards foreign investment and policy towards private enterprise (owing to privatisation). There will be progress in the labour market (more flexibility) and infrastructure (through concessions and better rules), but these will remain weaknesses in the business environment. Notwithstanding the possible unification of some business taxes, The Economist Intelligence Unit does not expect any significant improvement in the unwieldy and time-consuming tax system for businesses; Brazil's score in this area is unchanged, and it is the weakest aspect of the overall investment climate by some degree.
Brazil's large and diversified economy makes it attractive for investors, but its recovery from the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic will be tepid, dampening foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. With the public debt/GDP ratio so high (at 90%), consolidation measures will be needed, crimping growth. The business environment will be shaped by the outcome of the general election, which is highly uncertain at this early stage. Our current view is that the race is Mr Bolsonaro's to lose; our forecasts are based on the assumption of broad continuity under the next administration, implying further piecemeal advances. However, even if a former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-10), wins the election, a swing to the far left would be unlikely, as he would need the support of the political centre to govern. Given structural improvements (including an independent central bank and fiscal responsibility legislation), there is less scope for a dramatic shift in macroeconomic policy, but privatisations would be halted.

Despite a clouded economic outlook, Brazil's regional and global ranking for the macroeconomic environment is slightly better for the 2021-25 forecast period than for the 2016-20 historical period. This partly reflects the fact that Brazil fares relatively well in comparative terms; many similarly ranked countries have been even more severely hit than Brazil by the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic, and they have therefore lost ground in the rankings for the forecast period. Brazil will be among the fastest of the major Latin American economies to recover to pre-pandemic GDP levels, doing so in 2022. However, this largely reflects the large-scale fiscal stimulus that was deployed in 2020, which will damage other areas of Brazil's macroeconomic environment. For example, the country's scores in areas relating to the public finances deteriorate on the back of a huge increase in the fiscal deficit and the public debt stock (now at 90% of GDP). Although we expect the deficit to narrow in 2021-22, we anticipate that it will widen again in the second half of the forecast period, to more than 6% of GDP (in contrast with many other countries, where we expect a sustained period of fiscal consolidation) as debt-servicing costs rise in line with higher interest rates. This will keep public debt high.

- Notwithstanding the slight overall improvement, the macroeconomic environment remains one of the weakest areas of the country's business climate. Brazil scores reasonably for some areas, including inflation; despite risks associated with a resurgence in commodity prices, inflation will generally be better controlled than in the past. The Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank) gained formal independence in February 2021 and began a partial normalisation of the policy interest rate in March (ahead of many emerging markets), after cutting the Selic to a record low of 2% in August 2020 and following a reduction of distortions in credit markets. However, the bright spots are relatively few. There are concerns about the overall quality of policymaking as Mr Bolsonaro gears up for what is likely to be a closely fought re-election bid in October 2022. In turn, the Real will remain vulnerable to bouts of renewed volatility driven by political and fiscal risks. We expect the current-account deficit to widen later in the forecast period as imports rebound and Brazilian tourists venture overseas again. That said, FDI will pick up and match the current-account deficit, lifting the already large stock of international reserves.

We expect some improvements to be made in policy towards private enterprise and competition in 2021-25, mainly reflecting a firmer government commitment to promoting competition. Although progress will be slow, it will nevertheless contribute to a moderate improvement in Brazil's underlying score in this area, as well as a rise of four places in the global ranking. Starting a business has become less cumbersome in recent years, but Brazil remains below average for this metric. Regulations are pervasive, and compliance imposes considerable costs for businesses. The competition regime is equipped with strong powers and enforcement tools. However, weaknesses in institutional capacity at the Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica (CADE, the antitrust body) partly explain why there have been few investigations since the introduction of new competition legislation in 2011 and even fewer decisions by its tribunal. In 2020 it imposed R142m (US$25m) in fines, down sharply from nearly R793m (US$140m) in 2019. Mr Bolsonaro's government originally vowed to reduce political interference in state-controlled companies and appointed chief executive officers (CEOs) chosen by his free-market economy minister, Paulo Guedes. However, Mr Bolsonaro intervened in Petrobras (the state oil firm) in February 2021 by firing its CEO over fuel price policies, and the CEO of Banco do Brasil (a large state-owned retail bank) recently resigned after encountering resistance from the president over restructuring policies. The CEO of Eletrobras (the state-controlled electricity firm) also resigned amid resistance to privatisation efforts from vested interests in Congress.
Privatisation drive will yield limited results amid congressional pushback
- Many important sectors remain dominated by major state players, such as oil and gas (Petrobras), energy (Eletrobras), postal services and distribution (Correios), and-to a lesser degree-banking (Banco do Brasil, Caixa Econômica Federal (Caixa) and BNDES). Upon entering office in January 2019, Mr Guedes advocated a sweeping privatisation programme to reduce public debt and encourage private and foreign investment. The programme sought to divest up to 130 federal state companies by 2022. Although a Supreme Court ruling in June 2019 confirmed that the privatisation of subsidiary companies did not require legislative approval-in theory giving the government considerable leeway to proceed with its plans-progress has been slow. The government has tried to expedite processes, sending a bill to Congress in February 2021 designed to accelerate the sale of part of the government's holding in Eletrobras and pledging a similar bill for Correios. However, progress in 2021-22 will be slow. Legislators still tend to view state-owned companies as a way of exchanging political support for lucrative posts. Even though Mr Bolsonaro has begun to pivot from his initial promises to refrain from "give-and-take" politics (giving cabinet posts and jobs in state agencies to members of centrist parties), legislators may resist divestments in order to keep some power. This will make privatisation of Eletrobras especially challenging. There is a chance that the privatisation of Correios could move forward, but it will still face difficulties.
- Prospects for privatisation in 2023-25 will partly depend on the next government's position on the issue; there is likely to be some continued progress, assuming that Mr Bolsonaro remains in office, although "crown jewel" companies such as Banco do Brasil, Caixa and Petrobras are highly unlikely to be divested. Should Lula win the October 2022 election, privatisation prospects would be weaker. As president in 2003-10, Lula sent mixed signals about his willingness to further open the economy to private-sector participation, with privatisations mainly occurring only at the state level. It is highly likely that the privatisation agenda would be halted altogether if Lula were to take office, reflecting his preference for a strong state role in strategic sectors. However, public-private partnership (PPP) concessions, which were a feature in 2003-16 under governments led by the Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT), would continue.

We expect policy towards foreign investment to be the strongest area of Brazil's business environment in 2021-25. Despite the coronavirus pandemic, Brazil is still one of the top ten recipients of FDI globally; inflows fell in 2020, but not as sharply as for some other large recipients of FDI. The government's pro-market orientation and the fiscal and governance crisis that have affected many local firms since 2014 create opportunities for higher participation of foreign capital in sectors such as transport, logistics, power generation, sanitation, construction and housing, oil and gas, renewable energy, and the airline industry. Brazil's proposed accession to the OECD is likely to face delays owing to concerns about the government's environmental policy stance, but membership is likely later in the forecast period, which will also boost FDI. On the downside, the Bolsonaro government's confrontational leadership style risks making Western foreign investors more cautious about Brazil. Brazilian governments signed a spate of international investment agreements in 2018-19, but no new deals have been signed since one with India in January 2020, largely because of the outbreak of the pandemic. The risk of expropriation remains low.
Infrastructure concessions offer attractive opportunities
- The government has repeatedly adapted the regulatory and legal framework for concessions (particularly in infrastructure) to allow a higher share of foreign funding. In mid-2019 Congress approved a presidential decree authorising aviation companies headquartered in Brazil to have unlimited participation of foreign capital (previously capped at 20%). The coronavirus pandemic delayed the planned auction of several infrastructure concessions (including in the aviation sector), but these are likely to go ahead in 2021-22. The government is seeking to spur investor interest through revised auction terms (lowering fees in a number of airport concession blocks, for example) or by offering risk hedges. In the case of a railway project, the authorities have gone as far as to offer the future concession winner R2.2bn in public money to cover "non-manageable risks". The government has also proposed a series of bills designed to boost private-sector participation, including measures to simplify environmental licensing and encourage foreign-company participation.
- A government bill to update and streamline bidding and procurement laws, as well as to provide additional judicial security for concessionaires (the New Public Procurement Law), was approved by the Senate (the upper house) on December 10th 2020 and now awaits presidential approval. This legislation, combined with other substantial measures-including the government's landmark sanitation regulation, which effectively opened water and sewerage provision to private companies at the state and municipal level-will improve the business environment.

Bureaucracy hampers PPPs
- Legislation passed in 2004 under the Lula government facilitated the development of a PPP strategy and aimed to overcome fiscal constraints by lifting private-sector investment, particularly in infrastructure projects. The law allowed the state to guarantee some level of profitability to the private partner. Subsequent legislation in 2016 created an Investment Partnerships Programme designed to bring together all levels of government and the private sector. However, bureaucratic delays in approving projects and issuing permits have hindered the success of PPPs.
- Foreign investors are guaranteed national treatment by law, but restrictions apply to activities involving nuclear energy, postal and telegraph services (except parcel delivery), some aerospace activities (such as launching and deployment of satellites), acquisition or rental of rural property, media (including television networks, magazines, newspapers and radio broadcasting stations), and mining.
- Although there is a risk that ideological factors will obstruct FDI from some countries, our baseline forecast is that government policy will remain relatively pragmatic. There have been concerns that Mr Bolsonaro would be more inclined to establish alliances with advanced Western countries run by right-wing parties rather than with countries under left-wing governments, affecting commercial and investment relations with China in particular. Notwithstanding some ongoing anti-Chinese rhetoric from the government, the need for Chinese investment so far appears to be outweighing ideological concerns; we expect this to remain the case in 2021-25, assuming that Mr Bolsonaro remains in office. If Lula wins the October 2022 election, there would be less anti-Chinese rhetoric (bilateral relations advanced significantly when Lula was in office). There would nevertheless be an ongoing risk of ideological factors obstructing FDI from some countries, although in this scenario, it would affect advanced Western economies, reflecting a probable shift towards "South-South" trade and investment.

Brazil's score and global ranking improve slightly in 2021-25, although its regional position remains unchanged, reflecting our expectation of moderate improvements elsewhere in Latin America. The mild uptick in Brazil's score is based on a growing openness to foreign trade; exports and imports will still account for a comparatively small share of total GDP, but this share will be higher in the forecast period than in the historical period. Also supporting Brazil's score in this area is the fact that it puts no major restrictions on current- and capital-account flows or on foreign-exchange transactions. However, other areas of foreign trade relating to government policy are much weaker. The free-market agenda espoused by Mr Guedes involves seeking trade deals with overseas countries, opening the economy and removing or lowering existing barriers to imports, as well as restoring the strategic importance of Mercosul (the Southern Cone customs union comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) as a regional trading bloc. However, not only is there domestic resistance to some of this agenda (including from manufacturers and businesspeople who will lobby to delay liberalisation in the context of the 2020 recession and weaker Real), but the external situation is also not particularly conducive to progress. The ongoing pandemic and anti-globalisation movements in the developed world are likely to pose some limits to FTAs between countries and regional blocs, and Mr Bolsonaro's permissive approach to illegal Amazon deforestation will cause relations with the EU and the new US administration to sour further.
EU concerns over environmental policies will delay EU-Mercosul FTA
- Initial celebrations by trade negotiators on both sides following the conclusion of the EU-Mercosul FTA deal in 2019 (after 20 years of on-off talks) soon fizzled out. The deal would bring together a combined population of 780m people and eliminate nearly 100% of EU tariffs and 90% of Mercosul tariffs, assuming that a signed deal were ratified by all Mercosul and EU member parliaments. However, a surge in deforestation of the Amazon rainforest under Mr Bolsonaro has added to protectionist sentiment in some EU food-producing countries, and EU parliaments are unlikely to ratify the deal until after the end of the forecast period, if at all. For Brazil (and Argentina), this provides time for reforms to boost competitiveness in the manufacturing and services sectors. South America's agro-industry has competitive advantages and would benefit from greater EU market access.
- Although the Real is not fully convertible, Brazil puts no major restrictions on current- and capital-account flows or on foreign-exchange transactions. The country's strong international reserves position (about US$352bn as at mid-March, equating to about 18 months of import cover), combined with its solid external sector, provides some support. Prior to the pandemic, policymakers signalled that they wanted to make the Real a convertible currency and turn it into a regional reference currency. However, given recent volatility, we do not expect any significant steps in this direction until conditions settle (later in the forecast period, at best).

Brazil has one of the most time-consuming and complex tax systems in the world; with little significant improvement likely during 2021-25, its score and ranking in this area will remain dismal. Brazil's tax burden (33% of GDP) is on a par with the OECD average, but it is very high by developing-country standards, especially given the poor quality of public services and physical infrastructure. Headline tax rates for most companies are not excessive, but a multitude of indirect taxes raise costs, with drawn-out processes increasing compliance costs. As a result, the total corporate tax burden as a share of profits is close to 65%, which is well above regional and OECD averages (47% and 40% respectively). The huge array of sectoral benefits and tax exemptions is a further cause of inefficiency that hampers competition. Tax simplification, to lower Brazil's high costs of doing business, has been on the agenda for 20 years, but after gaining momentum in 2019, progress stalled given myriad competing interests. The only potential reform in the near term relates to consumption taxes-there are proposals to unify a number of separate taxes into a single value-added tax (VAT)-but even this is far from assured, as the window for pushing legislation through before the 2022 election is narrowing.

- In July 2020 Mr Guedes presented the first part of the government's long-awaited tax reform to congressional leaders. In a planned multiphase rollout, it seeks to unify the federal PIS/Pasep and Cofins consumption taxes on goods and services into a single VAT, known as the Contribuição Social sobre com Bens e Serviços (CBS), levied at 12%. Banking and health insurance sectors would have their rate set at 5.8%. However, the government has yet to submit other elements of the planned tax reform, which could include a 0.2% financial transactions tax, intended to facilitate a reduction in payroll tax contributions (which in turn is designed to boost formal sector job creation). Our baseline forecast is that the first part of the reforms (the simplification of consumption taxes) will be passed in the second half of 2021, but there are growing risks to this projection. We do not expect any progress on other phases of the package, including changes to corporation and income taxes, or payroll contributions.

Brazil's score in this area remains unchanged in 2021-25, keeping Brazil second-ranked regionally, although it slips by three places globally. The BCB rolled out a battery of measures to ensure the smooth functioning of the financial system in response to the pandemic, injecting liquidity and-together with the Treasury-providing loan guarantees through the banking system to companies. Large companies found it easier to secure credit lines than small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), but conditions for SMEs have improved since late 2020. The Federal Reserve (the US central bank) gave Brazil a US$60bn swap line, which will provide continued support with US dollar funding. The BCB also benefits from huge foreign-exchange reserves (US$352bn as at mid-March).

- As the economy recovers, attention will return to BCB measures to improve efficiency and competitiveness, and to reduce the cost of credit. The BCB has started to raise the Selic rate in response to emerging inflationary pressures; it is likely to continue to increase the rate gradually, towards a neutral rate of 2-3% in real terms. In order to dissuade commercial banks from passing on rate hikes to borrowers via higher lending rates, the authorities will focus on ways of increasing liquidity and fostering competition in the banking sector. These efforts are likely to be moderately successful; although the overall cost of credit (for both consumers and companies) will remain fairly high, it should ease, despite a period of moderate monetary policy tightening at the BCB.
- Before the Covid-19 crisis the government scaled back the availability of subsidised and abundant lending from state banks, especially from BNDES, the national development bank. However, state banks became part of lending support measures during the pandemic. In the long run, these loans will be reduced again. Still, state banks will continue to exercise an important role as sectoral lenders, such as in infrastructure (BNDES), agriculture (Banco do Brasil) and housing (Caixa).

The formalisation of BCB autonomy will support stability in the financial system
- Through its "BC# Agenda", the BCB is promoting modern regulations to strengthen the financial system, reduce the cost of credit and promote the regulation of credit fintechs (including facilitating foreign investors' entry into the market). Recent measures include the creation of Pix, an instant payments system that was launched in November 2020, and initial steps to adopt open-banking regulations, which began in February 2021.
- In February 2021 the lower house passed a bill that legally protects the central bank's autonomy, following approval by the Senate in 2020. Although the central bank had de facto autonomy, it was not legally protected. As such, the legislation reduces the risk of political interference in monetary policy. This bodes well for monetary stability and should help to reduce price volatility in the long term, as well as ensuring financial system stability.

Alongside the tax system, the labour market has traditionally been one of the weakest areas of Brazil's business environment. However, we expect a slight improvement in Brazil's underlying score and ranking in this area in the forecast period (in contrast to our less positive expectations for the tax system). This mainly reflects an expected increase in the availability of skilled labour (historically a weak point) and an improvement in the language skills among the workforce. However, both areas will improve from a low base; overall, standards will remain comparatively weak on both a regional and global basis. Despite fairly low wages, the overall cost of labour for employers is still high, with social security obligations and labour benefits adding an extra cost of close to one-third of salaries.

- The 2017 labour legislation was expected to spur job creation by making the labour market more flexible and dynamic. The changes weakened collective bargaining, regulated remote work and gave businesses more control over workers' hours and holiday time. However, the persistently high unemployment rate (12% even before the coronavirus pandemic, rising to over 14% in early 2021) suggests that the legislation had not helped that much, although economic conditions were still weak in 2018-19. Nevertheless, there has been a huge fall in the number of labour lawsuits entering courts, reducing the high and unpredictable legal costs to firms. Under the 2017 legislation, employees who sue an employer and lose the case must pay lawyers' fees.
- In what is seen as the government's new labour reform, Mr Guedes has revived plans for a more flexible labour contractual arrangement via the Carteira de Trabalho Verde Amarela (Green and Yellow Labour Register). The legislation was enacted by presidential decree (MP 905) in November 2019 but expired after Congress failed to approve it before the 120-day validity period elapsed in April 2020 owing to a combination of coronavirus-related disruption to legislative business and pushback from lawmakers over the erosion of labour rights. In response to the pandemic, the government launched the Programa Emergencial de Manutenção do Emprego e da Renda (BEm), which served as a job retention scheme for companies, providing transfers to supplement lost income for workers. Although unemployment has risen, the government claims that it saved 11m jobs in 2020. The BEm expired at the end of 2020, and the government is now hoping to revive the Labour Register in the hope that it will stimulate job creation. The proposal creates a new type of employment agreement to incentivise companies to offer people between 19 and 29 years old their first formal job in exchange for benefits relating mainly to payroll taxation. However, given some resistance from legislators, it is unclear whether this measure will be adopted. Even if it is passed, other structural constraints will hamper job creation.
- Measures to reduce the cost of labour in the short to medium term may well be implemented. First, the government seems inclined to alleviate the burden of formal labour by exempting or reducing payroll contributions. Secondly, the rules defining the monetary value of the minimum wage may change after wage rises in the past far surpassed productivity gains. Up until 2019, the minimum wage increased every year, according to past inflation (as defined in the constitution) plus the real GDP growth rate of two years earlier. The 2011 law formalising this framework expired in 2019. For 2020-21 the government set the minimum wage according to past inflation only, suggesting that this might remain official policy. A Lula government would probably seek to revert to the terms of the 2011 law.

Infrastructure concessions will result in some progress Brazil's infrastructure has suffered from a lack of investment in recent decades, contributing to a particularly weak score for the historical period. We expect some moderate improvements in 2021-25, reflecting the government's focus on infrastructure projects as a way of attracting investment and engineering a recovery from the 2020 recession. The coronavirus pandemic delayed planned auctions of infrastructure concessions, but these are likely to restart soon. The scope for growth, the size of the market and new regulations in some sub-sectors offer investors attractive opportunities, which are likely to translate into some progress in infrastructure over the forecast period. However, political and policy uncertainty will persist, and unresolved questions about the allocation of public expenditure may hamper the pace of progress. The deleveraging of BNDES will also result in more selective lending by the national development bank, which is traditionally a big funder of infrastructure projects in the energy and logistics sectors.

- The infrastructure ministry has built up an ambitious backlog of concession plans. Although the pandemic delayed a number of projects-partly owing to drops in road and air traffic-the Tribunal de Contas da União (TCU, the federal accounts court) pushed ahead, approving concession plans and green-lighting auctions to begin in 2021. Among other plans, the government is focusing on drumming up investor interest around three major auctions, namely the new Dutra highway connecting Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, the Ferrogrão grain railway from the state of Mato Grosso to Pará, and the sixth round of airport concessions. Overall, 2021 concession plans include 17 ports, 11 major highways, three railways, and 23 airports, altogether expected to draw in R137bn in investment. A seventh round of airport concessions, including Rio de Janeiro's Santos Dumont and São Paulo's Congonhas, is scheduled for 2022.
- The infrastructure minister, Tarcísio Gomes de Freitas, is well regarded by the private sector and has framed the concessions issue as a question of circumventing fiscal limitations; freeing up funds from cumbersome maintenance costs on state-run roads (for example) will provide his ministry with the budget needed to expand the government's public works projects. As such, government commitment to the concessions programme will remain firm in the first half of the forecast period. We do not expect the government's policy towards infrastructure to alter in the second half of our forecast period regardless of the election outcome; even if Lula were to win the presidency, he promoted investment in infrastructure during his tenure, and fiscal constraints mean that private-sector investment in the sector will be necessary.

Brazil scores reasonably well in terms of technological readiness. The government views information and communication technology (ICT) as a strategic area. It introduced a National Plan for the Internet of Things (IoT) in mid-2019, designed jointly by the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (in June 2020 the government moved communications into a separate ministry), the economy ministry and BNDES. The plan implements actions across several other ministries (agriculture, health and regional development) in areas such as innovation support, international outreach, infrastructure for connectivity and data privacy regulations. Universities have an important role in innovation. Links with the industry are weak but will continue to grow. In 2019 Brazil registered the highest number of patent applications of low- and middle-income countries, according to the World Intellectual Property Organisation.

- Brazil is Latin America's largest internet market in terms of users but lags Chile, Argentina and Mexico in terms of penetration. A digitalisation drive brought about by the pandemic has caused internet user penetration to rise, a trend that we expect to continue in 2021-25. We expect the ongoing rise in fibre investment and adoption of broadband connections to support overall growth.

5G auctions are likely in 2021
- Nearly 75% of mobile subscriptions use 4G technology. The Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel, the telecommunications agency) is likely to hold auctions for 5G frequencies in mid-2021. The government would like these to become operational in 2022, although local operators are pressing for a five-year transition. The launch of 5G technology would be the first major step towards the IoT, providing a broad and direct connection of devices, computers and machines.
- Electronic commerce (e-commerce), which was already becoming more prominent before the pandemic, soared in 2020. Over 30% of Brazilians are regular online shoppers, with most online transactions completed on smartphones and tablets. Much of the recent growth is attributable to consumers making online purchases of groceries and staples (rather than just consumer electronics and non-food products, as was the case previously).
- The digital revolution has fostered over 13,400 start-ups, according to the Associação Brasileira de Startups (the start-ups association), especially in banking and finance, education, transport and logistics, and food delivery. Eighteen Brazilian start-ups have become local "unicorns"-each worth over US$1bn-although stockmarket losses in the first half of 2020 reduced their value.

Economic forecast: Policy trends Policymaking in 2021 will focus on the worsening coronavirus pandemic and the structural reform agenda. Policymaking will be more unpredictable and populist, as the president, Jair Bolsonaro, seeks to avoid unpopular measures ahead of the 2022 elections and panders to his various groups of supporters. This was evident in his recent interference in the state oil firm, Petrobras (to appease truckers' unions, who paralysed the country during a strike in 2018), after it raised fuel prices in line with international increases. Market risks include a change in Petrobras's pricing regime and possible efforts to reduce electricity tariffs by changing some rules of the game. If the economy fails to pick up after a recession in the first half of 2021, a more expansionary fiscal stance than expected in the 2022 election year cannot be ruled out, although it would encounter resistance in Congress.
After a lull ahead of the February congressional leadership elections, there has been a flurry of legislative activity, as the new leader of the lower house, Arthur Lira presided over the landmark approval of formal central bank independence (some 20 years in the making) and the so-called Emergency PEC (a constitutional amendment) that provides greater flexibility in budget management by triggering automatic cuts, should overall spending put Brazil's 2016 expenditure cap rules (zero growth in spending in real terms)-a key anchor for fiscal policy-in jeopardy. The bill excluded R44bn in emergency cash payments to the poor (around a tenth of that disbursed last year) between April and July.
The next legislative priority will be to pass the (delayed) 2021 budget. Thereafter, attention will turn to public-sector reforms, which aim to reduce the costly public-sector wage bill over the long term, where there is political consensus for approval. Other economic reforms will encounter more difficulties, although The Economist Intelligence Unit still expects some progress by end-2021. Among them is a revenue-neutral tax simplification reform to unify three or more consumption taxes into a single value-added tax (VAT). Likewise, progress on the privatisation agenda will be slow, owing to weak support from the centrão, as many of its members have vested interests in state companies. If any privatisations move forward, we expect them to be of smaller, non-strategic assets, such as the state-owned postal service; privatisation of Eletrobras, the state electricity company, is unlikely.

Total public sector debt 88.8 89.9 92.0 94.6 96.8 98.4
After surging to 90% in 2020, owing to pandemic-related support measures, currency depreciation and recession, the public debt/GDP ratio will inch up, as fiscal revenue only partly recovers and the government provides emergency cash payments for the poor, albeit on a more limited scale than last year. Stopping a more substantial rise will require consolidation; otherwise, concerns about debt sustainability will re-emerge among investors, raising the country risk premium. The government will seek to avoid raising taxes ahead of the 2022 elections, but tax increases thereafter cannot be ruled out. The fiscal hit from the crisis is apparent in the widening of the 12-month rolling overall deficit, to 13.7% of GDP in January 2021. We expect measures to be mostly retracted in 2021; the deficit will narrow to 7.6% of GDP as revenue increases. Consolidation of these trends will keep the deficit smaller than 7% of GDP throughout 2022-25. We anticipate that public debt will stabilise within the forecast period, helped by privatisation proceeds and currency revaluation, but there is a risk that debt will exceed 100% if the president yields to an election-related increase in spending.

As the economy recovers in 2021-25, we expect policy normalisation, which began in March with a 75-basis-point hike, to take the Selic policy rate from 2.75% currently to 6% by 2022 (a real interest rate of 2-3%, which we consider neutral, up from over -2% currently). The mid-point inflation target will fall by 25 basis points each year in 2021-23, from 3.75% to 3.25% (the 2024 target will be set in 2021 and could fall further). The most significant risk to the environment of low interest rates and inflation is an unexpected abandonment of spending cap rules, which could trigger a market sell-off that may force the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank) to tighten policy by more than expected.

Following a 4.1% contraction in 2020, real GDP will recover partly in 2021, expanding by 3.2%, and grow at rates averaging 2.1% in 2022-25. Our forecasts assume the approval of fiscal reforms and progress on other microeconomic reform agenda items, but we recognise that governability risks could hamper advances. Growth in 2021 overall will be mostly due to strong "carry-over" statistical effects from the 2020 rebound, as sequential growth will be curbed by the withdrawal of most fiscal stimulus and rising interest rates and inflation. Moreover, we expect real GDP to contract in the first half of 2021 amid renewed mobility restrictions as the public health crisis worsens. A gradual pick-up thereafter assumes a wider distribution of coronavirus vaccines, along with a recovering global economy. However, lasting damage to the productive sector and jobs, as well as corporate and household balance sheets, means that we do not expect output to return to pre-coronavirus levels until 2022.
On the demand side, the upturn in 2021-25 will be driven by stronger investment (buoyed by infrastructure concessions and notwithstanding a normalisation in interest rates) and by private consumption. The re-introduction of (more limited) emergency cash transfers for the poor in April-July (another extension cannot be ruled out) will prop up consumption slightly until the jobs market strengthens later in the year. On the supply side, commodity exports will accelerate in 2021-25, in line with a recovery in global demand. Manufacturing has already rebounded, owing to stimulus for consumers and a weaker currency, which could continue to make goods more competitive against imports in 2021-25. Positive vaccine news should boost consumer and business confidence, but the recovery of the services sector will not materialise fully until vaccines have been distributed beyond vulnerable groups, which should happen from mid-2021.

Economic forecast: Sectoral trends Forecast growth rates for agriculture (which accounts for 7% of GDP), industry (accounting for 20%) and services (accounting for 73%) will be influenced by their recoveries from the 2020 pandemic-induced shock, structural factors and sectoral dynamics. Agriculture was barely affected in 2020 and grew by 2%, supported by external demand. Output levels in industry (and retailing) showed a V-shaped recovery (although they ended full-year 2020 in negative territory because of lost output in the second quarter). Services was hit the hardest (particularly services related to interactions with households; business services and public administration were not as badly affected) and will not return to pre-pandemic output levels until mobility restrictions are fully lifted.
Agriculture has a crucial role that belies its small share of GDP, owing to its significance as an employer in rural areas and the importance of agribusiness industries and food processing for the domestic market and exports. Favourable weather has led to rising grain harvests in the past five years, reaching an estimated 272,000 tonnes in the 2020/21 harvest. The sector will remain vulnerable to adverse weather (particularly the cyclical El Niño weather phenomenon), but will be supported by technological improvements and more intensive land use, as well as by fair fundamentals for soft-commodity exports, owing to rising demand in the developing world.
Manufacturing is constrained by competitiveness weaknesses Despite piecemeal reform efforts, the post-pandemic outlook for manufacturing will be hindered by competitiveness shortcomings that have plagued the sector for many years, contributing to a decline in its share of total GDP, from 15% in 2000 to less than 10% currently. These include a high tax burden, poor infrastructure and high labour costs. Import competition was also a factor: the Real was overvalued during the commodity boom (2005-12) and because of Brazil's high interest rates. However, since 2016-17 these latter factors have eased and the Real no longer appears overvalued, providing some respite. However, light-manufacturing industries in particular have lost market share in recent years, owing to a surge in Chinese imports. Capital goods industries will face similar problems, but will be supported by domestic demand. Higher investment will enable some labour-intensive manufacturing activities to move up the value chain, but many will struggle to cope with rising import competition. Brazil's manufacturing sector has been mostly inward-looking and-with a few exceptions-companies have failed to develop linkages with global production systems. The government wants to change this through liberalisation, but policymakers are likely to dial down their ambitious plans because of the hit to manufacturing from Covid-19 and the probable long recovery from the crisis.
The vehicles and parts industry accounts for about one-fifth of manufacturing. The Covid-19 pandemic brought Brazil's automotive industry temporarily to a halt; automotive plants shut down as a result of quarantine measures, causing production to fall by 31.6%. The Associação Nacional dos Fabricantes de Veículos Automotores (Anfavea, the vehicles industry body) expects a partial recovery in 2021, with output growing by 25%. The recovery in demand will depend on the success of quarantine exit strategies, with the potential for further waves of the virus (such as an ongoing one that began in February) to cause renewed disruptions to economic activity. We expect the rebound in consumer and business confidence and credit to be modest, as Brazil's labour market and productive sector will struggle to recover over the medium term. We expect annual vehicle output to recover to its 2019 level of 2.8m by 2025, but to remain well below the peak of 3.8m units produced in 2012, at the height of Brazil's boom.
Extractive industries should perform reasonably well in the medium term. Although the secular slowdown in China dampens the outlook for Brazil's export commodities, demand growth will continue to support mining activity, notably of iron ore. Investment in other mining activities will be boosted following reforms to the mining law in 2018 (lifting royalties for the government and improving the regulatory framework).
Huge reserves of oil and gas could turn Brazil into one of the world's top ten oil exporters. Local production of oil, gas, coal and electricity in 2020 was contained owing to unplanned and maintenance outages, skeletal staffing and limited demand. The government postponed tenders that were scheduled to take place for developing oil and gas concessions, and for power-generation capacity. We expect a surge in oil and gas production later in the forecast period, with investments in Brazil's pre-salt areas-where significant reserves are held beneath thick layers of salt under the seabed-boosting output.
Services sector is unlikely to recover much dynamism Most components of the services sector, which accounts for over 70% of GDP, are unlikely to recover much dynamism in the medium term, as they are impaired by low productivity and skills shortages. When credit growth recovers (in the medium term), it is expected to be 5-10% weaker in real terms than during Brazil's credit boom in 2006-12. It will also be weaker than in 2020, when government crisis support led to a 12% real gain. However, retail, financial services, ICT and trade will outperform the sector average during the recovery phase.
Growth in retail volumes will pick up slightly in 2021-22, before slowing again in 2023 as economic growth decelerates. Improved underlying economic conditions in 2024-25 are likely to spur firmer growth in retail volumes. Many consumers have traded down, but will continue to shop across different channels, which poses challenges for retailers. Convenience stores will remain popular across income groups in urban areas, but mobile-internet shopping is gaining popularity among young adults.
Economic forecast: Inflation % 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025

Unit labour costs (US$-based) -20.2 -0.9 8.1 5.0 4.5 4.0
A stronger policy framework than in the past will help to anchor inflation expectations, and minimum-wage increases are unlikely to be much above inflation (if at all). Even with an aggressive pace of monetary policy normalisation now under way, there is a risk that inflation expectations will become unanchored if the government's commitment to fiscal consolidation wavers. Inflation reached 5.2% in February (above this year's 3.75% midpoint target); we consider that the rise in inflation since mid-2020-related to higher food and commodity prices, a weaker currency and higher demand created by emergency cash transfers last year-will lift the 12-month rate over 7% in the second quarter, before moderating thereafter. Assuming a gradual economic recovery in 2021-25, and barring periodic weather-related food shortages, an unexpected surge in oil prices or fiscal slippage, inflation should fluctuate close to the (lower) midpoint targets of 3.5% in 2022 and 3.25% in 2023.

Swings in global conditions and jitters over fiscal risks will keep the Real volatile, but it should continue to regain some of its 2020 losses over the medium term, as policy rates rise and the economy recovers. The Real was trading at R5.6:US$1 in late March, amid renewed depreciation pressures reflecting deteriorating economic expectations and market jitters over fiscal risks. We expect the Real to strengthen to R5:US$1 by 2025, fluctuating in line with Brazil's terms of trade, interest-rate differentials and global risk sentiment. A deeper local capital market for long-term debt will discourage corporate external borrowing, reducing capital inflows. The main risk to the forecast is the possibility of a market sell-off if confidence in debt sustainability evaporates.

Risks to Brazil's external position will be assuaged by its modest current-account deficit and external debt ratio, comfortable reserves cushion and a Real no longer overvalued by high interest rates (as in the past). Public external debt is low, and most companies have some sort of currency hedge, despite moderate private external debt. The trade balance will post a large structural surplus in 2021-25, owing to stable commodity exports to China, but this will narrow gradually, as imports rise following recession-related compression in 2020.
After narrowing in 2020, the current-account deficit will widen gradually in 2021-25, as imports recover in line with the economy, and will reach 3.5% of GDP in 2025. However, inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) will match this, averaging 3.6% of GDP in 2021-25, reflecting sizeable market opportunities.

Economic forecast: Foreign direct investment in Brazil Stocks and flows Brazil is one of the largest foreign direct investment (FDI) recipients and preferred investment destinations in Latin America. Globally, Brazil usually ranks as one of the top ten recipients of FDI in the world. In 2020 total FDI inflows (including intercompany transfers and reinvested profits) fell to an estimated US$34bn, or 2.4% of GDP. Foreign investments had previously shown some resilience during difficult economic times: average FDI inflows of US$72bn during the 2015-16 crisis and the 2017-19 post-crisis period were not that far below the US$88bn average during the boom 2010-14 years. By end-2020 the FDI stock had reached US$854bn (59% of GDP).
Origin and distribution Companies from the US and Europe have traditionally been the biggest investors, but in recent years Chinese companies have entered the market, acquiring assets in electricity, infrastructure, oil and services. Other relevant countries investing in Brazil are Mexico, Japan, Singapore and Argentina. Distribution of incoming FDI is fairly broad-based across agriculture, extractive industries, manufacturing and services, reflecting opportunities in Brazil's broad-based economy.
Determinants Brazil's attractiveness to foreign investors has generally been determined by a combination of its market size, regional influence, macroeconomic stability, richness of natural resources and diversified industrial base. The country is a major global player in agribusiness, mineral commodities and bioenergy. However, its complex tax system, relatively unstable legal framework and high borrowing costs have precluded a more abundant inflow of foreign investments.
Impact FDI has played an increasingly important role in recent infrastructure concessions and in the "pre-salt" oil rounds. In this sense, FDI is considered a key success factor in the promotion of higher capital productivity and sustained long-term growth. From a balance-of-payments perspective, FDI has fully covered the current-account deficit in recent years, allowing a healthy and balanced exchange between Brazil and the rest of the world. Although it is hard to measure the direct effects of FDI on productivity, it is clear that there is a positive correlation between the presence of international companies operating in Brazil and research and development activity: patents filed by non-residents through the Brazilian offices amounted to 20,200 in 2017, far exceeding the 7,500 patents filed by residents.
Potential As the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic eases, a gradual recovery in FDI is likely to emerge, and the opening of the economy should make the country an interesting investment opportunity in the 2021-25 forecast period. There is a moderate chance of changes in the tax system that would combine five taxes (federal, state and municipal) into one single value-added tax (VAT), which would greatly simplify the country's complex tax system, considered one of the major barriers to investment. However, privatisation opportunities will be more disappointing than they appeared when the current president, Jair Bolsonaro, took office, as he has little appetite to take on vested interests in Congress who obstruct divestments.

Brazil is undergoing a rapid demographic transition marked by a reduction in birth rates and an increase in life expectancy that is dampening GDP growth potential. In 2000 there were 52.1m people in the country aged 0-14 (corresponding to 30% of the population), according to the national institute of statistics (IBGE). By 2020 this age group accounted for 44.2m people (21.1% of the population), equivalent to a 9.1-percentage-point fall over 20 years. In the same period the share accounted for by the elderly population (those aged over 65) rose by 4.2 points, from 5.6% in 2000 to 9.2% in 2020. The 2020 census was postponed to 2021 because of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Given IBGE's projections for 2030, the share of the elderly population should reach 13.5%, an increase of 5.2 percentage points from 2020.
Rapid demographic transition will hit the workforce The ratio of the working-age population (15-64 years) to the total population is peaking; it rose from 68.9% in 2015 to 69.7% in 2020, and is expected to fall again to 69.4% in 2025. This will increase the old-age dependency ratio (the degree to which elderly population depends on the working-age population). In 2025 the old-age dependency ratio is forecast to reach 0.16, meaning that there will be 16 old-aged people depending on 100 people of working age (in 2002 this ratio was 0.10). Future workers will therefore suffer much more acute pressure to finance the increasing number of pension beneficiaries. This is unlikely to be resolved by productivity gains in the labour market, as the current education and skills levels of the workforce are low, and we do not expect them to advance significantly over the next decade.
Solving the pension system imbalance by raising taxes or labour contributions would be costly and counterproductive. Given the already relatively high tax burden in Brazil, additional tax increases would increase production costs, reduce the level of employment and ultimately limit consumption, growth and revenue collection. In sum, Brazil's demographic transition challenges the fiscal and financial sustainability of the country's current "pay-as-you-go" pension system, even after the landmark pension reform in 2019. Another attempt at reform will be needed in the next five to ten years.
The pandemic will stretch the public healthcare system even further Population ageing affects not only the social security system, but also the healthcare system, as it increases medical and hospital costs. The country has one of the largest public healthcare systems in the world; the 1988 constitution made healthcare universal and decentralised, according to the degree of treatment complexity (municipalities are responsible for basic care and states for medium to high levels of care). However, even before Covid-19, the system was already overstretched owing to growing demand, an effect that had been boosted by the 2014-16 economic crisis, which caused many people to migrate from private healthcare insurance (mostly through company schemes) to public health services. Demand will only increase, stretching budgets.
Despite its young population (the average age is just under 30), Brazil spends 13-14% of GDP on pension-related payments and benefits. In comparison, the total sum of public spending on health and education is not much above 10% of GDP.
Given the speed of the demographic transition and the pressure that it puts on the pension and health systems, labour productivity would have to rise to levels that are probably unthinkable in the long run. Although immigration could be a potential driver for promoting labour productivity, there has not been a policy designed to attract skilled labour, nor is there likely be one in the near future. Most of the recent immigrants (primarily from South Korea, China, Bolivia, Haiti and Venezuela) have been absorbed by low-skill functions in the retail sector rather than in industry, where most of the demand for high-skilled labour is found.

A tepid recovery from the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic-together with currency volatility caused by rising fiscal and political risks-will cause larger than normal fluctuations in Brazil's market size, and it will take several years for the country to recover to pre-crisis output levels. Indeed, in 2020 Brazil fell out of the top ten world economies: in 2019 it was the ninth-largest economy in the world, with total GDP of just over US$1.8trn, but it now has fallen to 12th place owing to the crisis, with total GDP of just over US$1.4trn. Given its large population (more than 210m people, the fifth-largest in the world), GDP per head was US$8,753 (at market exchange rates) in 2019, falling in 2020 to US$6,822. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Brazil's GDP per head to recover to US$9,004 by 2025, making it an upper-middle-income country and the 60th-70th richest in the world (depending on the metrics used).
Market recovery from the Covid-19 crisis will take several years Nonetheless, when measured by purchasing power parity, per-head income is higher (falling to US$12,112 in 2020, then rising to US$17,999 by 2025). The divergence between the GDP per head measured by market rates and purchasing power parity reflects the fact that, in emerging economies such as Brazil, lower wages make the price of services and non-traded goods relatively cheap compared with richer countries. Given that services represent more than 70% of GDP, per-head income measured by the purchasing power parity exchange rate tends to be higher than at the market exchange rate.
The relatively low median monthly personal income (about US$440 at current exchange rates) results in a low marginal propensity to save and high marginal propensity to spend. According to 2019 research by the Associação Brasileira das Entidades dos Mercados Financeiro e de Capitais (Anbima, the financial and capital market entities' association), 56% of Brazilians do not have any financial investments; in the long term, this could improve as financial technology "fintech" platforms become more widespread. Although sizeable fiscal stimulus in 2020 in the form of cash transfers has led to an increase in savings, this is likely to prove temporary. The share of households earning over US$10,000 fell to an estimated 46% in 2020 and is unlikely to return to the 59% reported in 2019 during the 2021-25 outlook period.
Household consumption is high, but savings are low The high share of income diverted to consumption means that household consumption represents about 67% of the country's total GDP. Government consumption is fairly high for a developing country, at about 20% of GDP. The flipside of this is that savings and investments are very low, with gross fixed investments representing only 15% of GDP. Even in families who save some of their income, most allocate it in conservative instruments, primarily in savings accounts with low interest rates, sometimes even below-inflation rates (real savings interest rates are negative). A low level of knowledge about financial products also explains the low levels of savings, so most families do not get much extra income from financial returns.
Low levels of savings reduce the amount of financial guarantees and collateral available to households to borrow from banks. This helps to explain why total domestic credit extended by banks to the private sector represents a little over 60% of GDP in Brazil. Most of the consumption is therefore diverted to goods and services that are less dependent on credit, such as non-durable goods (food and beverages, health and beauty) and semi-durable goods (clothing, household goods and electronic equipment). Consumption of durable goods, such as automobiles and housing, which are based on lending, seems to have been too dependent on government stimulus in the past; the boom and bust cycle between 2003 and 2014 illustrates these consumer and credit trends. These trends are reflected in electronic commerce (e-commerce) as well. Even though the Covid-19 pandemic has propelled digital growth, consumer behaviour has changed little. We estimate that online sales, which were growing steadily until 2019, jumped by more than 50% in 2020, to about R156bn (US$30bn), accounting for about 9% of total retail sales. Much of this growth is attributable to consumers making online purchases of groceries and staples.

Corporate and household balance sheets will suffer amid a tepid recovery The Covid-19 crisis caused a steep 4.1% decline in GDP in 2020, and we expect a partial recovery in 2021, as the economy continues to suffer. The damage to the public finances, and to corporate and household balance sheets, means that the recovery will generally be "swoosh-shaped", although we anticipate some bumps along the way, including a technical recession in first-half 2021, as the public health crisis is still raging amid a slow vaccine rollout. The impact of the recession will vary between regions owing to pronounced disparities in income and growth; incomes will rise slowly in the coming years, but southern states will do better than the rest, especially as they depend more on agriculture, which has held up better than industry and services amid the pandemic. Brazil is made up of 26 states-plus the federal district-divided into five regions. The North and North-east are home to 36% of the population, represent 23.6% of national income and almost 20% of GDP. Strengths are the industrial production of durable and semi-durable goods in the Manaus Free-Trade Zone (in the North) and agriculture and mining (in the North-east). The South-east region accounts for 42% of the population, 51% of income and 53% of GDP, and has a diversified industrial, agricultural and services base, especially in the state of São Paulo. The Central-west, Brazil's agricultural belt, specialises in livestock, grains (soybean and corn) and cotton, and accounts for 7.7% of the population, 8.5% of income and 10% of GDP. Finally, the South has 14.3% of the population, 17% of income and 17% of GDP, and mostly specialises in agro-industry.

From May 2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth forecasts have been revised to take into account the economic impact of climate change.
The economic impact of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic will dampen annual GDP growth rates in 2021-30, which will average only 2%. Based on The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term growth model, annual GDP will pick up to 1.9% on average in 2031-50, lower than in 1991-2014 (3% growth on average). The uptick in 2031-50 assumes that labour productivity growth will accelerate beyond recent historical levels, which have been poor. This will be needed if worsening demographic factors are to be offset. If policy improvements and structural reforms exceed expectations, faster growth would be achievable.
Initial conditions: Brazil's advantages of vast natural-resource potential and a young labour force are mitigated by a series of structural constraints, including weak political effectiveness, a generally low level of education and skills, income disparities, low savings rates, chronic underinvestment in infrastructure, and heavy public debt. Other than in the agricultural sector, productivity growth has been disappointing in recent years, despite the manufacturing sector taking advantage of exchange-rate appreciation in 2005-14 to increase imports of more advanced machinery and equipment. Gradual improvements in the quality and availability of primary and secondary education, as well as efforts to address infrastructure deficiencies, simplify the convoluted tax system and reduce red tape, will underpin stronger productivity growth in the long term. Our projections are based on expectations that a commitment to macroeconomic discipline will prevail.
Demographic trends: Brazil's demographic profile will become less supportive of growth prospects further into the long-term period. Even though a declining birth rate and a relatively static mortality rate will push up the median age of the population, the median age will remain low compared with major economies such as the US, western European countries and Japan. Given that population growth will begin to outpace working-age growth early in the 2020s, Brazil's "demographic dividend" is close to ending, and policymakers will have the challenge of addressing the fiscal burden of an ageing population.
External conditions: Structural external vulnerabilities have declined, but the Brazilian economy remains exposed to changes in external financial market conditions owing to its low domestic savings rates, and the volume of external capital inflows is strongly correlated with risk aversion. Although the public sector has been cautious about external borrowing, corporates have borrowed overseas and can be affected by sudden stops in capital flows. Increasing trade openness and continued diversification of export partners will allow the country to continue benefiting from global trade growth. Brazil's strong competitive advantage in agricultural production and its large industrial export base provide some insulation from commodity price shocks. Global trade liberalisation is expected to make little headway; combined with rising international pressure to contain deforestation, this will prevent Brazil from realising its full export potential, particularly in the agricultural sector.
Institutions and policy trends: Democracy has consolidated since the return to civilian rule in 1985. However, many political institutions are still ineffective; in particular, the political spectrum is fragmented into several relatively weak parties, producing a legislature dominated by vested interests. This will improve slightly, assuming that efforts to enhance party loyalty and electoral measures to reduce the number of political parties in Congress eventually materialise. Fiscal pressures will continue to mount despite watered-down efforts to pass reforms to cap the benefits and entitlements enshrined in the 1988 constitution and limit public-sector spending. Spending commitments will rise as the population ages. Tax revenue is already high, at 34% of GDP, so adjusting the public finances to stabilise and reduce Brazil's high public debt/GDP ratio (which rose to 90% in 2020) will prove challenging. A heavy debt burden will keep interest payments high, crowding out the private sector. With much public expenditure characterised by poor effectiveness, fiscal policy will not make a major contribution to long-term growth. Our long-term growth forecasts assume slow improvements in the business environment as a result of the gradual (albeit uneven) implementation of structural reforms, which will help to ease other constraints on GDP growth, including the convoluted tax system, infrastructure shortcomings and labour market weaknesses. We expect these measures to start to improve Brazil's relative attractiveness for investors only after 2030. Regulatory issues will be addressed gradually, and the judiciary should become more efficient over time.
Long-term performance: Brazil will struggle to gain much ground on the US, with GDP per head (in US dollars at purchasing power parity) amounting to 25% of that of the US in 2050. Macroeconomic stability will continue to reduce volatility in economic growth, and our forecast for GDP expansion of 1.9% per year in 2021-50 will be weaker than the average in 1991-2014 (3%). Improvements in infrastructure, trade expansion, a broader presence of multinational business and a reduction in the debt-service burden will mitigate slower labour force growth and should help to lift labour productivity growth throughout the long-term outlook period. This is dependent on progress in the politically difficult process of institutional reforms. Our outlook is based on the assumption that governments will remain broadly committed to pushing through changes in the long term. Otherwise, productivity growth and average GDP growth rates will fall short of our forecasts. The country's political system makes it hard to advance structural reforms. Political reforms could alter this, although these appear intractable. The commercial exploitation of the proceeds of Brazil's huge reserves of deepwater oil is factored into our baseline forecasts, and major setbacks in this regard would therefore pose a downside risk to our long-term forecasts. Our forecasts now capture the impact of climate change; we believe that Brazil's GDP in 2050 will be 4% smaller than what it would have been without climate change.

Long-term outlook: Long-term trends Environmental policies present downside risks to growth Since taking office, the president, Jair Bolsonaro, has pursued a combination of hands-off rhetoric and anti-environmental policies, mixing talk of national sovereignty rights over the huge portion of the Amazon forest that falls within Brazil's borders with efforts to strip environmental controls. Data from the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE, the space research institute) show that deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest increased by 13% between August 2019 and July 2020 (when it hit a 12-year high); this is over 180% higher than the legal target laid out in the 2009 National Policy on Climate Change. A round of mass firings has constrained efficiency at the Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais (Ibama, the environmental protection agency), meaning that seizures of illegal timber and issuances of fines have plummeted since Mr Bolsonaro took office. The government has obscured agricultural ministry data on cattle movement and pushed through a decree that critics say increases illegal land grabs and sales. Mr Bolsonaro's more recent efforts to control deforestation-including deploying the armed forces to police the Amazon in place of Ibama agents-has achieved only lacklustre results.
International pressure has risen in response to Mr Bolsonaro's policies as climate change increasingly becomes a global policy priority. There had already been some backlash in 2018-19 against Mr Bolsonaro's policies against raging forest fires and deforestation, including freezes on funding from the Norwegian and German governments to an Amazon preservation fund, although the former US president, Donald Trump (2017-21), provided Mr Bolsonaro with some political cover. Nonetheless, the election of Joe Biden in the US is bringing new impetus to global efforts to combat climate change and will place Brazil's environmental policies at the centre of the bilateral agenda. Moving forward, Brazil will face rising diplomatic isolation amid higher deforestation rates, which will have ripple effects on the country's foreign policy agenda and will bring economic consequences. For instance, Mr Bolsonaro's environmental policies are providing a political platform to European green parties, as well as farm lobbies, to block the ratification of the trade agreement between the EU and Mercosul (the Southern Cone customs union comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) that was signed in mid-2019. It could also result in temporary boycotts by European importers. Moreover, the Biden administration has discussed incorporating deforestation goals into other areas of bilateral relations, such as Brazil's efforts to secure OECD membership, which is one of the key ambitions of Mr Bolsonaro's government. Pressure from the private sector (both foreign and domestic) is also rising, as some European investment funds are threatening to pull their assets out of Brazil. Overall, the rising popularity of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment frameworks could increasingly affect investment flows into Brazil.
Notwithstanding this international pressure, and the economic implications that they entail, it appears that an about-turn in environmental policy and improvements in environmental indicators may only materialise after Mr Bolsonaro's tenure ends, especially as he is ramping up his nationalist rhetoric in the run-up to the 2022 presidential election. This means that climate policy is unlikely to change for however long Mr Bolsonaro remains in office. Now that a former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-10), is permitted to run again, the October 2022 presidential election will be more competitive. If Lula were to win, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects that his government would take a more active role in promoting climate policy on the global stage, in line with Brazil's traditional foreign policy focus as a promoter of green policy as the "guardian of the Amazon" under previous Lula governments as well as other administrations headed by his Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT). However, in practice, Lula's track record on the environment is questionable: he oversaw record-high deforestation rates. Overall, institutional capacity to combat deforestation is limited, and Brazil's high deforestation rates will therefore remain a major roadblock in its trade and investment agenda in the long term.
New innovations in fintech offer opportunities for growth and financial inclusion A technological revolution in Brazil's financial sector will support the country's long-term recovery from the coronavirus (Covid-19) recession and open up new avenues for innovation in electronic commerce (e-commerce). Open banking reforms and the creation of Pix (a new electronic payments system) by the central bank will provide new opportunities in Brazil's highly concentrated system and promote financial inclusion by increasing bankarisation rates among the poor. Financial technology (fintech) activities have the potential to boost competition and put pressure on margins, alleviating the adverse consequences of highly concentrated banking systems.
The Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, the central bank) has made inclusion and competition central pillars of its agenda. Since the launch of Pix in November 2020, about 134m user accounts have been registered, reflecting strong demand. The daily average volume of transactions is R5bn-6bn (US$930m-1.12bn). In February 2021 alone, more than 270m Pix transactions were made, according to BCB data. On its own, Pix, which allows individuals to make instant digital payments and money transfers for free (companies pay a small fee), will dent traditional bank profits by almost eliminating fees gathered on wire transfers, still widely used in Brazil. Conversely, Brazil's unbanked population, estimated at 45m-60m people, should shrink as a result, piggybacking on a general shift to digital payment and banking services during the pandemic (over 40m Brazilians received their Covid-19 assistance payments digitally, through their Caixa Econômica Federal bank accounts). Rather than stoking zero-sum competition between brick-and-mortar operations and digital start-ups, the implementation of open banking should drive synergies between the two as traditional banks share data and collaborate with third-party institutions.
Looking ahead, open banking regulations are likely to follow, and the BCB governor, Roberto Campos Neto, has gone as far as to suggest the creation of a digital currency in 2022. Nonetheless, there are some risks to that should be considered. Fintech firms, which have been allowed to provide direct credit services since 2018, may not have the risk management systems and practices in place that incumbent financial firms have, which could present risks to financial stability. Moreover, increased digitalisation and connectivity exposes operators and consumers to cyber-security risk; active risk management is required so that measures related to cyber-security are commensurate with the underlying risk.
Long-term outlook: Methodology for long-term forecasts The time horizon for the detailed forecasts and analysis in the Country Forecast report is a five-year period. The Main report also carries a section on the long-term outlook, including projections of key macroeconomic and market size variables up to 2050. Depending on the indicator, average growth rates in a sub-period or values at select points in time are reported. Many companies make strategic business decisions over timeframes in excess of five years. The Economist Intelligence Unit's long-term projections will provide information to facilitate such decisions. Long-term forecasts and scenarios are also vital in understanding some of the big economic issues that will shape global business in the coming decades. We are well placed to build on and extend the five-year forecasts to produce long-term projections and scenarios because of the existing forward-looking analysis and models in the Country Forecast (in particular, the business environment rankings model). These are used to forecast some of the key drivers of long-run growth, as explained in detail below.
Growth projections The main building blocks for the long-term forecasts of key market and macroeconomic variables are long-run real GDP growth projections. We have estimated growth regressions that link real growth in GDP per head to a large set of growth determinants. The determinants of growth consist of the scope for convergence (based on initial GDP per worker at the start of a period); demographic variables; a set of policy variables (measuring the fiscal stance, openness to trade, and the government regulatory burden in product, credit and labour markets); a measure of institutional quality; geography (climate, location and the degree of primary export orientation); education levels and labour quality (as measured by mean years of schooling and life expectancy); the external economic environment (changes in the terms of trade); the level of development of information and communications technology (ICT); and historical legacies (history of independent statehood).
The regressions, which have high explanatory power for growth, allow us to forecast the long-term growth of real GDP per head for sub-periods up to 2050, on the basis of demographic projections and assumptions about the evolution of policy variables and other drivers of long-term growth.
Definitions of variables The dependent variable is GDPG: Average annual growth in real GDP per head, measured at national constant prices.
The independent variables include: LnGDPPL: The natural logarithm of GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity-PPP) per worker (that is, per population aged 15-65) in constant 1980 US dollars at the start of each decade. Expressed as an index, US$=1.
LnSCHOOL: The natural logarithm of the mean years of schooling of the population aged over 15 at the start of each decade. Missing values for some countries are filled in by estimating mean years of schooling on the basis of an equation relating mean years of schooling (where available) to gross primary school enrolment ten years previously, and to secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios five years previously.
LnLIFEEXP: The natural logarithm of life expectancy at birth at the start of each decade. This variable also enters the equation in squared form, reflecting diminishing returns to growth of increases in life expectancy at high levels.
OPEN: Updated Sachs-Warner index of openness-the fraction of years during each decade in which a country is rated as an open economy according to the following four criteria: (1) average tariff rates below 40%; (2) average quota and licensing coverage of imports of less than 40%; (3) a black-market exchange-rate premium that averaged less than 20%; and (4) no extreme controls (taxes, quotas, state monopolies) on exports.
INST: Index of institutional quality (on a scale of 1-10) that is an average of five sub-indices of measures of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, corruption, the risk of expropriation and the risk of government repudiation of contracts. Forecast values are based on corresponding indicators from our business environment rankings.
LABPOP: The difference between the growth rate of the working-age population (aged 15-65) and the growth rate of the total population in each decade.
TOT: The average annual rate of change of the terms of trade in a given decade.
GOVSAV: The average government savings ratio in each decade (current government revenue minus current government expenditure) expressed as a share of GDP.
TRADESH: The average share of trade (exports and imports of goods and services) in GDP, lagged by one decade to deal with the endogeneity of growth and trade.
GOVREG: An index on a scale of 1-10 of regulation of product, credit and labour markets. For forecast periods, the composite index is based on seven indicators from three categories of our business environment rankings model-from Policy towards private enterprise (ease of setting up new businesses, freedom to compete, price controls); from Financing (openness of the banking system, financial market distortions); and from Labour markets (restrictiveness of labour laws, wage regulation).
ICT: An index, on a scale of 1-10, of the development of information and communications infrastructure.
Control variables include PRIMARY: share of the exports of primary products in GDP at the start of a decade; TROPIC: percentage of the land area within a country that has a tropical climate; COLONY: history of independent statehood-a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if a country was a colony before 1945; and, in some specifications, regional dummy variables.
Summary of findings As in other studies, income per head and human capital are found to be important determinants of growth, with the coefficient on the logarithm of GDP per worker suggesting a relatively modest pace of convergence. The measures of institutional quality and of government regulation enter significantly in all specifications. We found a strong positive impact on growth of government savings and openness in all specifications. The criteria for classifying countries as open are quite permissive. The crucial aspect of trade policy captured by the measure is that it is a high level of distortion, rather than modest levels, that is deleterious for growth. The trade share variable is also moderately significant. The openness index (which is more of a true measure of policy) is hardly affected by the inclusion of trade/GDP shares in the equation. The correlation of the two measures is only .26. Although a tropical climate is highly significant, as is the share of primary exports in GDP, other geographic indicators-such as access to the sea, distance from major growth centres and the proportion of the population residing near coastlines-were not significant. A colonial past (pre-1945) is found to have a significant negative impact on growth, even in more recent periods.
Productivity growth The forecasts of GDP growth, of capital stock growth (based on estimated investment shares and assumed depreciation rates) and of growth in labour supply (based on projections of working-age population and assumptions on labour force participation) yield labour productivity growth and total factor productivity growth forecasts. The latter utilise the growth accounting identity, GY=b*GK+c*GL+A, where GY is growth of real GDP, GK growth of the capital stock and GL growth of human capital (the labour force adjusted for changes in skills). "A" stands for growth in total factor productivity; "b" and "c" are the shares of capital and labour in income. Trade values are forecast on the basis of simple import (function of GDP and relative prices) and export functions. Forecast market exchange rates (that is, the differential between PPP and market exchange rates) depend on the differential in labour productivity growth between a country and the US.

Guide to the business rankings model Outline of the model The business rankings model measures the quality or attractiveness of the business environment in the 82 countries covered by Country Forecast using a standard analytical framework. It is designed to reflect the main criteria used by companies to formulate their global business strategies, and is based not only on historical conditions but also on expectations about conditions prevailing over the next five years. This allows The Economist Intelligence Unit to utilise the regularity, depth and detail of its forecasting work to generate a unique set of forward-looking business environment rankings on a regional and global basis.
The business rankings model examines 11 separate criteria or categories, covering the political environment, the macroeconomic environment, market opportunities, policy towards free enterprise and competition, policy towards foreign investment, foreign trade and exchange controls, taxes, financing, the labour market, infrastructure and technological readiness. Each category contains a number of indicators that are assessed by The Economist Intelligence Unit for the last five years and the next five years. The number of indicators in each category varies from five (foreign trade and exchange regimes) to 13 (political environment), and there are 91 indicators in total.
Almost half of the indicators are based on quantitative data (eg GDP growth), and are mostly drawn from national and international statistical sources for the historical period (2016-20) and from Economist Intelligence Unit assessments for the forecast period (2021-25). The other indicators are qualitative in nature (eg quality of the financial regulatory system), and are drawn from a range of data sources and business surveys adjusted by The Economist Intelligence Unit for 2016-20. All forecasts for the qualitative indicators covering 2021-25 are based on Economist Intelligence Unit assessments.
Sources used in the business rankings model include Akamai Technologies, State of the Internet; CIA, World Factbook; The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Risk Service, Country Commerce, Democracy Index, Risk Briefing; IMF, Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions; International Institute for Management Development, World Competitiveness Yearbook; International Labour Organisation, International Labour Statistics Yearbook; International Telecommunication Union, ICT Indicators Database; Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; UN Conference on Trade and Development, Ecommerce Index; World Bank, World Development Indicators, Doing Business; World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Index; World Intellectual Property Organisation, IP Facts and Figures.
Calculating the rankings The rankings are calculated in several stages. First, each of the 91 indicators is scored on a scale from 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good for business). The aggregate category scores are derived on the basis of simple or weighted averages of the indicator scores within a given category. These are then adjusted, on the basis of a linear transformation, to produce index values on a 1-10 scale. An arithmetic average of the ten category index values is then calculated to yield the aggregate business environment score for each country, again on a 1-10 scale.
The use of equal weights for the categories to derive the overall score reflects in part the theoretical uncertainty about the relative importance of the primary determinants of investment. Surveys of foreign direct investors' intentions yield widely differing results on the relative importance of different factors. Weighted scores for individual categories based on correlation coefficients of recent foreign direct investment inflows do not in any case produce overall results that are significantly different from those derived from a system based on equal weights.
For most quantitative indicators the data are arrayed in ascending or descending order and split into five bands (quintiles). The countries falling in the first quintile are assigned scores of 5, those falling in the second quintile score 4 and so on. The cut-off points between bands are based on the average of the raw indicator values for the top and bottom countries in adjacent quintiles. The 2016-20 ranges are then used to derive 2021-25 scores. This allows for intertemporal as well as cross-country comparisons of the indicator and category scores.
Measurement and grading issues The indices and rankings attempt to measure the average quality of the business environment over the entire historical or forecast period, not simply at the start or at the end of the period. Thus, in the forecast we assign an average grade to elements of the business environment over 2021-25, not to the likely situation in 2025 only.
The scores based on quantitative data are usually calculated on the basis of the numeric average for an indicator over the period. In some cases, the "average" is represented, as an approximation, by the recorded value at the mid-point of the period (2018 or 2023). In only a few cases is the relevant variable appropriately measured by the value at the start of the period (eg educational attainments). For one indicator (the natural resources endowment), the score remains constant for both the historical and forecast periods.

Full text: - Despite Venezuela's socioeconomic collapse and the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, to retain power throughout the 2021-25 forecast period. Mr Maduro's position will be supported primarily by his grip over a complex security apparatus and the opposition's lack of de facto power. On this basis, we expect continued deterioration of the economy, sustained outward migration, and a poorer and more violent Venezuela. Despite US sanctions (and their impact on oil production), the Maduro regime has managed internal dissent through a patronage system that rewards loyalty, as well as through its strict control over the security forces.
- The scale of the socioeconomic collapse and the elevated level of political instability will ensure that the Maduro regime continues to be challenged both economically and politically. In particular, there is a significant risk of regime change stemming from a possible breakdown in the patronage system that sustains the security forces' support of the regime. Under our baseline forecast, we assume that Mr Maduro will avoid this, as oil revenue should pick up from a trough in 2020. However, there are substantial risks to this assumption, given the scale of operational difficulties and the lack of incentives for investment in the Venezuelan oil industry.
- De facto dollarisation of the economy is expanding. Concurrently, the government has taken measures that have allowed the official exchange rate to float. These measures have aided price stability and therefore increased the availability of some basic goods. However, the measures are not a product of economic orthodoxy, but rather of policy decisions to ensure the regime's survival. We do not expect to see the comprehensive economic and institutional reforms that would be required to resolve Venezuela's economic crisis within the forecast period.

- Venezuela ranks 82nd of 82 countries in the global business environment rankings for 2021-25, having been 81st in the 2016-20 historical period, as the economic crisis is deepening despite minor improvements in some areas. Reforms to institutions, economic policy and the business environment are unlikely.

Country forecast overview: Venezuela's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Expansion of interventionist measures, including price controls. Corruption and selective application of regulations remain common and continue to undermine free competition.
2023-25: Contract rights remain weak, and red tape and ad hoc interventionism continue.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Most attempts to attract investment prove unsuccessful, owing to political and economic instability.
2023-25: Investment flows remain low amid ongoing economic volatility. Intellectual property protection and private property rights deteriorate.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Currency controls are weakened, but access to foreign currency remains limited.
2023-25: Efforts to remove trade and capital controls are taken on a gradual basis, and de facto dollarisation advances. Domestic supply of foreign currency improves as oil prices rise, albeit slowly.
Taxes 2021-22: Risk of further unrest and political instability reduces probability of tax increases, despite fiscal deficits. Severity of economic crisis precludes major rise in public spending.
2023-25: Tax system remains complex and unwieldy, but risk of discriminatory, ad hoc tax measures declines.
Financing 2021-22: Inflation remains high and concerns surrounding economic instability restrict financing to only short term.
2023-25: Economic adjustments take time to feed through to solid, sustainable growth in credit to private sector and development of capital markets. Long-term finance remains in short supply.
Labour market 2021-22: Labour laws add substantially to non-wage costs. Past emigration of skilled labour aggravates skills shortages.
2023-25: Labour-market rigidities persist despite some increase in flexibility of hiring and firing practices.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Underinvestment in water network and electricity grid leads to continued rationing and unpredictable blackouts.
2023-25: Investors remain highly cautious about committing to long-term capital projects. Infrastructure deteriorates even further.
Technological readiness 2021-22: E-government services remain almost non-existent. Deteriorating infrastructure limits adoption of new technologies. Telecommunications sector is opened to foreign investment, but with little interest.
2023-25: Limited regulatory capacity and years of underinvestment continue to restrict internet and mobile coverage.

a Economist Intelligence Unit estimates.
Background: From 1958 until the mid-1990s, two parties-Acción Democrática and the Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente-alternated in power. Frequent economic crises and endemic corruption eventually led to a collapse in support for both parties and culminated in the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant-colonel and leader of a failed coup in 1992. Mr Chávez's policy programme exacerbated political polarisation, but several attempts to remove him from power before his death in March 2013 proved unsuccessful. His chosen successor, Nicolás Maduro, has seen his own popularity plummet as his macroeconomic mismanagement, combined with strict sanctions on trade from the US, has plunged the country into a state of economic collapse.
Political structure: Although Venezuela is nominally a federal republic with separation of powers, the ruling Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) has systematically eroded institutions. In December 2015 the opposition coalition, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, won control of the unicameral National Assembly. In January 2016 the politicised Supreme Court declared the legislature to be in contempt of court, blocking all subsequent legislation. Since August 2017 a PSUV-only Constituent Assembly granted itself a remit over all legislative matters, becoming the country's de facto legislature and sidelining the National Assembly. In December 2020 the PSUV and its allies regained control of the legislature in an election that was widely regarded as rigged.
Policy issues: The most pressing policy issue is the need to stabilise an economy that remains mired in a long-standing economic crisis. The monetisation of vast public deficits has created an ever-increasing excess of domestic currency, triggering hyperinflation. Mismanagement of PDVSA (the state-owned oil company and originator of practically all foreign-currency inflows into the country) has resulted in a sharp contraction of oil production. This has restricted foreign-currency supply, giving way to currency controls, the rationing of imports, and the emergence of black markets for both foreign currency and basic goods. The scarcity of foreign exchange has also led to arrears on most of the external debt issued by sovereign and state-owned firms.
Taxation: The top corporate tax rate is 34% for non-oil companies and 50% for oil firms. The value-added tax (VAT) rate stands at 12%.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus fell to US$10.2bn in 2019 as a long-term decline in oil exports deepened. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the trade account deteriorated further in 2020, shifting to a deficit of US$3.2bn

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the civic-military regime, led by Nicolás Maduro of the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV, the Chavistas), to remain in power throughout the 2021-25 forecast period, despite its failure to stem a long-running socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis. A number of factors underpin our forecast; particularly significant is the regime's strict control over the military, the police and paramilitary forces. This control, which depends on a patronage system that rewards the loyalty of high-ranking officials, will allow the regime to manage internal dissent.
Following a sham legislative election in December 2020, in which the Chavistas retook control of the National Assembly, the regime enjoys virtually unchecked control over all the levers of power. Meanwhile, the domestic opposition, led by Juan Guaidó (the former head of the legislature and self-declared interim president), has been left scrambling without a clear path forward. The opposition's decision to boycott the December election has left it without a voice in any major government institution. Before losing control of the National Assembly, the opposition moved to unilaterally extend its mandate by one year. However, with many lawmakers abstaining from the vote out of fear of reprisals from the Maduro regime, and with key international players including the EU no longer recognising Mr Guaidó as the interim president (but rather as the main opposition leader), the opposition's attempt to extend its mandate lacks clear support and legitimacy.
In practice, the fallout from the election changes little in terms of policymaking; Mr Maduro has long used the executive's sweeping powers, as well as his influence over the highly politicised judiciary, to approve his policy agenda. However, retaking control of the National Assembly is significant insofar as it all but erases any threat that the Guaidó-led opposition might pose to Mr Maduro.
There is, nonetheless, a high degree of risk attached to our forecast that Mr Maduro will remain in power. The uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19), diminished oil rents-resulting from severe mismanagement of the sector, and more recently from US sanctions-and persistent goods shortages all present hefty challenges to the survival of the regime. In our view, there are three main paths to a change of government: military intervention, a negotiated transition or some sort of internal coup. We believe that the prospect of military action by the US or Colombia is very low. Notwithstanding efforts by the US to increase multilateral engagement, a negotiated transition would also be difficult, as trust issues between the two sides are insurmountable. Bearing this in mind, we believe that the most likely scenario for regime change is an internal coup. The regime's main weakness is the fragility of its internal finances. Its patronage system is crucial for sustaining its security apparatus and resisting social unrest. US sanctions will exacerbate the already poor macroeconomic environment and limit the country's ability to draw in US dollar finance. The regime will continue to benefit from funds from drug-trafficking and illegal mining activities, but a lack of hard currency could prove fatal to the patronage system, and will test the regime's ability to maintain cohesion among its ranks and control over the security apparatus. The regime's liquidity problems-along with the deepening socioeconomic and humanitarian crisis-could therefore prompt putsch attempts in the near term.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch Venezuela held a legislative election in December 2020 to select the 277 members of the unicameral National Assembly. The vote, which was boycotted by most opposition parties, was widely regarded as being neither free nor fair. The results were therefore unsurprising; the Gran Polo Patriótico, an electoral alliance dominated by the PSUV, won an overwhelming supermajority of 256 seats in the legislature.
Next on the electoral calendar are regional elections (to elect governors and state legislative assemblies), due by end-2021, followed by local elections (to elect mayors and councillors) in 2022. However, we now believe that the local elections will be brought forward to 2021, following a move in early March by lawmakers to repeal the law that regularises the constitutional terms of state and local governments. In a context where the PSUV already controls more than 85% of governorships and mayoralties, the political benefits of consolidating power at the sub-national level will be modest. Consequently, we believe that the regime will endeavour to use negotiations over electoral conditions as a step towards gaining international legitimacy and some degree of sanctions relief. At present, we remain sceptical that the regime will acquiesce to conditions that would ensure a level playing field, and we consider that prospects for sanctions relief are dim.
Against this backdrop, the key question for the opposition will be whether to participate in elections, with the game rigged against it. We believe that some factions are likely to participate-even under unfair conditions-in a bid to make inroads into a political system from which they have been shut out. However, any gains will be modest and will not alter the fundamental balance of power.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations The Maduro regime's main foreign policy challenge will centre on managing its combative ties with the US. The administration led by the former US president, Donald Trump (2017-21), instituted several rounds of crippling oil sanctions as part of a "maximum pressure" campaign designed to undermine the regime's finances (and therefore its patronage system) in order to force Mr Maduro to hold free and fair elections. Although the aggressive sanctions policy did not produce its intended outcome, it did accelerate the decline of Venezuela's oil industry. Mr Maduro will look to reset ties with the US under the new president, Joe Biden, but we expect little progress. US policy towards Venezuela has bipartisan support in the US, and Mr Biden is unlikely to provide significant sanctions relief absent major political compromises and commitments to democratic reforms from the Maduro regime (which remain highly improbable). Any changes to US sanctions policy will therefore be only on humanitarian grounds, aimed at improving the lives of the poorest Venezuelans. For instance, we expect the Biden administration to reverse course on recently instated sanctions on crude-for-diesel swaps, which are mainly used by the regime to shore up diesel supplies for power generation, agricultural activity, water pumps and public transport.
Iran recently became Mr Maduro's main international backer. In 2020 Iran sent more than 2.5m barrels of petrol to Venezuela (in exchange for gold shipments) to alleviate the country's severe petrol shortages. An additional 677,000 barrels have already been sent in 2021 (mostly in exchange for jet fuel).
Venezuela's other major allies, including Russia and China, seem unwilling to provide the financing-amounting to tens of billions of US dollars per year-required to stabilise the economy and secure the long-term future of PDVSA (the state oil company). Mr Maduro has openly courted both countries but has had little success in securing finance for investment.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends The Maduro regime's immediate policy priorities will be to contain the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak and to halt a long-running economic collapse. In January, in order to address the community spread of the coronavirus, the regime reintroduced the "Fórmula 7+7 Plus" strategy, which involves alternating between a week of tighter restrictions (when non-essential shops and services are closed) and a week of more relaxed restrictions (when those businesses may open). However, this will not prevent Venezuela's decrepit medical infrastructure from being overwhelmed, and the regime will therefore be forced to implement even stricter mobility restrictions intermittently. Concurrently, efforts by the regime to procure vaccines are making little headway. So far, Venezuela has received 200,000 doses of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine and 500,000 doses of China's Sinopharm vaccine. Mr Maduro says that a total of 10m Sputnik V doses will arrive this year, but the Russian authorities have not confirmed a purchase agreement. The government hopes to obtain 1.4m-2.4m vaccine doses through the WHO-led COVAX Facility, but funding issues and the politicisation of vaccine distribution will hinder procurement. Against this backdrop, we do not expect that enough doses of the vaccine will be distributed to have a significant impact on local transmission until 2023.
Addressing the long-running economic decline will be a similarly difficult task. Mr Maduro will continue a process of gradual economic liberalisation in order to draw in private investment. In October 2020 the regime promulgated an anti-blockade law, which gives the executive branch the unchecked authority to sign confidential new deals with private firms and countries (in an attempt to skirt international sanctions). In November the regime used the law to sell Agropatria, a state-owned agricultural firm, to Grupo Agrollano, a private company of unknown origin. We expect that the regime will similarly seek to reprivatise a number of other businesses that had been expropriated by Mr Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chávez (1999-2013), but were run aground by cronyism and mismanagement. The regime will also encourage greater private-sector participation in the oil industry, but it will refrain from outright privatisation of PDVSA. These efforts are unlikely to yield significant results; even assuming that the regime is able to sidestep financial sanctions, it will struggle to attract new investment, given the abysmal business environment and a lack of confidence in the rule of law.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy The authorities have not published complete data on the fiscal accounts since 2011. However, we expect that a high level of inefficient current expenditure, combined with an extremely weak revenue intake, will keep the budget deficit wide and the public debt/GDP ratio astronomical throughout the 2021-25 forecast period. The sovereign's default on most of its interest and principal repayments will curb government spending. The regime relies heavily on monetisation to fund its deficits, driving hyperinflation and the rationing of foreign currency. Money printing will continue to finance the government's deficits in 2021-25. The sovereign is in arrears on virtually all of its interest and principal repayments, and we do not expect any debt restructuring in 2021-25. Moreover, the existence of considerable off-balance-sheet debt financing-mainly PDVSA-issued debt and development funds from China-understates the true size of total public liabilities.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy Monetary policy will remain subservient to fiscal policy, as the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV, the central bank) continues to print money to finance the government's gaping budget deficits. The BCV has, in recent years, taken steps to control growth of monetary aggregates. For instance, in early 2019 it lifted the cash reserve ratio (CRR) to 100%; although it has relaxed the CRR slightly since that peak, as at January 2021 it remained at an extremely high 85%. Moreover, far from taming inflation, these measures have led to the complete destruction of private-sector credit; in January the stock of real private-sector credit was less than 1% of what it was four years ago.
These factors have accelerated the trend towards greater use of US dollars in the economy. According to private-sector estimates, two-thirds of all financial transactions are now made in US dollars. This share is likely to rise further following Mr Maduro's January announcement that banks would be authorised to expand the use of foreign-currency bank accounts. The regime has even allowed private companies to issue debt in hard currency in order to raise finance; in November 2020 Ron Santa Teresa became the first company in more than two decades to issue dollar-denominated bonds (worth US$300,000) on the Caracas Stock Exchange. Although progress will be gradual, we believe that Venezuela is ultimately headed towards overall de facto dollarisation.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth After an estimated contraction in real GDP of 31% in 2020 (and a cumulative contraction of almost 77% since 2013), we forecast marginally positive growth of 0.7% in 2021. GDP is now strongly correlated with oil production. Having plummeted to an average of 500,000 barrels/day in 2020-its lowest level in several decades-crude production will stabilise in 2021 as global energy demand starts to recover. PDVSA's ability to ramp up oil production more significantly will be limited, given the absence of any active oil rigs in the country. Moreover, prospects for investment are bleak: at present, Venezuela's average break-even price is about US$15-20/barrel. However, US sanctions on the regime raise the risks involved in dealing with Venezuela, forcing the country to offer a hefty discount on its crude. This means that, at current market prices, Venezuela is making only a limited profit (its oil basket traded at an estimated US$43/b in February). That said, there are some upside risks to our assumptions. Oil prices are rising, giving potential buyers stronger incentives to find ways around US sanctions. Moreover, even in the absence of active rigs, it is possible that PDVSA could extract more crude than we anticipate from existing oil wells. For its part, the non-oil economy will see little improvement, especially as an uncontrolled pandemic limits prospects for services activities.
We expect growth to pick up in 2022, assuming that oil prices remain supportive and that producers continue to adapt to post-sanctions export markets. However, serious operational problems (such as difficulties in obtaining equipment for repairs and finding qualified staff), a limited pool of buyers of Venezuelan crude and the weak long-term fundamentals of the oil market will cause growth to taper off towards the end of our forecast period. The non-oil economy will also make modest gains in 2022-25, assuming that continued dollarisation supports relative macroeconomic stability. Nonetheless, we expect that Venezuela's GDP (in real terms) will be only about half its 2018 level, even in 2025.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation A severely reduced domestic goods supply, constraints on import capacity and the monetisation of large public deficits will impede the disinflationary process in 2021-25. The regime has shown little inclination to take on the fiscal and macroeconomic reforms that would address the root causes of inflation. It has, however, lent its support to an ongoing process of de facto dollarisation, which will help to ease price pressures over time.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates Hyperinflation will sustain bolívar depreciation in 2021. Given incessant inflation and its effect on nominal values, we believe that another currency redenomination (as in March 2018) or a new currency is a strong possibility. Even though a number of currency regulations officially remain on the books, the regime has largely stopped enforcing them in its recent embrace of dollarisation. Although a black market for US dollars continues to operate, the premium is modest compared with previous years. On March 18th the black-market exchange rate stood at BsS1,835,391:US$1, only marginally above the official exchange rate of BsS1,804,994:US$1.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector Balance-of-payments pressures will remain severe in 2021-25, contributing to goods shortages and economic inequities. Foreign reserves stood at US$6.3bn in February-their lowest level in three decades. The steep decline in reserves, which has been several years in the making, reflects poor policymaking and a lack of economic diversification in the country's external sector.
Under our baseline forecast, we expect reserves to rise modestly over the forecast period, reaching US$8.2bn by end-2025. We expect this increase to be driven entirely by trends on the current account, as Venezuela's access to foreign capital will remain extremely limited. We expect the current-account balance to shift from an estimated deficit of 7.2% of GDP in 2020 to a surplus of 1.8% of GDP in 2021. Thereafter, it will remain in surplus, averaging 2.6% of GDP in 2022-25. Our forecast rests on the assumption that export earnings will pick up from a nadir in 2020 as international oil prices recover and the country steps up trade with new buyers in Asia. We also expect that workers' remittances from abroad will play a crucial role in propping up the current-account balance as Venezuelan emigrants are gradually absorbed into the labour markets in their host countries.

Full text: - The tenure of the president, Muhammadu Buhari, will last until 2023 and be blemished by a decline in living standards caused by recession in 2020, a rise in unemployment and (paradoxically) high, policy-induced inflation.
- The administration will struggle to tackle high levels of poverty and the country's ethnic and religious divisions. This potent mixture has the potential to cause protests that halt the advancement of pro-market reforms.
- A decline in living standards under Mr Buhari, whose tenure has been marked by two recessions, as well as frustrations over pervasive insecurity and poor governance means that the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) is forecast to win the 2023 election.
- The Economist Intelligence Unit expects some reregulation of electricity pricing under a PDP government. Although this would be bad news for the power sector, we do not expect a return to distortive pricing in the petroleum sector.
- Official currency transactions will migrate over to a more market-led exchange rate used by investors and exporters, simplifying the multiple exchange-rate regime. However, the naira will be overvalued by the central bank and subject to periodic corrections, as expected in 2021 and 2025.
- Large recurrent government spending commitments will result in another substantial fiscal deficit in 2021, by Nigerian standards. The budget shortfall will then broadly edge down as external conditions improve, the domestic economy picks up and revenue rises.
- Given a crippling infrastructure deficit, high inflation, instability in crucial agricultural regions and high unemployment, we expect growth of just 1.2% in 2021. Only when the exchange rate and inflation stabilise will there be a more meaningful recovery.
- Inflation will stay high in 2021 as devaluation of the naira, instability in agricultural growing areas, monetary loosening and exchange-rate restrictions for staple imports feed into consumer prices. Monetary tightening is expected to start from 2022 to tackle the issue.
- We expect a current-account deficit for a third consecutive year in 2021 (something that has not been seen since the 1990s), despite an increase in world oil prices. The current account will return to surplus in 2022-25 as the oil market recovers and petrol import volumes decline.

- Nigeria's business environment score worsens slightly for the forecast period (2021-25) as the macroeconomic and security environment remains highly challenging. As a result, its global and regional rankings fall.

Country forecast overview: Nigeria's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: The overarching policy objective is to promote self-sufficiency and local industrialisation through protectionism. As a result, the non-oil sector is be largely shielded from external competition.
2023-25: A new government (which is likely to be opposition-led) is likely to remain wary of opening up the economy.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: A reduction is made to royalties for offshore oil activity introduced in 2020 in an attempt to prevent divestment from oil majors operating in Nigeria. Outside the oil sector, concerns over the foreign-exchange regime deter investment.
2023-25: Energy firms remain hesitant about increasing their presence in a difficult operating environment, especially onshore, but concerted efforts are made to clean up the national oil company (which is in joint venture with oil majors).
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Movement of goods is highly regulated to prevent smuggling, but people will be allowed to cross land borders once the coronavirus pandemic is brought under control.
2023-25: A spread between the official and the parallel-market exchange rates persists as oil prices rise and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is again able to defend an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxes 2021-22: The focus on boosting tax compliance intensifies, but the weak state of the economy and upcoming elections prevent tax increases.
2023-25: Value-added tax (VAT) is raised from 7.5% to cut the budget deficit amid persistently high debt-servicing costs.
Financing 2021-22: The government returns to the sovereign debt market, and capital projects are restarted.
2023-25: Credit conditions become tighter as the CBN moves to control high inflation.
The labour market 2021-22: Employers face major problems, including a shortage of skilled manual workers, restrictive visa regulations and poor health indicators.
2023-25: Employers continue to struggle to find qualified staff; unemployment stays high and the labour market loose.
Infrastructure 2021-22: A reduction in consumer subsidies (for petrol) frees up resources for higher public capital investment, but government spending remains small relative to the size of the economy, at under 7%.
2023-25: A large private refinery starts up, reducing Nigeria's near-total dependency on imported petrol.
Technological readiness 2021-22: Nigeria retains a vibrant technology sector for an economy at its stage of development, but infrastructure is weak outside urban hubs.
2023-25: Research spending remains low compared with global averages, but some home-grown technology firms looking to adapt global technology trends to the Nigerian market continue to do well.

Background: Nigeria gained independence in 1960, and multi-party democracy was restored in 1999 after a protracted period of military rule. The first two presidential elections (in 1999 and 2003) were both won by a former military ruler turned civilian politician, Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Obasanjo was unable to change the constitution to allow him to serve a third term in office, so in the 2007 election power passed to his handpicked successor, Umaru Yar'Adua. After Mr Yar'Adua's death in May 2010, his vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, assumed the presidency and went on to win the 2011 presidential election. In 2015 Mr Jonathan was defeated by Muhammadu Buhari, who secured a second term in early 2019.
Political structure: Under the constitution adopted in May 1999, a strong executive presidency appoints a Federal Executive Council, comprising government ministers and ministers of state from each of Nigeria's 36 states. The executive is accountable to the bicameral National Assembly. Political parties tend to lack clear ideologies; in practice, personal and ethnic ties predominate. The People's Democratic Party (Mr Jonathan's party) had historically been the predominant political force, but the merger in 2013 of three large opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress gave them, with Mr Buhari at the helm, the reach that they needed to take power in 2015 and secure re-election in 2019.
Policy issues: Successive governments have sought to improve macroeconomic stability and develop the nation's dire infrastructure, with mixed results. The government is struggling to end insecurity in various parts of the country. These tensions are stoked by the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment. Management of the naira by the authorities is a contentious issue, with important subsidy programmes hinging on an overvalued official exchange rate.
Taxation: Corporate profits in most non-oil sectors are taxed at 30%. Planned changes to the tax system for the oil and gas sector have been repeatedly delayed, creating uncertainty. Most other taxes are low, reflecting the fact that most revenue comes from the oil sector, with the total tax take small as a share of GDP. With oil prices far lower than they were in 2010-14, it is likely that amendments to consumer taxes will be made, specifically in value-added tax (VAT, currently 7.5%).
Foreign trade: Exports are dominated by oil. The slump in oil prices from the second half of 2014 wiped out what had historically been a large current-account surplus. The non-oil export base has been rendered globally uncompetitive by massive infrastructure deficiencies.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability The Economist Intelligence Unit expects the president, Muhammadu Buhari, to stay in power until his second (and final) term expires in 2023. He will be under immense pressure to stabilise Nigeria, but myriad security threats will prove unmanageable. The military and police are overstretched and unable to tackle simultaneous security crises. Emergencies will be triaged, with military resources deployed to whichever is considered the most pressing.
This shaky system will keep the government in power but leave the country highly dysfunctional and, in many regions, extremely insecure. The government will remain embroiled in a long drawn-out conflict with Boko Haram and Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP), two Islamist terrorist groups firmly ensconced in north-eastern Nigeria. As the region is a stronghold of the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), the president will be committed to asserting control, irrespective of how difficult this will be. Boko Haram and ISWAP will be aggressively countered, but the north-east-particularly Borno state-will remain a low-level conflict zone, and the campaign there will divert security forces away from other insecure parts of Nigeria.
The military and police will be poorly equipped to suppress pervasive banditry and kidnapping, particularly in the north-west. There is also evidence of terrorist groups operating more openly in that region, highlighted by recent mass school kidnappings. Over 2021-25 the north-west could begin to resemble the highly insecure north-east as, essentially, a "no-go" zone.
One hotspot that will remain neglected is the agricultural Middle Belt, where violent conflict between farmers and herdsmen over increasingly scarce land and water resources has killed thousands in recent years. Formal land-titling is often touted as a solution to the crisis; however, as it would in effect alienate one group from communal holdings in favour of another, it would prove too contentious. As with the north-east, the direct effects of the conflict will be localised, but the entire country will feel the fallout in the form of reduced local food production and high prices.
Nigeria's federal government has weathered severe but localised (largely rural) security problems for several decades without overall stability being jeopardised, but the near- to medium-term outlook is made more uncertain by the scars of recession in 2020 and by rising levels of unemployment and poverty. Declining living standards arguably exacerbated and prolonged protests over police brutality that broke out in cities across southern Nigeria in October 2020. Avoiding a repeat of these will be paramount for Mr Buhari's administration, and a pro-market reform agenda that made impressive headway in 2020, with subsidies reduced on fuel and electricity, is judged to have slowed. Should protests break out again, concessions can be expected.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch The next national elections are due in 2023. In the most recent presidential election, in 2019, the candidates of both main parties were from the north, and custom dictates that the candidates in 2023 will be from the south. This should lead to an improvement on the abysmally low turnout in 2019 in the south, which is a stronghold of the main opposition party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP). Frustration with high prices, declining living standards and perpetual instability will be directed at the APC, giving the PDP a winning edge.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations Nigeria will remain a major player in Africa given its size, but its domestic challenges tend to keep policymakers inwardly focused. Land borders that were closed to goods since late 2019 have reopened, but Nigeria's government is unlikely to show much enthusiasm over encouraging regional trade, beyond its obligations under the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCTFA). The trade pact compels Nigeria to eliminate 97% of tariff lines over the next five to ten years. This deadline will not be met early, given high prices in Nigeria and declining external competitiveness for industries that could otherwise benefit from regional market access.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends Nigeria's government and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will aggressively promote local industry, but some elements of policy are contradictory and will contribute to macroeconomic imbalances. An important theme for inward investment will be management of the naira. A ban on foreign-exchange access for imports of certain manufactures and agricultural goods (covering 45 items) is being enforced to protect local industry and support the currency, but has some major flaws. Most notably, restrictions are elevating inflation and undermining the currency regime through sustained real effective exchange-rate (REER) appreciation. Despite this, currency restrictions are expected to last throughout the forecast period, being central to the CBN's economic development strategy.
The government has announced that henceforth it will conduct official foreign-exchange transactions using the Nigerian autonomous foreign-exchange fixing (NAFEX) rate, which was previously used only by exporters and investors. This is tantamount to devaluation and has been touted by officials as the adoption of a "market-determined" currency. However, a wide spread between the NAFEX and parallel-market rates confirms overvaluation of the former, and the CBN continues to insist that the structure of the foreign-exchange market is unaltered. The adoption of a fully market-determined currency is not expected in 2021-25, with the CBN adamant that such a move would lead to an overshoot and an inflationary spiral.
Faced with hard currency shortages in 2020, the CBN has allowed a backlog of foreign-exchange orders from investors and importers to accumulate. Market turnover has recently edged up, but the backlog will only be cleared slowly in 2021 to modulate capital outflows, further undermining the currency regime's reputation. A pattern of inflexibility by the CBN in the wake of oil price shocks (with similarly severe foreign-exchange shortages in 2015-16) will have a long-term impact on confidence, and partly explains our projection for foreign direct investment to equal 1% of GDP or less throughout the forecast period.
Over time the contradiction between protectionism and the AfCFTA's principles will become increasingly conspicuous, but we do not expect an immediate change in strategy given that non-tariff barriers will be phased out over several years. Developing manufacturing and agriculture is likely to be viewed as a means of preparing for the eventual elimination of tariffs, with currency controls expected to play a role in hastening the process. However, an infrastructure deficit, REER appreciation and instability in agricultural heartlands mean that Nigeria will struggle to acquire new comparative advantages in 2021-25, leaving the fiscal and external accounts and the naira exposed to oil price swings.
Price controls will be another important area of economic policy. Astonishing strides towards the deregulation of petrol and electricity pricing were made in 2020, but electricity price increases have already been scaled down in the face of political pressure, and the same process is beginning with petrol subsidies, now that crude oil prices are rising. A permanent reinstatement of petrol price controls is made unlikely by a new Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) that we expect to be passed in 2021. The legislation is likely to streamline sector-wide regulation in the process of creating a new, profit-oriented national oil company, which by definition could not be weighed down by subsidising the retail market. The downstream industry should become commercially viable from this reorganisation of the sector, allowing Nigeria to wean itself off petrol imports, with a new 650,000-barrels/day refinery expected to come on stream in 2022. The PIB will also encourage upstream oil investment by making fiscal terms clearer for multinationals. For the PIB to make sense, petrol price subsidies will need to end before it is enacted. However, we do not expect the sustained electricity price increases that are needed for the power sector to become financially sound, and pricing in the sector remains regulated de jure. Electricity undersupply will therefore continue to hinder industrialisation.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy We expect the fiscal account to stay in deficit in 2021-25. Receipts from crude oil make up more than 50% of the federal government's retained income, and an average international oil price of US$64.3/barrel in 2021-25 will be insufficient to balance the budget. The federal government's tax take is among the worlds lowest, owing to widespread evasion and a large informal sector. Value-added tax (VAT, currently of 7.5%) is viewed by the authorities as the most effective means of increasing fiscal receipts, and we expect three equal VAT rate increases, taking the rate to 15% by 2025. The first is expected in 2022, prior to the next elections but seemingly inevitable given a rising debt load. Further increases are expected in 2024 and 2025. Even then, our federal revenue projection peaks at just 4.9% of GDP in 2024, which also factors in no fuel subsidies after 2021 (costs for which are deducted from revenue). Set against this, high debt-servicing costs, a large public wage bill and healthcare commitments-including procurement of coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccines-will elevate expenditure. Capital investment will also be emphasised to compensate for the ending of petrol subsidies. The government justified price deregulation by promising to invest the savings in infrastructure and will be under pressure to match rhetoric with action (assuming that the PIB is enacted and subsidies end in 2021).
Overall, we expect the fiscal deficit to decline to 3.2% of GDP in 2021 (from 3.7% of GDP in 2020) as international oil prices rise. VAT hikes will lead the ratio to fall to 2.5% of GDP in 2024, but a fall in average international oil prices in 2025 will lead to the shortfall widening to 2.8% of GDP in 2025. The government has raised its public debt limit to 40% of GDP to incorporate higher budget shortfalls over the medium-term and to accommodate securitisation of CBN deficit financing as long-term debt. We expect the ratio to reach only 32% of GDP in 2025.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy The CBN will fail to keep inflation below a target ceiling of 9%, and its policy decisions are likely to be erratic. In 2020, given a probable recession and limited fiscal firepower, it decided to cut the policy rate by a cumulative 100 basis-points. The rate has been kept at 11.5% despite an upward trend in annual inflation (which reached 17.3% in February). The strategy in place is to boost the supply side of the economy and thereby control inflation. We believe this is misguided; high and rising inflation will frustrate an economic recovery, and issues such as inadequate public infrastructure, direct funding of the fiscal deficit, hard-currency shortages and rampant instability need to be addressed before the supply side can moderate the price level. We expect high inflation to persist, compelling the CBN to raise interest rates in 2022, despite still-weak economic growth. There is a distinct risk (to this forecast) of the CBN tightening earlier, given escalating inflation, but we expect a reversion to price subsidies in early/mid-2021 to provide space for the CBN to hold steady. Easing will resume only in 2024, when inflation has fallen appreciably.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth The economy is expected to exit recession in 2021 as the impact of lockdown in 2020 fades, but high inflation will impede improvements in business sentiment and dampen real purchasing power amid high levels of unemployment (at about one-third of the labour force) and low nominal wage growth. Fiscal stimulus will be an inadequate counterforce given budget constraints, and loosened monetary policy will pressurise the naira, creating a scarcity of foreign exchange and further undermining macroeconomic stability. Oil export volumes will rise slightly, however, as quotas agreed by OPEC+ (comprising OPEC and a group of non-OPEC countries) are relaxed, encouraging growth of 1.2% in 2021.
The CBN is expected to tighten monetary policy from 2022, which will circumscribe the nascent economic recovery, but the exchange rate should stabilise and cause inflation to ease, allowing for stronger growth. As non-business financial penetration is low, private consumption will recover alongside disinflation even as interest rates rise. New refining capacity is also expected to come on stream in earnest, boosting net exports (some output will be for the regional market, and Nigeria's import dependency for fuel will decline). Crude oil exports are also expected to increase as prices rise, resulting in growth of 3% in 2022. As refinery output continues to ramp up, crude oil exports rise, inflation falls and real spending power recovers, growth will pick up to an annual average of 3.8% in 2023-24. However, these rates of growth are well below potential. The economy will continue to lack dynamism owing to high interest rates, low foreign direct investment, high unemployment, pervasive instability in agricultural regions and infrastructure deficiencies, particularly regarding stable power supply. A more challenging year is forecast for 2025 as oil prices fall and macroeconomic uncertainty rises, with growth slipping to 1.7%.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation In 2021 we expect inflation to average 17%, with increases on both core and non-core levels. Although our projection for oil prices has increased, a covert return to subsidies over part of the year will delay the impact. High inflation will nonetheless stem from past increases at the pump and the lingering pass-through of raised electricity tariffs in 2020, foreign-exchange restrictions on various imported goods, including staple foods, and devaluation of the naira. Assuming that the exchange rate stabilises and that the CBN tightens monetary policy, we expect the annual inflation rate to fall to an average of 10% in 2024. Conflict in the Middle Belt-Nigeria's breadbasket-foreign-exchange controls on imported goods and an eventual return to pricing petrol at the market rate will prevent a faster fall. Currency devaluation in 2025 will cause the average rate to increase again, to 12.5% that year.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates Nigeria's government has declared that official transactions will shift from the CBN rate (N379:US$1) to the NAFEX rate (N409:US$1 in late March), essentially consolidating the two via devaluation and in effect making the official rate obsolete. The NAFEX rate-established in 2017-is more flexible than the official rate but is nonetheless tightly managed by the CBN and overvalued, as evidenced by a parallel rate of N483:US$1.
Foreign reserves have been declining since January, and the CBN is yet to clear a backlog of hard-currency orders, indicating that the draw-down is partly being caused by a net outflow on current transactions, despite firmer oil prices. REER appreciation is a leading factor behind the external imbalance, and in the CBN's defence of reserves, we expect an adjustment to N422:US$1 by end-year. Following this we expect the current account to return to surplus in 2022-24, while monetary tightening in Nigeria will attract hot-money inflows. This should allow the CBN to keep the exchange rate broadly stable. Unceasing currency misalignment means that REER appreciation will nonetheless resurface and, with oil prices expected to slide again in 2025, another devaluation to N485:US$1 is expected.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector Assuming that devaluation moderates import demand for goods and services, and with global crude prices rising and inward transfers increasing as the global economy returns to growth, we expect a current-account deficit equal to 0.7% of GDP in 2021, down from 3.9% of GDP in 2020. Over the remainder of the forecast period we expect a small current-account surplus. Oil prices are projected to stay relatively high in 2022-23, supporting exports, while lower petroleum import volumes (as new domestic refinery capacity comes on stream) will constrain growth in the import bill (which is otherwise driven by real naira appreciation). Remittances from the large Nigerian diaspora should also recover to pre-pandemic levels, together with global GDP gains. This will all contribute to an annual average current-account surplus of 1% of GDP in 2022-24. The surplus will then narrow to 0.6% of GDP in 2025 as falling oil prices push down export earnings and continued REER appreciation encourages imports. The deficit in 2021 will be financed largely by debt inflows, with investment inflows limited by a dysfunctional foreign-exchange market.

Full text: - At the federal election on September 26th Angela Merkel will step down from her 16-year tenure as chancellor, and The Economist Intelligence Unit's core forecast is that a coalition will be formed between the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and The Greens, although risks to this have risen in recent weeks, as a variety of issues have dampened CDU support. We expect Markus Söder, the minister-president of Bavaria and leader of the CDU's sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), to be chosen as the CDU's chancellor-candidate.
- The top policy goal at present is to stimulate the economic recovery, which requires the pandemic to be controlled and vaccinations rolled out. Following the federal election, we expect policymaking to remain centrist, consensus-oriented and pro-Western, with a strong degree of continuity from the current administration. However, green policymaking will gain additional importance.
- After a 5.3% fall in real GDP in 2020, we forecast 3.5% growth in 2021, with the recovery gaining pace in the second half of the year and the economy returning to its 2019 size by 2022. Germany's large manufacturing sector, which has close export links with the rapidly recovering Chinese market, has proved a structural advantage during the pandemic. Forced savings, pent-up demand and an extended wage support scheme will boost private consumption once the lockdown ends. We forecast 2.4% annual average growth in 2022-25.
- Monetary and fiscal policy levers are being used to the full to limit the fallout from the crisis. The European Central Bank (ECB) has its policy rate set at -0.5%, and has expanded its net asset purchases to EUR1.85trn (over 10% of euro zone GDP) as part of its emergency programme.
- Germany's fiscal policy response in 2020 was the largest in Europe. Provisional data indicate a 4.8% of GDP deficit in 2020 (although this does not reflect substantial loan guarantees from the state development bank, KfW), and fiscal support will continue in 2021. We expect political pressure to ensure a return to fiscal consolidation from 2022, although rising pension and healthcare commitments will maintain small deficits (around 1% of GDP) in 2023-25.
- Germany's large-and often controversial-current-account surpluses will persist, owing to huge trade surpluses and large domestic savings invested abroad. The current-account surplus dipped slightly in 2020, to an estimated 6.9% of GDP, and we expect it to remain a broadly similar size as a share of GDP.

Country forecast overview: Germany's business environment at a glance Policy towards private enterprise and competition 2021-22: Significantly increased levels of state involvement in the economy decline only gradually, with pockets of market distortion. Likely review (and gradual tightening) of recently loosened EU state aid rules amid "level playing field" concerns.
2023-25: Limited prospects for reforming regulated service professions. State intervention pushes green and digital goals.
Policy towards foreign investment 2021-22: Policy still broadly welcoming towards greenfield foreign direct investment, but further tightening of foreign takeover rules and investment screening (particularly for non-EU inflows), amid concerns over intellectual property leakage.
2023-25: Geopolitical fallout from the pandemic encourages support for "strategic sectors" and industrial sovereignty.
Foreign trade and exchange controls 2021-22: Moderate bounce-back in world trade, but pressure on German export sector eases only gradually, given subdued global demand, ongoing US-China trade tensions and supply-chain disruption. EU-Mercosur trade deal delays continue.
2023-25: Steady decline in post-Brexit UK-EU crossborder trade. EU makes further gradual progress on bilateral trade deals.
Taxes 2021-22: No changes planned to headline tax rates. New modest tax-relief measures in 2021 (higher tax-free allowance and benefits) amid wider accommodative stance. Value-added tax (VAT) cut in hospitality sector extended to end-2022.
2023-25: Increased focus on environmental taxes. Comparatively high labour tax burden persists. Possible new digital taxes.
Financing 2021-22: Monetary policy remains highly accommodative, holding down banks' funding costs but also margins and profitability. Most business lending risk during the pandemic assumed by state-backed loan-guarantee schemes.
2023-25: Operating conditions for banks remain challenging. Ongoing efforts to attract financial services firms from the UK.
The labour market 2021-22: The Kurzarbeit wage-subsidy scheme remains in place until at least end-2021. Gradual tightening of some parameters.
2023-25: Risk of unequal scarring effects hitting less-protected labour market groups, such as young and older workers, and part-time female cohort. Rising structural challenges posed by ageing demographics and increasing share of migrant workers.
Infrastructure 2021-22: Higher investment in healthcare. Focus on improvements to rail network and digital infrastructure, such as ultra-fast broadband. Ongoing energy transition focuses on emissions and coal-usage reduction, and improvement of power grid.
2023-25: Steady rollout of policy measures to meet medium-term climate targets, including gradual phase-out of coal.
Technological readiness 2021-22: The government prioritises upgrading the country's digital infrastructure and investing in artificial intelligence.
2023-25: Efforts continue on the Industry 4.0 initiative, which focuses on upgrading manufacturing prowess through increased use of automation and connected systems. Increasing threat from cybercrime and cyber-espionage.

Background: The modern German state was founded in 1870. After the second world war (1939-45), Germany was divided into two parts: a liberal parliamentary democracy in the west and a totalitarian communist regime in the east. On October 3rd 1990, after the end of the Soviet Union's hegemony in central and eastern Europe, Germany was reunified.
Political structure: Germany is a federation of 16 states, or Länder, each of which has its own constitution, government and parliament. The states are primarily responsible for policing and education. The federal parliament comprises the directly elected Bundestag (the lower house) and the Bundesrat (the upper house) of representatives of the state governments. The federal chancellor, the head of the executive, is elected by the Bundestag and can be brought down only by the election of a successor. In March 2018 a grand coalition was once again formed, comprising the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD).
Policy issues: Short-term priorities focus on the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the resulting economic crisis and the rollout of the vaccination programme. Medium-term priorities include managing the transition of the automotive sector towards lower-emission vehicles; building industrial sovereignty and increasing the resilience of supply chains; managing rising tensions with Russia and China; implementing the rollout of fifth-generation (5G) technology, alongside continuing progress on the Industry 4.0 initiative; and transitioning the energy sector away from coal and nuclear power. Investment spending will increase in our forecast period (2021-25) compared with recent years.
Taxation: The federal corporation tax rate was cut from 25% to 15% in 2008. The effective corporate tax rate, including a municipal trade tax and a solidarity tax, is about 30-33%. The solidarity tax will be phased out from 2021. The top marginal personal income tax rate is 45%. Social security contributions are shared equally between employers and employees. The main value-added tax (VAT) rate is 19%, but was temporarily reduced to 16% during the second half of 2020.
Foreign trade: The goods trade surplus came to US$248.4bn in 2019, with export earnings at almost US$1.5trn and import costs at just over US$1.2trn. Germany's single largest goods export market is still the EU, but the country has been more successful than most in diversifying its markets and selling into fast-growing emerging markets over the past decade.

Outlook for 2021-25: Political stability Angela Merkel, the chancellor, leads a grand coalition comprising the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU)-along with its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU)-and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). At the September federal election, Mrs Merkel will step down from her 16-year tenure as chancellor-a turning-point for Germany's political landscape. However, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects policymaking to remain centrist and consensus-oriented.
Mrs Merkel's already high approval ratings rose during the coronavirus pandemic, with voters reassured by her calm demeanour, respect for scientific advice and recognised ability to manage crises. Germany's response to the public health crisis has been notable for stronger testing than its European peers, and for a more localised response-both made possible by the country's decentralised administrative structure. Excess hospital capacity also proved an advantage. However, the second wave over the winter has seen tensions rise between federal and state-level authorities over the appropriate level of restrictions. Social unrest and "pandemic fatigue" have also emerged, with protests against social distancing and mask-wearing rules, especially in Berlin, the capital. The latest extension of the lockdown, from March 7th to April 18th, proved chaotic, with tough "circuit-breaker" measures over Easter announced and then cancelled in quick succession, giving the sense of a loss of control.
We forecast that the September federal election will lead to a CDU/CSU-Greens coalition, with the CDU's chancellor candidate succeeding Mrs Merkel, although the risks to this have risen in recent weeks (see Election watch). Armin Laschet, the centrist governor of North Rhine-Westphalia, was chosen as the CDU's new party leader in January, but we do not expect him to become the party's chancellor candidate, given his poor poll ratings and disappointing results for the CDU in the first state elections under his tenure, in March. Markus Söder, the CSU leader and governor of Bavaria, has won increasing support among party members and the public during the pandemic. Although he has not yet declared his intention to run, we consider him the most likely choice. The decision on a candidate will be taken in the coming weeks, either by the CDU/CSU leadership or its parliamentary deputies.
We would expect a CDU/CSU-Green coalition to be less fractious than the current coalition, leading to increased political stability. The parties share similar views on economic and climate change policies, and on policy towards Russia. Frictions could be expected on fiscal policy and the controversial debt brake, however, where the CDU/CSU will seek a more hawkish stance, and relations with China, where The Greens will be more openly critical.
Outlook for 2021-25: Election watch The next federal election is scheduled for September 26th, and will result in a change in chancellor for the first time since 2005. In the state elections on March 14th the CDU performed poorly and failed to oust the popular incumbent minister-presidents: Winfried Kretschmann (The Greens) in Baden-Württemberg and Malu Dreyer (SPD) in Rhineland-Palatinate. The CDU/CSU's standing with voters was also damaged in March by the revelation of a corruption scandal around mask procurement in 2020, and a growing sense that the federal government has failed to get a grip on the pandemic's second wave and is presiding over a sluggish vaccination rollout. In the wake of the state elections, public support for the CDU/CSU fell below 30% for the first time since the pandemic emerged, and media speculation about alternatives to the widely expected CDU/CSU-Green coalition in September spiked.
At the federal level, opinion polls from late March show the CDU/CSU polling around 28% (down from 35% in February), The Greens 20%, the SPD 17%, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) 11%, the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) 10% and the Left Party 8%. This suggests that a coalition between The Greens, the SPD and the FDP (the so-called traffic-light grouping) could be a feasible possibility, should the polls remain stable. Our core forecast remains that a CDU/CSU-Green coalition is the most likely outcome, as a fall in coronavirus cases, a pick-up in vaccination rates and the selection of Mr Söder as chancellor candidate will ease criticism of the CDU/CSU in the coming months. However, the election looks more open now than previously.
Voter fragmentation will continue in 2021, but parties on the political extremes (the Left Party, and the AfD on the far right) are likely to remain excluded from mainstream debate and from any governing coalition. An SPD-Green-Left Party coalition might be a mathematical possibility, but the uncompromising stance of the Left Party makes this highly unlikely.
Outlook for 2021-25: International relations The European economic recovery fund clears the way for joint debt issuance (worth EUR750bn) to be channelled to EU member states with lower living standards and those hardest hit by the pandemic. From mid-2021 about EUR390bn is to be transferred in grants and the remainder through loans. The size of the fund is modest, but it will help to increase fiscal space in highly leveraged countries; Germany's U-turn on joint debt issuance in May 2020 was crucial to the agreement. The fund is a landmark step for the bloc, as it establishes a precedent for the EU to issue debt to fund common needs.
We expect US-EU relations to improve under the new US president, Joe Biden. Mr Biden will prefer diplomacy to tariffs, reducing the threat of a US-EU trade war (although existing US tariffs will remain in place). He is already returning the US to a number of multilateral platforms, including the Paris Agreement on climate change. However, on other issues-including OECD-level negotiations on a digital services tax, and EU links with China-relations will remain tense.
Various other EU external relations have come under strain. The poisoning and subsequent arrest of Alexei Navalny, a Russian opposition activist, led to new EU sanctions on Russian officials in February; and following the expulsion of European diplomats (including Germans) from Russia, Germany expelled Russian diplomats in response. The EU and China agreed in principle to conclude negotiations on a Comprehensive Agreement on Investment in December, but the ratification process by the European Parliament will be challenging, given European concerns about human rights and labour standards in China, and restrictions on allowing Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications firm, to build fifth-generation (5G) telecoms infrastructure.
Outlook for 2021-25: Policy trends Germany is now experiencing a third wave of the pandemic, which has come hard on the heels of the second wave across Europe. This is putting strains on hospital capacity and rendering the test and trace system ineffective. A new stringent lockdown has been in place since December 16th and has been extended to April 18th. Thereafter, we expect a gradual phase-out of most restrictions in line with quicker progress in Germany's vaccination programme. The vaccine rollout has been sluggish: 13.7 people had been vaccinated per 100 by March 23rd, which is marginally behind the EU average of 13.8, and compares poorly with the UK's 45.9 and the US's 38.3. Nevertheless, we expect that 70% of the population will be vaccinated by September 2021.
The European Commission has temporarily relaxed its state-aid rules, given the exceptional circumstances. We do not expect their reimposition until 2022 or 2023. Germany's state-aid disbursements comprise about half of the EU total. Firms in receipt of state aid may come under pressure to promote sustainability and to pay taxes in Germany rather than in lower-tax jurisdictions.
Other ongoing areas of policy debate include how to build industrial sovereignty, raise the resilience of supply chains and support transformation of the automotive sector towards low-emission vehicles. With The Greens all but certain to join the next federal coalition, the CDU and the SPD will both present policy programmes with a green agenda in 2021. The government's decision to support electric vehicles but not the automotive sector more generally in 2020, despite the industry's large lobby and the fact that it accounts for about 830,000 jobs, is an indication of the policy direction.
Outlook for 2021-25: Fiscal policy After six years of fiscal surpluses, the budget shifted into deficit in 2020. Germany's fiscal support and stimulus programmes are the largest in Europe, with key components including the following:

- the Kurzarbeit programme, a furlough scheme that allows firms to cut employees' working hours without having to lay them off, with the state paying at least 60% of the lost net wage payments until end-2021;
- a EUR50bn solidarity fund to help small businesses and the self-employed, and liquidity support for companies that need assistance in paying loans, irrespective of their size, totalling EUR500bn;
- a EUR3.5bn cash injection into the healthcare system, and transfers to local governments to help to manage the crisis;
- a value-added tax (VAT) cut from 19% to 16% for July-December 2020, and a reduction in VAT for the hard-hit hospitality sector to 7% until mid-2021 and until end-2022 for meals in restaurants and cafés.
- cash transfers to businesses that are forced to close under the winter lockdown, along with new tax deductions announced in February.

Germany's expansionary fiscal policy will persist during 2021; we forecast a deficit of 4% of GDP, compared with 4.8% of GDP in 2020. The Kurzarbeit programme will remain in place throughout the year and capital expenditure will be higher than before the pandemic. Over the next four years, investment will be channelled to a wide range of sectors, from artificial intelligence (AI), to the 5G rollout, to innovation in automotive manufacturers. The health fund will receive a significant boost and a large chunk of the money will go to Germany's national hydrogen strategy, as part of its energy transition.
We expect Germany's public debt to peak at about 71% of GDP at end-2021, from around 60% at end-2019. The government is taking advantage of an exception clause in the country's constitutional debt brake for crisis periods, lifting limits on new borrowing. The brake will remain suspended this year, but fiscal consolidation will then return-bringing the public debt/GDP ratio back to about 65% by end-2025, which is likely to lead to renewed tensions with southern EU members.
Outlook for 2021-25: Monetary policy The monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) will remain highly accommodative until at least the end of 2023. The overnight interbank rate has been negative since October 2014 and averaged -0.48% in February. With policy rates at their effective lower bound, monetary policy is now conducted primarily through quantitative easing (QE). The ECB restarted asset purchases in November 2019 at an average monthly pace of EUR20bn, as the euro zone economy was slowing. In 2020 the bank adopted further stimulus measures to contain the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus: an extra round of QE worth EUR120bn, a EUR1.85trn pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), liquidity injections at negative rates, and easier capital and collateral requirements for banks.
We expect the ECB to use the PEPP envelope in full. Therefore, after EUR1.1trn of total asset purchases in 2020, we expect additional purchases worth around EUR1.1trn in 2021 and EUR460bn in 2022. The bank will maintain its QE programme into 2023, when we forecast that inflation will continue to undershoot its target of just below 2%. We do not expect policy rates to increase by the end of 2025.
In March the ECB committed to front-loading asset purchases in the second quarter of 2021, to offset rising sovereign yields and preserve favourable financing conditions. Euro zone banks tightened credit standards for businesses in the second half of 2020, owing to increased risk perception. However, borrowing costs remain at historically low levels, and we expect this to continue.
Outlook for 2021-25: Economic growth The economy contracted by 5.3% in 2020-the first annual fall since the 5.6% contraction in the wake of the global financial crisis. This was a less severe downturn than in the other major economies in western Europe; real GDP fell by 8.3% in France, 9.9% in the UK and 11% in Spain. Germany's better outturn reflects less stringent lockdowns, high levels of government support and a large manufacturing sector-equivalent to 20% of gross value added, and closely tied to the strongly recovering Chinese market-which was able to continue operating with social-distancing measures in place.
We expect real German GDP to return to 98.1% of its 2019 full-year size in 2021, a quicker recovery than the west European average, with annual growth of 3.5%. The industrial sector has been hit less severely by the second lockdown, and Germany's export-oriented manufacturing firms are benefiting from growing demand in China and other Asian markets. China overtook France as Germany's second-largest export destination in 2020, and our forecast of 8.5% GDP growth in China in 2021 will keep demand for German exports elevated. Consumers will maintain high precautionary savings this year, but much of the forced savings resulting from lockdowns and deferred investment will be drawn down to satisfy pent-up demand in the second quarter, once restrictions are lifted. The Kurzarbeit scheme has been extended to end-2021, which will support disposable incomes. However, in-person services will take longer to recover, and the immediate outlook is not promising. After a decrease in 2020, owing to deferred reporting obligations and massive government financial support, we expect a rise in bankruptcies this year.
In 2022 we expect strong carryover effects and improving macroeconomic conditions across emerging markets to drive growth of 4%. We then forecast a moderation to 1.9% annual average growth in 2023-25. Germany's poor demographic outlook will constrain potential growth as the working-age population declines, exacerbated by a fall in net immigration during the pandemic. Technological disruption to the automotive sector also represents a structural risk: Germany has been slow to shift emphasis towards electric vehicles. Efforts to reduce supply-chain dependence on China may result in some reshoring of production, but as labour costs in Europe are higher, we do not expect this to result in a surge in job creation. Instead, automation and digitisation will gain pace, and supply-chain linkages with existing suppliers in central and eastern Europe will strengthen.
Outlook for 2021-25: Inflation Consumer prices rose by just 0.4% in 2020, reflecting low oil prices, the hit to demand from the coronavirus and the cut to the VAT rate in July-December. January 2021 saw a change in trend, with annual inflation rising to 1.6% as a consequence of the end of the VAT cut, new carbon emissions certificates raising transport and heating costs, and a minimum-wage rise. Annual price growth will remain above the euro zone average in 2021 as a consequence of these changes in administered prices, averaging 1.8%, and exceeding 2% in the second half of the year (when the base period will include the 2020 VAT cut). We expect inflation to moderate to an annual average of 1.6% in 2022-25, allowing for a continuation of the ECB's accommodative monetary policy.
Outlook for 2021-25: Exchange rates The euro experienced high volatility throughout 2020. A depreciation against the US dollar in the early months of the year, when the coronavirus forced European countries into lockdowns, was followed by a rapid appreciation after the EU announced the establishment of a new recovery fund worth EUR750bn. After ending the year at US$1.23:EUR1, we expect the euro to depreciate gradually against the US dollar in 2021-23, owing to a protracted economic recovery and continued monetary accommodation from the ECB, which will maintain its ultra-loose policy stance for longer than the Federal Reserve (the US central bank). The euro will strengthen from 2024 onwards, supported by the gradual unwinding of the ECB's asset purchases and by the euro zone's structural current-account surplus.
Outlook for 2021-25: External sector Germany's current-account surpluses were the largest in the world in nominal terms in the four years to 2019, and we expect them to be so again from 2021, after temporarily falling below China last year. They are underpinned by huge trade surpluses, reflecting the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector. This will continue to generate large domestic savings that are mainly invested abroad, leading to a solid primary income surplus.
We expect the 2020 recession to have caused a decline in Germany's trade surplus, as the fall in exports outstripped the fall in imports. We estimate the current-account surplus at the equivalent of 6.9% of GDP-down from an annual average of 7.8% in the previous six years. Trade and primary income surpluses will comfortably outweigh narrow structural deficits on the services and secondary income accounts throughout our forecast period. In 2021-25 we forecast that the external surplus will average 6.7% of GDP as world trade volumes and investment flows recover.
