# Running Python--Managing Code

## What I would like everyone in this class to use
- I'd like someone in each group to have the following software on a local computer
    - With that said I want this class to remain accessible and this will not be a requirement
* **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    * A free and popular code editor that helps you write and organize code for various projects, with special features for Python and data science.

* **Git/Github Desktop:** [https://desktop.github.com/download/](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
    * A system that records changes you make to your code, allowing you to go back to previous versions and collaborate smoothly with others.
    

* **uv - A Fast Python Package Manager:** [https://uv.pypi.org/](https://uv.pypi.org/)
    * A newer, very fast tool specifically designed to install and manage Python libraries for your data science projects more efficiently than traditional methods.


## Explore and Code Online

* **Google Colaboratory (Colab):** [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)
    * A free online coding notebook where you can write and run Python code in your web browser, ideal for learning and experimenting with data.
* **Deepnote:** [https://deepnote.com/](https://deepnote.com/)
    * A collaborative online notebook designed for data science teams to work together on code and analysis in real-time.

## Your Personal Coding Workshop

* **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    * A free and popular code editor that helps you write and organize code for various projects, with special features for Python and data science.

## Key Tools for Python Data Science

* **Anaconda:** [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
    * A free collection of Python and data science tools, including many pre-installed libraries that are essential for data analysis and machine learning.
* **Jupyter:** [https://jupyter.org/try](https://jupyter.org/try)
    * An open-source way to create documents that blend code, explanations, and visualizations, very common for data exploration and sharing insights.
* **pip:** (Usually comes with Python)
    * The standard tool for installing and managing extra Python libraries that provide specialized functions for data analysis, machine learning, and more.
* **uv - A Fast Python Package Manager:** [https://uv.pypi.org/](https://uv.pypi.org/)
    * A newer, very fast tool specifically designed to install and manage Python libraries for your data science projects more efficiently than traditional methods.

## Keeping Track of Your Code Changes

* **Git:** [https://git-scm.com/download](https://git-scm.com/download)
    * A system that records changes you make to your code, allowing you to go back to previous versions and collaborate smoothly with others.
    * **Understanding the Command Line (Terminal):**
        * `ls`: Lists all the files and folders in your current location on your computer.
        * `cd <folder_name>`: Changes your current location to the specified folder. Use `cd ..` to go back one folder.
    * **Basic Git Commands:**
        * `git branch`: Shows you a list of all the "branches" in your project. Branches are like separate timelines of your code changes. The current branch is usually marked with an asterisk (*).
        * `git checkout -b 'newbranch'`: Creates a new branch named 'newbranch' and immediately switches you to work on that new branch. This is useful for trying out new ideas without affecting your main code.
        * `git status`: Tells you the current state of your project, such as which files have been changed but not yet saved, or which branch you are currently on.
        * `git add <filename>` or `git add .`: Stages your changes, meaning you are telling Git that you want to include these changes in your next save point. Use `git add .` to stage all changed files in the current folder and its subfolders.
        * `git commit -m 'Your descriptive message'`: Saves your staged changes with a brief description of what you did. This creates a snapshot of your project at that point in time.
