## Overview
- Run the code/notebooks in the cloud via Binder
  - [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Data-Science-Public-Policy/graspp_2025_spring/HEAD)

- Course materials for "Data Science for Public Policy", a course at the University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Public Policy ([Graspp](https://www.pp.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/))
- Instructor: Cory Baird

## Course Objectives

- Use Python to collect, clean, and analyze policy-relevant data.
- Design and implement reproducible research workflows to effectively manage and utilize public data.
- Apply statistical and machine learning methods to analyze policy problems 
- Process and analyze text data using traditional NLP and modern LLMs (ChatGPT) to extract meaningful insights.
- Develop visualization to communicate research findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.
- Collaborate effectively using professional data science tools like GitHub, Overleaf, and Google Colab.

## Necessary software

* **Code version control: Git/Github**
    * [**GitHub Account**](https://github.com/): Create account then "star" [class page](https://github.com/Data-Science-Public-Policy/graspp_2025_spring)
    * [**GitHub Desktop:**](https://desktop.github.com/) For collaboration on code/notebooks
    * **Git software:** [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
        * git software is automatically downloaded with github desktop for mac but may not be for windows

* **Running code AND notebooks**
    * **VSCode:** For running notebooks and code ([Download Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))
        * Sublime/PyCharm also acceptable
    * **UV:** Python version control and running notebooks ([Download Link](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))

* If you are having issues running the previous software
  * The easiest way is to use github code space: This launches vscode in the cloud
  * Other solutions:
      * Anaconda: [https://www.anaconda.com/](https://www.anaconda.com/)
      * Jupyter.org Try: [https://jupyter.org/try](https://jupyter.org/try)
      * Google Colab: [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)
      * pip: The standard tool for installing and managing extra Python libraries that provide specialized functions for data analysis, machine learning, and more.
